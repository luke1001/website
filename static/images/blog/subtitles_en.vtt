00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.590
We’ve been talking about the answer to “How
can anyone be sure they have a healthy relationship

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.650
with God?”

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.459
There’s a Bible verse that sums up the answer
to that question.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.440
It’s in the Apostle Paul’s letter to the
Christians in Roman, chapter 6, verse 23.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.290
The passage says: “The wages of sin is death
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.200
Jesus our Lord.”

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.090
I’ve found this diagram helpful to understand
this passage.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.579
See what you think.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.219
The first part of Romans 6:23 talks about
what God demands of us and how we fail to

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.350
live up to his demands.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.670
“The wages of sin is death.”

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.489
Sin is anything we do or say or think that
doesn’t measure up to what God wants from

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.499
us.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.649
It is anything that is contrary to who God
is.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.210
The 10 Commandments summarize how God wants
us to live.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.870
They talk about putting him first in our lives,
showing him respect and worshiping him with

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.620
everything we do.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.760
They talk about showing love and respect to
everyone else.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.470
We do that when we obey the people God has
placed in positions of responsibility over

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.170
us, when we protect the lives of others, when
we live sexually moral lives, when we help

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.110
others keep their property and good name,
when we are satisfied with what God gives

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.110
us.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640
I don’t keep any of those commandments as
I should.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.310
What about you?

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.320
Actually the Bible says, no one lives according
to God’s commandments.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.880
In Romans 3:23 the Bible says, "There is no
difference [between any of us], for all have

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.990
sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.280
There’s a price to pay for committing sins,
a punishment that comes along with sin.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
This verse talks about a wage that sin pays.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.420
Usually wages are something we look forward
to.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.120
But the wages of sin are far from a positive.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.720
“The wages of sin is death.”

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.810
The rest of the Bible makes it plain that
these wages are not just having bodies that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.950
will die some day.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.480
The death that our sins earn is eternal death
in the most horrible torture chamber you could

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.650
imagine.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.709
The Bible says that those who do not obey
God “will be punished with everlasting destruction”

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:37.810
(1 TH 1:9).

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.650
That’s one of the ways the Bible describes
hell.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.180
So the consequence of any amount of sin is
eternal death, eternal punishment in hell.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.180
No one should think that they can avoid that
fate because we all sin, because we all fall

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.260
short of what God demands of us.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.209
But look again at Romans 6:23.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.260
The next word is only three letters but it
changes everything.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.530
But.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.910
It is a transitional word.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.950
Hell is what we should expect from God, BUT....

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.860
In spite of the wages of our sins, God has
a different outcome in store for us.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.770
God has a gift for us instead of the punishment
we deserve.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.450
His gift is eternal life with him in heaven.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.740
How could that be?

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.890
God is the most just of all judges.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.570
We would not expect that a just judge would
let a criminal simply go free.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.080
But God hasn’t stopped being a just judge
by relieving us of the wages of our sins and

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.990
giving us eternal life.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.830
What he arranged for was for someone else
to take responsibility for the wages of our

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.400
sins, for someone else to be paid our wages
so we don’t have to face those consequences.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.430
That’s what God did for us by sending his
Son, Jesus, to earth.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:26.310
“...But the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.190
The reason Jesus left heaven to live on earth
and to die on the cross was to pay for all

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.720
of our sins.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.330
Jesus lived a sin-free life, the kind of life
God demands of us but we don’t live.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.370
When he died on the cross, he suffered the
punishment in hell we have earned for ourselves

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.889
with our sins.

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:54.110
And he was able to live a perfect enough life
and suffer enough punishment when he hung

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.870
on the cross to cover every sin that will
ever be committed because he is the infinite

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.240
Son of God.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.400
The infinite Son of God paid for an infinite
number of our sins.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.560
So the Bible tells us in Romans 5:8, "God
demonstrates his own love for us in this:

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.940
while we were still sinners, Christ died for
us."

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.199
Jesus took our place, he died for us, he suffered
the eternal death that we should have experience.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:32.120
And in Romans 5:11 it says, "We also rejoice
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.320
whom we have now received reconciliation."

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.350
Reconciliation means that Jesus has made us
God’s dear friends; we are no longer his

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.250
enemies who deserve his angry punishment.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:52.430
There is no better news than this: “The
wages of sin is death but the gift of God

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.240
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.330
That means, no matter what the sins are that
you have committed, they are all forgiven

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.780
in Jesus.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.400
You have a Savior.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.440
Your Savior is the Lord, the eternal God,
who promised that he could come to earth to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.050
forgive our sins.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.430
And because Jesus didn’t just die to forgive
us but came back to life three days later,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.260
we can be sure beyond all doubt that he accomplished
his mission.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.880
Through his life, death and resurrection,
Jesus guarantees that he has completely paid

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.290
for our sins, saved us from their punishment,
and has given us eternal life with him in

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.290
heaven.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.420
Would you read this verse out loud with me:
“The wages of sin is death but the gift

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.220
of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our
Lord.”

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.730
That’s his gift to you.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.720
Do you believe this?

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.760
[Yes.]

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.789
Then this gift from God belongs to you.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.199
Your sins are forgiven.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.530
Eternal life in heaven is waiting for you.
