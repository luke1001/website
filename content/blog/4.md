马可福音(Mark) 1:16-18

16 耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门，和西门的兄弟安得烈，在海边撒网。他们本是打鱼的。

As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

17 耶稣对他们说，来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。

“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”

18 他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。

At once they left their nets and followed him.

约翰福音(John 21⁄21)

4 天将亮的时候，耶稣站在岸上。门徒却不知道是耶稣。

Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.

5 耶稣就对他们说，小子，你们有吃的没有。他们回答说，没有。

He called out to them, “Friends, haven’t you any fish?” “No,” they answered.

6 耶稣说，你们把网撒在船的右边，就必得着。他们便撒下网去，竟拉不上来了，因为鱼甚多。

He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.

灵，魂，体

帖撒罗尼迦前书(1Thessalonians 5⁄5)

23 愿赐平安的神，亲自使你们全然成圣。又愿你们的灵，与魂，与身子，得蒙保守，在我主耶稣基督降临的时候，完全无可指摘。

May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

24 那召你们的本是信实的，他必成就这事。

The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.

物有本末，事有终始。知所先后，则近道矣。

马太福音(Matthew) 6:31-33

31 所以不要忧虑，说，吃什么，喝什么，穿什么。

So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

32 这都是外邦人所求的。你们需用的这一切东西，你们的天父是知道的。

For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

33 你们要先求他的国，和他的义。这些东西都要加给你们了。

But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

物有本末，事有终始。知所先后，则近道矣。

创世记(Genesis) 2:7

耶和华神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人，名叫亚当。

the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

气-breath：灵。 正气，生气，骨气，社会风气，歪风邪气，灵气，义气…

约翰福音(John 6⁄21)

63 叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话，就是灵，就是生命。 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.

箴言(Proverbs 4⁄31)

23 你要保守你心，胜过保守一切。因为一生的果效，是由心发出。

Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.

灵，魂，身体

灵魂 — 信心 —〉本：因信称义

身体 — 行为 —〉末：因行为称义

因信心（灵魂）和由信心而发生的善行（身体）称义—基督信仰

信心和行为是一个整体，不可分割， 正如我们的灵魂和身体是一个整体一样。

提摩太后书(2Timothy 3⁄4)

16 圣经都是神所默示的，于教训，督责，使人归正，教导人学义，都是有益的。

All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

17 叫属神的人得以完全，豫备行各样的善事。

so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

信心 — 神导 （电导）：电灯泡与电相通，发光（行善）的大小与电导成正比。电灯泡本身不能发光，也不能与电源主动相连-需要外来的力量-神的工。

罪 — 神阻 （电阻），与神隔绝，电灯泡与电隔绝，不能发光 （行善）。

信心和行为是一个整体，不可分割

雅各书(James) 2:14-22

14 我的弟兄们，若有人说，自己有信心，却没有行为，有什么益处呢。这信心能救他么。

What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?

15 若是弟兄，或是姐妹，赤身露体，又缺了日用的饮食，

Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.

16 你们中间有人对他们说，平平安安的去吧，愿你们穿得暖吃得饱。却不给他们身体所需用的，这有什么益处呢。

If one of you says to him, “Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?

17 这样信心若没有行为就是死的。

In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

18 必有人说，你有信心，我有行为。你将你没有行为的信心指给我看，我便藉着我的行为，将我的信心指给你看。

But someone will say, 聯You have faith; I have deeds.聰 Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.

19 你信神只有一位，你信的不错。鬼魔也信，却是战兢。

You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that聳and shudder.

20 虚浮的人哪，你愿意知道没有行为的信心是死的么。

You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless ?

21 我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕，把他儿子以撒献在坛上，岂不是因行为称义么。

Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

22 可见信心是与他的行为并行，而且信心因着行为才得成全。

You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.

求鱼（身体）得渔（灵魂体）

由信心而发生的行为蒙神的喜悦，没有信心的行为，既不蒙神的喜悦，也与自己无益。

以赛亚书(Isaiah 1）：10-13

10 你们这所多玛的官长阿，要听耶和华的话。你们这蛾摩拉的百姓阿，要侧耳听我们的神的训诲。

Hear the word of the LORD , you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!

11 耶和华说，你们所献的许多祭物，与我何益呢。公绵羊的燔祭，和肥畜的脂油，我已经彀了。公牛的血，羊羔的血，公山羊的血，我都不喜悦。

“The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?” says the LORD . “I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.

12 你们来朝见我，谁向你们讨这些，使你们践踏我的院宇呢。

When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?

13 你们不要再献虚浮的供物。香品是我所憎恶的。月朔，和安息日，并宣召的大会，也是我所憎恶的。作罪孽，又守严肃会，我也不能容忍。

Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies.

A Butterfly’s Lesson ”One day, a small opening appeared in a cocoon; a man sat and watched for the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.

Then, it seems to stop making any progress.

It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could not go any further.

So the man decided to help the butterfly: he took a pair of scissors and opened the cocoon.

The butterfly then emerged easily.

But it had a withered body, it was tiny and shriveled wings.

The man continued to watch because he expected that, at any moment, the wings would open, enlarge and expand, to be able to support the butterfly’s body, and become firm.

Neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a withered body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.

What the man, in his kindness and his goodwill did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get through the tiny opening, were nature’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings, so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.

Sometimes, struggles are exactly what we need in our life.

有时，挑战正是我们生命中需要的。

If we were allowed to go through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as we could have been. Never been able to fly.

生命中若无困境，我们将是残缺的。既不强壮，更不能翱翔。

I asked for Strength… and I was given difficulties to make me strong.

我祈求力量，却得到困境让我成为强壮。

I asked for Wisdom… and I was given problems to solve.

我祈求智慧，却得到问题去解决。

I asked for prosperity… and I was given a brain and brawn to work.

我祈求发达，却得到头脑和肌肉去工作。

I asked for Courage….. and I was given obstacles to overcome.

我祈求勇气，却得到障碍去跨越。

I asked for Love… and I was given troubled people to help.

我祈求爱，却得到困境中需要帮助的人去服侍。

‘中国最美夫妻’

失明妻子瘫痪丈夫47年不离弃

I asked for Favors… And I was given Opportunities.

我祈求蒙恩，得到的是机遇。

“I received nothing I wanted… But I received everything I needed.“

我得到我需要的，而非我想要的

求渔得渔

雅各书(James) 1

2 我的弟兄们，你们落在百般的试炼中，都要以为大喜乐。

Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,

3 因为知道你们的信心经过试验就生忍耐。

because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.

4 但忍耐也当成功，使你们成全完备，毫无缺欠。

Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
