Lesson 6 – Luke, chapter 14 Lessons Over Dinner, the Cost of Following
第六课——路加福音第14章  在筵席上的教训，作门徒的代价
Getting Started   In chapter 14 Jesus is most likely still traveling through the villages of Judea. He has several months of ministry left, and his goal is to end up in Jerusalem for Passover, so that he, the true Passover Lamb, could be for the sins of the world. Once again, Luke is more concerned about the “what” than he is about the “where.” So the place of the dinner party in verse 1 remains unnamed, and from where and to where the large crowds are traveling in verse 25 remains unstated. More important is that many people heard the teachings of Jesus.
导 言  在第十四章耶稣极可能仍然行走在犹太地的村子里。他还有几个月的事工时间，他的目标是最终在耶路撒冷过逾越节，这样耶稣——真正的逾越节羔羊，为世上的罪献上为祭。再次说明，路加更关注“发生了什么”，而不是“地点”。所以在第一节里晚宴的地点仍然没有提及，在第25节中一大群人的行程也没交代。最重要的是很多人听到了耶稣的教导。
Luke 14:1-14    Jesus at a Pharisee’s House
路加福音14:1-14   耶稣在法利赛人家中
1.   What is significant about this incident taking place in the home of a Pharisee?

[A note on the illness: “Dropsy,” now called oedema, is the build-up of large amounts of excess fluid beneath the skin or in other cavities of the body. It is usually caused by a problem with the blood vessels.]
[ 疾病注释：“水臌，”现在称为水肿，就是皮肤下或身体其他空腔大量剩余液体积聚。通常是因血管问题导致。]
2.    Compare this Sabbath Day healing to the one in 13:10-17. What did Jesus do differently in regard to this one in chapter 14? What is the significance of that difference?

5.   After the healing of the man, Jesus wants to teach his host two important lessons. The first has to do with humility. How does the parable in verses 8-10 illustrate the truth in verse 11?

      举一个我们日常生活中的例子来说明基督徒因为以基督为中心承担谦卑而不同于非基督徒。

8.    The second lesson for the Pharisee has to do with why one performs acts of kindness. Think of a modern-day example of how this truth might be displayed by a Christian.

9.    Explain verse 14. Give examples of things said by Jesus which are similar to this.
