Lesson 9 – Luke, chapter 17 Sin, Forgiveness, Faith, and the Coming of the Kingdom
第九课-路加福音，第17章 罪，赦免，信心和将来的国度

Getting Started At the beginning of the chapter Jesus once again turns his words away from the crowd to his disciples only. He has important lessons for them on forgiveness and faith. The section ends with a parable that teaches a lesson about the attitude that is present in humble faith. In verse 11 Luke reports the beginning of the final phase of Jesus’ trip to Jerusalem. The reference to the border between Samaria and Galilee might lead us to believe that Jesus was quite far north, when previously he had been in and around Judea. It seems unusual that he would go north again before heading to Jerusalem. The problem may be resolved by the possibility that Luke is referring to the area of Perea, east of the Jordan River, as Galilee, for that area was also ruled by Herod Antipas, from whom Jesus was told to flee in Luke 13. The healing of the ten lepers and the remainder of the chapter all have to do with the coming of Christ’s kingdom.
入题 ：本章一开始，耶稣就再次把话题从全会众转到了门徒身上。他要对门徒进行有关赦免和信心方面的重要教导。这一部分的结尾是一个比喻，它教导了由谦卑的信心所产生的态度。在第十一节中，路加报道了耶稣去耶路撒冷的最后一段路程的开始部分。因为提到撒玛利亚和加利利之间的边界，可能会使我们相信耶稣在很靠北的地方，而在这之前耶稣在犹大地或附近。看起来有些反常的是，在耶稣去耶路撒冷之前，他会又往北走。这个问题可以这样解决：路加所说的加利利可能指的是约旦河东的比利亚，因为当时这个地方也是由希律王安提帕统治，也就是路加福音13章中有人告诉耶稣要离开躲避的希律。对十个大麻风病人的得医治，以及本章的其余部分都是有关基督国度的再来的。
