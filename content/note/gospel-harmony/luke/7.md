Lesson 5 – Luke, chapter 13 Repentance and Readiness
第五课——路加福音第13章 悔改和预备

Getting Started   The content of chapter 13 seems to follow naturally the material included at the end of chapter 12. Most likely this is part of the same lengthy dialog that took place after Jesus had left the Pharisee’s dinner party (11:53 – 12:1). At the end of chapter 12 Jesus had encouraged his listeners to “interpret the times.” What follows at the beginning of chapter 13 seems to be the crowd’s response to that very encouragement. It is likely that they referred to these two tragedies at the beginning of chapter 13 as signs of God’s judgment against sin. As always, Jesus’ emphasis is on the importance of individual repentance and faith, a theme stressed throughout the chapter.
导言 第十三章的内容似乎自然承接了第十二章结尾包含的话题。很可能这是在耶稣已经离开法利赛人的晚宴后(11:53 – 12:1) 发生的那段长对话的一部分。第十二章结尾处耶稣已经勉励听众“分辨时候”。紧接着在第十三章的开始看起来是群众对那勉励的反应。在第十三章开始他们提及那两个灾难并认为那是神对罪的审判的征兆。耶稣一如既往的看重个人的悔改和信心，这也是贯穿本章所强调的主题。
Luke 13:1-9    Repent or Perish!
路加福音13:1-9   悔改或灭亡！
1. Verses 1-5 speak of an act of terror and a deadly accident. How does the crowd seem to interpret these two events? What does Jesus say our reaction to such tragedies should be?
第1-5节 讲到一件引起恐慌的事和一桩伤亡事故。我们可以看出人们是如何解释这两件事的？耶稣说我们对于这样的悲剧事件应当如何回应？
2. What is the Christian response to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons, and tsunamis?
对于自然灾难，像地震，台风，海啸 ，基督徒的回应是什么？
3. What is the point of the parable in verses 6 – 9? (See 2 Peter 3:9.)
 第6-9节中的比喻的要点是什么？（参看彼后3:9.)
Luke 13:10-17    Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman
路加福音13:10-17   耶稣医治驼背的女人
4. What was the cause of this woman’s condition? (The Greek says she had “a spirit of weakness.”) See also verse 16.
造成这女人如此状况的原因是什么？（ 希腊文说她被“虚弱的鬼”附）同时参看第十六节。
5. Why is it significant that Luke, a doctor, describes the illness the way he does?
为什么路加，一个医生，他描述这个疾病的方式有重要意义？
6. What is the difference between Jesus’ concern and the synagogue ruler’s concern?
耶稣所关心的事和管会堂的人有什么不同？
7. Describe the double reaction to this miracle.
描述对这个神迹的两种回应？
Luke 13:18-21    Familiar Parables Repeated
路加福音13:18-21 重复熟悉的比喻
8. State once again the main point of each of these parables. What lessons do we learn from these parables in regard to our own work for the Lord?
再次阐述每个比喻的要点。关于我们为主的事工方面，我们从这些比喻中学到的功课是什么？
Luke 13:22-30    The Narrow Door
路加福音13:22-30  窄门
(Note: Whether or not Jesus had already arrived in Jerusalem is unclear. Portions of chapters 11 and 12 sound as if they were taking place in Jerusalem. Here Jesus is traveling from town to town in the Judean countryside, on his way to, or back to, Jerusalem. Luke is not concerned about the exact route. He’s more concerned that the readers go along on the spiritual journey.)
（注意：耶稣是否已经到达耶路撒冷，情况不清楚。第十一章和十二章中一些部分听起来好像发生在耶路撒冷。这里，耶稣正穿行在犹太地乡下的各镇之间，可能是朝向或者是返回耶路撒冷的路上。路加不关心确切的路线。他更关心的是读者能随着这属灵的旅程同行。）
9. Some of the rabbis of Jesus’ day taught that all of the Israelites would be part of God’s eternal kingdom simply because they were part of God’s chosen people. Some of what Jesus had been teaching had looked at the matter from a different point of view. Can you give an example or two from chapter 13?
耶稣时代的一些犹太拉比教导说因为所有以色列人都是神拣选的子民，所以他们都将属于神的永恒的国度，就是。耶稣所教导的一些内容以不同的观点看待这个问题。你能从第十三章中找出一两个例子吗?
10. “Make every effort” implies hard work, and “narrow” implies that only one person at a time can enter “the house.” How do these things picture salvation by grace alone through faith in Christ?
“努力”意味着竭尽全力，“窄”意味着一次只有一人能进入“屋子”。这些事如何描绘出救赎是唯靠恩典籍着在基督里的信心得着？
11. Compare verses 25 – 30 to Matthew 7:21-23, Matthew 8:10-12, Matthew 25:10-12. What common themes do you find in all of these readings?
比较第25-30节和太7:21-23节，太8:10-12，25:10-12节。你在所有这样经文中发现有什么共同的主题？
Luke 13:31-35    Jesus’ Sorrow Over Jerusalem
路加福音13:31-35 耶稣为耶路撒冷悲伤
12. Some have interpreted verse 31 to mean that Jesus was still in the area of Perea (east of the Jordan River) where Herod Antipas was the ruler. There are two possibilities as to why the Pharisees would report this to Jesus. What are the two ways of looking at their warning?
一些人认为第31节是说耶稣仍然在比利亚（约旦河以东），希律安提帕统治的地方。至于为什么法利赛人向耶稣报告这事，有两种可能。他们向耶稣示警的两种可能性是什么？
13. Explain Jesus’ response in verses 32 and 33. (Note what is meant by “fox,” how Jesus describes his commitment to his work, and what might be meant by the reference to three days.)
解释在第32和33节耶稣的回应。（注意“狐狸”意指什么？耶稣怎样阐述祂对自己的事工的承诺，以及提及3天可能是什么意思）
14. Jesus’ words about Jerusalem in verses 34-35 are quoted by Matthew in Mt 23:37-39. How is the setting Matthew describes different from the setting described by Luke? How do you explain the fact that each writer records the same words in a different setting?
 在第34-35节中，耶稣关于耶路撒冷的言论在太23:37-39被马太引用。马太描述的场景和路加描述的场景有何不同？你怎样解释两位作者记录了同样的话但放在不同的场景中？
15. “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD” (Ps 118:26) was part of the Jewish liturgy for great festival days. How would these words find two fulfillments in the future?
 “奉耶和华名来的是应当称颂的”（诗篇118:26)是为盛大的节日的犹太礼拜仪式的一部分。这些字句中有哪两处将要应验？
16. Summarize what you learned about “readiness” in this chapter.
 总结你在本章中所学到有关“预备”的信息。
