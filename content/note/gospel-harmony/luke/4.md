第二课——路加福音第10章
The Synoptic Gospels – Course B – Luke
符类福音——课程B——路加福音
Lesson 2 – Luke, chapter 10 Good Mission, Good Samaritan,
Good Advice
第二课——路加福音第十章 好使命，好撒玛利亚人，好忠告
Getting Started We pick up our study in Luke, chapter 10. We can see how this portion of Luke’s gospel fits into Jesus’ ministry by looking at the harmony that was distributed with Lesson 1. Notice that in Luke 9:51 Jesus is headed from Galilee to Jerusalem. This trip to Jerusalem is for the Feast of Tabernacles, which took place in September-October before his death and resurrection the next spring. His conversation with the Jews at the time of the Feast is recorded in John, chapters 7-10a. Our study begins at the conclusion of that conversation. Until his death and resurrection the next spring Jesus would preach, teach, and heal in Judea and Perea (east of Judea, across the Jordan Valley), spending a consideration amount of time in and around Jerusalem. Our study of selections from Luke stops with Luke 18:14, when the events Luke writes about are also covered by Matthew and Mark.
导言 我们从第10章来继续路加福音的学习。通过查看在第一课中被破坏的和谐，我们可以看到路加福音的这部分内容如何与耶稣的事工相吻合。请注意在路9:51节中耶稣要从加利利前往耶路撒冷。此次耶城之行是为了过住棚节，时间是在耶稣受难与复活的前一年的9-10月之间，是在来年的春天。约翰福音第7-10a章记录了祂与犹太人在此节期期间的谈话。我们的学习始于这段谈话的结尾。耶稣在犹大地，和比利亚（犹大地东部，横穿约旦峡谷），传道，教导，和医治，花大量时间在耶路撒冷和其附近进行事工，直到第二年春天受难并复活。我们从路加福音节选的学习内容到路18:14为止，因为路加在这以后所写的事件也被马太福音和马可福音涵括。

Luke 10:1-24 Jesus Sends Out the Seventy-Two
路加福音10:1-24 耶稣差遣72门徒
1. Jesus is on his way from Galilee to Judea and would therefore have to travel through Samaria, an area that was avoided by most Jews. (The Jews considered the Samaritans to be polluted, both racially and spiritually. This dates back to the deportation and occupation of Samaria by the Assyrians more than 700 years before Christ.) This “sending” was different from the sending of the 12 apostles, which Luke described in Luke 9, and which we studied earlier in Matthew 10.
What conclusion can we draw from this second sending of the 72 (some early manuscripts read “70”)? (Consider also the words of verse 2.) Is there a lesson in this for today’s church?
耶稣在从加利利前往犹大地的路上，因此就要经过一个大多数犹太人回避的地方，撒玛利亚。（犹太人认为撒玛利亚人血统和灵性上不纯。这可追溯到主前700多年撒玛利亚被亚述人占领，撒玛利亚人被流放。）这次“差遣”不同于路加在第九章所记录的12门徒的差遣，我们前面在马太福音第10章也学到。从这第二次差遣72（一些早期手稿作“70”）门徒我们可以得出什么结论？ ( 思考第二节经文。) 对于今天的教会这里有没有教导什么功课？
2. What lessons can we learn for the Lord’s work today in the following verses?
对于今天神的事工，我们可以从以下的经节中学到哪些功课？
V. 3
V. 4
Vv. 5-8
V. 9
Vv. 10-12
3. Bethsaida, Korazin, and Capernaum were towns in Galilee where Jesus had done much preaching, teaching and healing. What strong point is Jesus making in verses 13-15?
伯赛大，哥拉汛，和迦百农都是加利利地区的城镇，在那里耶稣进行大量的传道，教导，和医治。在13-15节里耶稣要说明什么重要信息？
4. How does verse 16 serve as an encouragement to the 72? to us?
第16节经文怎样成为对72个 门徒的鼓励？ 对我们呢？

5. In verse 17 the 72 evaluate their temporary ministry with a great deal of enthusiastic joy. How does Jesus’ reaction to their joy in verses 18-20 become both an encouragement and a humbling reminder about priorities?
在17节，72个门徒兴高采烈地评论着他们短暂的事工。耶稣在18-20节中对于门徒们的喜乐的回应如何既是一个鼓舞，又是一个对于优先顺序的谦卑提醒？
6. What are the “things” that are grasped by little children but not by the “wise and learned”?
什么事孩童能领会，但“聪明通达人”却不明白？
7. Verse 22 is a natural follow-up to the thoughts of verse 21. In what way?
22节是21节观点的自然延续。以什么方式？
8.The “knowing” of verse 22 is a full knowledge based on experience. How is the knowledge between Father and Son different from the knowledge between God and “those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him”?
在22节中的“知道”是基于经验而有的全面的认知。天父和圣子之间的认知与神和“那些子所愿意指示的”人之间的认知有什么不同？
9. What is the message “for disciples only” in verses 23-24? What does that message say to us?
在23-24节中“只对门徒”讲的信息是什么？这个信息告诉我们什么？

Luke 10:25-37 The Parable of the Good Samaritan
路加福音10:25-37 好撒玛利亚人的比喻
10. How do verses 25-29 prepare us for finding the purpose of this parable? Clearly state that purpose.
路25-29节怎样预备我们找到这个比喻的意图？清楚阐述它的意图。
11. Look at the two groups of people Jesus speaks about in verse 21. How are those two groups represented in this parable?
观察耶稣在21节中谈及的两组人。这 两组人是如何在这个比喻中出现的？
12. How do the characters Jesus used (priest, Levite, Samaritan) strengthen the parable’s point?
耶稣在比喻中所用的人物（祭司，利未人，撒玛利亚人）如何加强了寓意？
(Consider what we said about Samaritans in number 1.)(思考我们在第一部分谈到关于撒玛利亚人的内容。)
13. Many people think that the main point of this parable is “be kind to all people.” Explain how that idea misses the main point of the parable.
很多人认为这个比喻的寓意是“善待所有人。”请解释为何这种观点误解了这个比喻的要点。
Luke 10:38-41 At Mary and Martha’s Home
路加福音10:38-41 在马大和马利亚家
