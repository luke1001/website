The Synoptic Gospels – Course B – Luke
福音书-课程B-路加福音
Lesson 8 – Luke, chapter 16 Teaching Stewardship and the Way to Heaven
第八课-路加福音16章-教导管家与天堂之路

Getting Started Jesus and his disciples are still traveling in Judea during the last months of his ministry. They are most likely somewhere in and around Judea and will end up in Jerusalem for Passover. Luke introduces chapter 16 with the words Jesus told his disciples. Chapter 16 picks up where chapter 15 leaves off. The difference is that the content of chapter 15 was aimed at the crowds, whereas in the beginning of chapter 16 Jesus narrows his focus on his disciples. A heart must be touched with love for Jesus before it can achieve a proper attitude toward material things. The topic grabs the attention of the Pharisees, who have been listening in and who have a keen interest in the topic. Jesus uses their sneering as an opportunity to teach what is most important in life.
入题 ：在耶稣事工的最后几个月里，他与门徒仍穿行于犹大地。他们很可能就在犹大境内或附近，最后到了耶路撒冷过逾越节。第16章中，路加以“耶稣又对门徒说”为开始。第16章接续的是第15章留下的内容。两章的区别在于，第15章的内容是针对会众的。而在第16章开始时，耶稣就把焦点转移到门徒身上了。人心只有在受感动而去爱耶稣时，才能对物质的东西拥有正确的态度。这个话题引起了法利赛人的注意，他们一直在留意听这个话题，并且对这个话题有强烈的兴趣。耶稣利用他们的嘲笑，并借机教导生命中最重要的事。
