第十一课——路加福音第7和19章部分章节
The Synoptic Gospels – Course B – Luke
福音书-课程B-路加福音
Lesson 11 – Luke, portions of chapters 7 & 19
第十一课-路加福音，7和19章部分章节

Getting Started     Jesus had healed the blind man just outside the city of Jericho while on his way to Jerusalem for the last time. The incident involving Zacchaeus takes place after Jesus entered the city of Jericho, about 20 km northeast of Jerusalem. The Parable of the Ten Minas, which follows the story of Zacchaeus, is so similar to the Parable of the Talents that we will not discuss it. We will, however, take note of the words that introduce this parable. We then return to an incident not covered so far in this study – the anointing of Jesus by the sinful woman in Luke 7. This story fits well with the story of Zacchaeus, because both incidents emphasize the central theme of Luke’s gospel. This ends “Course B” of the synoptic gospels. “Course C” will include the study of the events of Holy Week through the Ascension from all four gospels.
入题:      在最后一次去耶路撒冷时，耶稣在耶利哥城外医治了一个瞎子。撒该的故事发生在耶稣进入位于耶路撒冷东北的耶利哥城之后发生的。十锭银子的比喻发生在撒该的故事之后。这个比喻跟恩赐的比喻很相像。我们在这里不讨论恩赐的比喻，但会看一下对这个比喻的介绍，然后再转过来看一个本课没提到过的事件-路加福音七章中有罪妇人膏抹耶稣。这个故事跟撒该的故事相吻合，因为两者都强调了路加福音的主题。福音书课程B就此结束。课程C将包括四福音书有关      耶稣受难前一周的事件直到升天。
Luke 19:1-11 Jesus and Zacchaeus the Tax Collector 7:36-50
路加福音19:1-11 耶稣和税吏撒该 7:36-50
1.What information about Zacchaeus does Luke include which shows us why honest Jewish citizens would have despised him?
1.从路加提到的关于撒该的信息看，为什么正直的犹太人会看不起他？

2.Make a list of the other times Jesus talked about wealth from chapter 14 onwards. What does this show us about Jesus’ concern? What lessons does this teach us?
2、列出从14章开始耶稣对财富问题的谈论。我们从中看出耶稣在担心什么事？这对 我们有什么教训？

3.What encouragement do we find in the fact that Jesus invited himself into Zacchaeus home? (Jesus was crossing social barriers in doing so, for most Jews considered tax collectors to be “traitors” and would never socialize with them.)
3. 耶稣自己提出去撒该家做客的事对我们有怎样的鼓励？（耶稣这样做越过了很多社会障碍，因为当时的犹太人把税吏看做叛徒，并且从不跟他们来往）

4.It is interesting to note that in verse 7 a rather large group of people is observing Jesus’ actions in a critical way. What does this show us about the sinful human nature?
4. 有趣的是，第七节中有一大群人在以批评的眼光观察耶稣的行动。这让我们看到有关人的罪性的哪些方面？

5.How does Zacchaeus’ demonstration of his new-found faith become a model for wealthy believers today?
5.撒该新获得信心后的表现为今天富足的信徒树立了怎样的榜样？

6.Use Galatians 3:7 to explain what Jesus means by calling Zacchaeus a “son of Abraham.”
6.用加拉太书3:7解释，耶稣把撒该称为亚伯拉罕子孙所包含的意思。

7.How do Jesus’ words in verses 9-10 help to emphasize the purpose of Luke’s gospel? The purpose of our lives?
7.耶稣在9-10节中的话如何强调了路加福音的写作目的？以及我们人生的目的？

8.What does verse 11 indicate that people were thinking and saying about Jesus at this point?
8.从11节看出，人们此时是如何看待和议论耶稣的？

Luke 7:36-50 A Sinful Woman Anoints Jesus
路加福音7:36-50 有罪的妇人膏抹耶稣
[Note: In verse 36 reclining at the table refers to the Roman custom of leaning against the cushions of a dining couch with the feet extended away from the table. In verse 37 it appears that the host was paying little attention to the arrival of guests, since a woman with a bad reputation is allowed to come into the party and give her attention to one of the guests. This lack of attention to guests comes out further in Jesus’ words to the Pharisee later in the account. According to the customs of the day (i.e., washing guests’ feet when they arrived), the woman’s act in verse 38 would not have appeared to be as unusual to them as it may appear to us. The woman is not identified, even though many have assumed it was Mary of Magdala. We should be certain not to confuse this story with the anointing by Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus, which takes place in John 12.]
[注意：36节中提到的“坐席”（靠在桌子上）指的是当时的罗马习俗，人靠着长椅子的靠垫而坐，脚伸到桌子以外。从第37节我们看到，主人似乎并不在意来的客人是什么人，因为有一个名声不好的妇人也来了，并且在众多的客人中特别提到她。从后来耶稣对法利赛人说话的记述中也可以看到，主人对来到的客人没有要求。根据当时的习俗（即客人到来时为客人洗脚），第38节中妇人所做的对当时的人来说，就不像对于我们今天的人这样觉得奇怪了。那个妇人的身份没有详细说明，虽然很多人认为那就是抹大拉的玛利亚。我们一定不要把这个故事跟约翰福音12章中马大和拉撒路的姐妹玛利亚膏抹耶稣的故事混淆]

9.How many similarities are there between this incident and the healing of the paralyzed man in Luke 5:17-26?
9.这件事与路加福音5:17-26中对瘫子的医治有多少个相似之处？

10.What was the woman showing by her actions in verse 38?
10.第38节中那个妇人的行动是为了表达什么？

11.What do the words of the Pharisee in verse 39 show about the woman? about the Pharisee?
11.第39节中法利赛人的话说明这个妇人是怎样的人？法利赛人是怎样的人？

12.What is the point of Jesus’ story about the men who owed money?
12.耶稣提到那个欠债人的故事是为了说明什么？

13.What did the contrasting actions between the woman and the Pharisee show?
13.妇人跟法利赛人行为的鲜明对比说明了什么？

14.Forgiveness of a person’s sins comes before that person’s love for Christ. How do Jesus’ words show that?
14.人先是罪得到赦免才会有爱神的心。如何从耶稣的话中看到这一点？

15.How does this story also fit into the purpose of Luke’s gospel? Why do we find in it so much personal comfort?
15.这个故事怎样与路加福音的主题相吻合？我们为什么可以从其中得到很多个人的安慰？
