Matthew
马太
WHEN AND WHERE WRITTEN?
写作时间和写作地点？
We do not know exactly when Matthew wrote his Gospel. He evidently wrote quite some time after Jesus' death and rising. This is assumed because he uses the expressions "to this day" and "to this very day" in telling of passion events and resurrection events. Those expressions suggest that some years had passed before Matthew wrote his Gospel. But Matthew evidently wrote before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 A.D. He makes no mention of that destruction, even though his chapter 24 prophesies it. If we want to guess when Matthew wrote his Gospel, perhaps we could say sometime in the 60s A.D. We do not know where Matthew was when he wrote his Gospel. Some early church fathers assumed he wrote from Judea; other scholars say Antioch in Syria; still others have mentioned Egypt. We do not know.
我们无法确切知道马太何时写的福音书。但他显然是在耶稣受难和升天之后写的。这样认为是因为他在讲述耶稣受难和复活事件后用“直到今日”的说法。这些表达说明马太写此福音书前，已过了些年日。但马太写书时间明显是在公元70年耶路撒冷被罗马毁灭之前。即使他在太24章预言到此事，却没有提及沦陷的事实。如果我们想猜测马太福音成书时间，也许可以说是在公元60-70年。我们不清楚马太在何时何处写的福音书。一些早期教父认为他在犹太地写的；另一些学者认为在叙利亚的安提阿；甚至还有一些提到在埃及。我们不得而知。
WRITTEN FIRST TO WHOM
最初的写作对象
It is evident from Matthew's Gospel that he was writing originally for Jewish readers. We say this for the following reasons: 1) Matthew is very careful to point out that the New Testament events he describes are a fulfilling of the Old Testament. Jews, who knew the Old Testament well would especially be interested in hearing this. 2) Matthew is especially interested in showing that Jesus is indeed the Messiah that the Old Testament had prophesied. Jewish readers would have to identify Jesus with the Messiah if they were to put their faith in him. (See [Mat. 1:1] to see how Matthew immediately connects Jesus with Old Testament messianic prophesies.) 3) Matthew mentions Jewish laws, customs, and locations without explaining them to his readers. Jewish readers would know these things already. Gentiles would need explanations. More than the other Gospels, Matthew serves to connect the Old Testament with the New Testament. He says that the Old Testament is fulfilled in Jesus' words and works. He says that Jesus is the Messiah that the Old Testament long prophesied. Of course the other Gospels say this too. But Matthew very much stresses the connection between the Old and New Testaments. It is fitting that Matthew's book should come immediately after that of Malachi. Matthew joined the two Testaments beautifully for the original Jewish readers and for readers of all nationalities today.
从马太的福音书来看，显而易见他最初是为犹太人而写。我们这样说有以下几个原因：1）马太非常仔细地指出他所记录的新约事件是对旧约的应验。犹太人，熟知旧约，将尤其有兴趣听到这些。2）马太特别旨在说明耶稣确实是旧约预言的弥赛亚。如果犹太人相信他的话，他们会认同耶稣就是弥赛亚。（参看[太：1:1] 看马太如何直接把耶稣和旧约弥赛亚式的预言联系起来。）3）马太提及犹太律法，习俗，地理位置时没向读者加以解释。犹太的读者已经知道这些事。但外邦人则需要解释。比起其他福音书，马太更紧密联合旧约与新约。他说旧约应验在耶稣的言行中。他说耶稣就是旧约预言已久的弥赛亚。当然其他福音书也证实这点。但马太极其强调新旧约之间的关连。让马太福音紧接玛拉基书之后是最合适不过了。马太为最初的犹太读者和今天全世界的读者完美地连接了两约。
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MATTHEW
马太福音的特色
1.     He shows Jesus to be the Messiah and King. 2. He shows Christianity to be the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. 3. He relates long discourses or sermons of Jesus, while the other Gospel writers tended to relate shorter sections of what Jesus said. (As examples, note "The Sermon on the Mount" where Jesus speaks for three whole chapters in Mat. 5-7. Note also chap. 10 when Jesus sends out the Twelve. Note the parables all grouped together in chap. 13.) 4. He emphasizes "The Kingdom of Heaven," an expression that he uses 32 times. 5. There are a number of accounts and parables of Jesus that only Matthew relates. Some Bible handbooks and commentaries have lists of these things found only in Matthew.
1.他证明耶稣是弥赛亚和君王。2.他显示基督教是对旧约预言的应验。3.他详尽记录耶稣的教训和讲道，而其他福音书则趋于记录耶稣较短的教导。（比如，注意马太福音第5-7章整整三章记录耶稣的“登山宝训”。还有第10章记录耶稣差派12门徒的训勉。再有耶稣所用的比喻都集中在第13章。）4.他强调“天国”，这一表达他使用了32次。5. 有很多关于耶稣的记录和比喻只有马太福音提供。一些圣经手册和评论列举了这些仅在马太福音提供的内容。
Mark
马可
WHEN AND WHERE WAS THE GOSPEL WRITTEN?
该福音书写于何时何处？
Many scholars think that Mark's gospel was the first Gospel to be written. They think that Matthew and Luke may have used Mark's Gospel as their outline. About 95 percent of what Mark writes can be found in Matthew and Luke; this seems to indicate that Mark's Gospel may have come first. If Matthew wrote his Gospel in the 60s A.D., then perhaps Mark wrote his Gospel sometime in the 50s A.D. We have no way of knowing for sure just when any of the Gospels were written; and obviously the date of writing is not important for our faith. Christian tradition says that Mark wrote his Gospel from Rome. In [1 Peter 5:13] Peter indicates that John Mark was indeed in Rome, called "Babylon" in this verse. He may well have written his Gospel when in Rome.
很多学者认为马可福音是最早写成的福音书。他们认为马太和路加可能使用马可福音作为他们著书的轮廓。马可福音中约有95%的内容能在马太福音和路加福音中找到，这似乎暗示马可的福音书最先成书。如果马太福音写于公元60-70 年，那马可福音可能写于公元50-60年。我们无法确切知道任何一卷福音书由何时所写；显然这著书时间对我们的信仰并不重要。根据基督教的传统说法，马可是在罗马写此福音书。在[彼得前书5:13] 彼得指出马可的确是在罗马，在此节中被称之为“巴比伦”。他很可能是在罗马写成这卷福音书。

TO WHOM WAS MARK'S GOSPEL FIRST WRITTEN?
马可福音最初的写作对象？
From the contents of Mark's Gospel, it seems certain that he was writing originally for Gentile readers, specifically for Roman Gentiles. We can make this assumption for a number of reasons: 1) Mark uses 10 Latin words in his Gospel that would easily be understood by Romans but perhaps not by Jews. 2) He translates Aramaic expressions for his readers; Jews would understand them without translation (see 3:17; 5:41; 7:34; 14:36; 15:34). 3) He explains Jewish customs and beliefs which would not be understood by Gentiles (see 7:2-3; 14:12; 15:6; 15:42; 12:18). When we put these thoughts together with the tradition that Mark wrote his Gospel from Rome, it makes good sense to say that he was writing for Roman Gentiles.
从马可的福音书的内容来看，似乎可以确定他最初是为外邦人而写，尤其是罗马的外邦人。我们的设想基于以下原因：1） 马可在他的福音书里使用了10个拉丁词，这些词很容易被罗马人理解，但犹太人可能不行。2）他为读者翻译亚兰语；犹太人是不需要翻译的（参看3:17,5:41,7:34；14:36；15:34）3）他解释了犹太人的习俗和信仰，这些外邦人并不了解（参看7:2-3,14:12,15:6,15:42；12:18） 。当我们把以上观点和马可在罗马写福音书的习俗结合起来，说此书是写给罗马的外邦人看就很好理解了。
SOME SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MARK'S GOSPEL
马可福音的特色
1. Mark's Gospel is the shortest of the Four Gospels. 2. It is "the Gospel of action" instead of a Gospel with long spoken sections like Matthew's Gospel. Expressions like "at once," "immediately," "suddenly," or "just as he was speaking" serve to keep the action moving along. He does not tell of Jesus' birth but prefers to get quickly into the action of Jesus' works. 3 .Mark's Gospel stresses the miracles of Jesus, and thereby shows Jesus to be the powerful son of God. Mark relates 18 miracles of Jesus, but tells only four of His parables.
1. 马可的福音书是四部福音书里最短的一卷书。2.它是一本“行动的福音”而不是一本像马太的福音书那样带有很长篇幅的言论的福音书。类似“立即”“马上”“突然”或“正当他说的时候”的字眼表达行动之迅速。他没有提及耶稣的出生，更倾向直接记述耶稣的事工。3.马可福音强调耶稣所行的神迹，从而显示耶稣是具有大能的神子。马可记录了耶稣的18件神迹，但仅记述了耶稣讲道中的四个比喻。

Luke
路加
WHEN, WHERE, AND TO WHOM WRITTEN?
写作时间，地点，写作对象？
Luke probably wrote before 70 A.D., since he does not mention the actual fall of Jerusalem in that year but does prophesy it in his 21st chapter. He probably wrote his Gospel after Matthew and Mark, as the words in his introduction in 1:1-4 show. Sometime in the 60s A.D. might be a reasonable guess for when Luke wrote his Gospel. Many scholars think that Luke wrote his Gospel from the city of Rome, since Luke was staying with Paul while Paul was in prison in Rome. Other guesses have been Greece and Caesarea. From Luke's introduction we know the first person for whom his Gospel was written - Theophilus. This man is called "most excellent," a title showing that he was in a high position. He was probably a Gentile who was converted to Christianity sometime before Luke addressed his Gospel to him. It is commonly understood that Luke's Gospel was intended first for Gentiles.
路加可能是公元70年前写的福音书，因为他没有提及那年耶城沦陷的事实，而是确实在第21章预言了耶路撒冷的沦陷。他大概是继马太和马可之后写的福音书，正如在路：1:1-4节引言所示。公元60-70年为路加写书时间可能是个合理的猜测。许多学者认为，既然路加当时和保罗同工，直到保罗入狱，因此，路加应该是在罗马著书。其他猜测是在希腊和凯撒利亚。从路加的引言，我们获悉他的福音书是特为一个人而写——提阿非罗。此人被称为“大人”，这个头衔显示他是名政要。他可能是在路加向他受书之前，已皈依基督教的外邦人。所以，普遍认为路加的福音书最初打算为外邦人而写。
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LUKE'S GOSPEL
路加福音的特色
1.     Luke stresses the theme that Christ and his Gospel are for all people. His genealogy in chapter 3 traces Jesus all the way back to Adam, the father of all nations. (Compare Matthew's genealogy.) He dates Jesus' life according to things in world history and not just Jewish history (2:1; 3:1-2). Special references are made in Luke relating to the Gentiles (2:32; 3:6; 4:25-27; 14:15-24). 2. Luke has the longest and most detailed account of Jesus' Nativity. 3. Luke often presents Jesus as one who prays, suggesting the importance of prayer in the life of Christians (3:21; 5:16; 6:12; 9:18; 11:1; 22:39-46 23:34 & 36 and others). 4. Luke gives special consideration to women in his Gospel (1:26-56; 7:11-17; 8:1-3; 8:43-48; 10:38-42; 13:16: 23:28 and others).
路加强调的主题是基督和他的福音是为所有人类。在第3章耶稣的家谱一直追溯到亚当，全人类之父。（比较马太福音中的家谱）。他是依照世界历史而不是犹太人历史来追溯耶稣生平事迹。（2:1；3:1-2）。路加福音中专门提到外邦人的章节有（2:32,3:6,4;25-27;14：15-24）。2. 路加福音以最长篇幅详尽记录耶稣的诞生。3. 路加福音笔下的耶稣常常是位祷告者，说明祷告在基督徒生活中的重要性。（3:21；5:16；6:12,9:18；11;1,22:39-46;23：34和36节等）4.路加在他的福音书中对妇女予以特别关注。（(1:26-56; 7:11-17; 8:1-3; 8:43-48; 10:38-42; 13:16: 23:28节等).
