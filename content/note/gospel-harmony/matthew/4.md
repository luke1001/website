Matthew’s Gospel – Introduction

马太福音——引言

For review:  In Lesson 2 we studied the background of each of the synoptic authors.  The following is a brief summary of what we learned about Matthew:

回顾：在第二课我们学习了符类福音每卷书的作者背景。以下列出的是我们学过的关于“马太”的一个摘要。

V      His name, “Matthew,” is a Hebrew name meaning “gift from the Lord.”

“马太”是希伯来文名字，意思是“从上帝来的礼物”

V      He is called by his other name, Levi, in the gospels of Mark and Luke.

在马可与路加福音中，他被称为“利未”。

V      He was a tax collector by profession, and he left that profession when Jesus called him to full-time apostleship.

他的职业是税吏，耶稣呼召他，他就离开当税吏的职业，成为全职的使徒。

V      He shared his relationship with Jesus by inviting his friends to a party in Jesus’ honor shortly after he was called to be an apostle.

当耶稣呼召他为门徒之后不久，他邀请了自己的朋友与尊荣的耶稣一同坐席，以此见证他与耶稣的关系。

Matthew 1:1-17

马太福音1：1－17

1\. Why does Matthew begin his gospel by saying that Jesus Christ is the son of David, the son of Abraham?

为什么马太福音始于耶稣基督是大卫的子孙，亚伯拉罕的子孙呢？

2\. We read that Perez, Zerah, and Rahab are in the family tree of Jesus.  References to these persons are found in Genesis 38 and Joshua 2:1 and 6:25.  When you consider their background, why is it a little surprising that they are in Jesus’ family tree?  Why is it also a comfort for us that they are included?

我们看到法勒斯、谢拉与喇合出现在耶稣家谱中。参考经文创世纪38章，约书亚记2：1，6：25 。当你结合这些背景资料思考的时候，为什么他们出现在耶稣的家谱中有些出人意料？为什么他们包含在家谱中对我们来说也是一个安慰？


3\. Why does Matthew present Jesus’ family tree through Joseph?

为什么马太福音列出的是约瑟（男方）的家谱？



Matthew 1:18-25

马太福音1：18－25

4\. What do verses 18-19 show us about Jewish marriage customs at the time of Mary and Joseph?  (Consider the phrases pledged to be married, before they came together, Joseph her husband, divorce her quietly.)

太1：18－19节向我们表明在马利亚与约瑟的那个时代，犹太人的婚姻传统是什么？（结合经文思考他们订婚了，在他们结婚之前，他的丈夫约瑟想要暗暗的把她休了。）

5\.      Why would the name of Mary’s baby be so significant?

为什么马利亚婴孩的名字将寓意深刻？



6\.      In what ways is the Isaiah quote in verse 23 a personal comfort to your faith?

太1：23引用了以赛亚先知的话，这段话以怎样的方式给你的信仰带来安慰？


7\.      In how many ways does Joseph show himself to be a God-fearing man in these verses? (List them.)

在这些经文中，在那些方面约瑟表明自己是一个敬畏神的人？（列出它们）


Matthew 2:1-12

马太福音2：1-12

8\.      Explain who these “wise men” were, why they came to Jerusalem, and how they came to believe in the God of Israel. (Consider Daniel, chapter 1.)

解释谁是那些“博士”，他们为什么要来耶路撒冷，他们是怎么相信以色列的上帝的。（参考但以理书第一章）


9\.      History tells us about King Herod the Great:

从历史中了解大希律

[Herod] was also cruel, merciless, and jealous. He had his wife’s brother, Aristobulus the high priest, drowned and then pretended to mourn at the magnificent funeral he provided. He had his own wife Mariamne killed, as well as her mother and three of his sons. Shortly before his death, he had the most distinguished citizens of Jerusalem imprisoned and then gave orders that they should be executed at the moment of his own death. In that way he wanted to ensure that there would be mourning in the city at the time of his death, for he knew that otherwise there might be only rejoicing among the citizenry.

[大希律]同样是一个残暴，残忍和嫉妒的人。 他妻子的兄弟亚里斯托布鲁斯（Aristobulus）是大祭司，大希律在住棚节的时候淹死了他，然后假装悲伤为其举行了隆重的葬礼。他杀死自己的妻子玛利安妮，以及玛利安妮的母亲，并他与玛利安妮的三个儿子。不久他身患恶疾，临死前，他监禁了一批耶路撒冷的犹太领袖并预先下令，在他死的那一刻，要把他们同时处死，目的是确保城中百姓在他死时哀声震天，因为他知道除此之外或许民众只会庆贺。

Why would Herod feel threatened by the wise men’s question?

为什么希律对博士的问话感到心里不安？


10\. Some people claim that this special “star” was merely the planets Jupiter, Mars, and Venus lined up in space so as to create a very bright-looking object in the sky.  (This does happen occasionally.)  How do we know that this star was a special star placed into the sky by God?

有人声称那颗新“星”，不过是宇宙中的木星、火星和金星排成一行，所以在天空中出现了一颗看起来特别亮的星（这是偶尔会发生的）。我们怎样认识天空中这颗新星是上帝的作为呢？

11\. How do these verses show us that the wise men were not present at the stable where Jesus was born?

这几节的经文是怎样向我们表明当耶稣出生的时候，博士们不在现场？

12\. What is the meaning of the passage from Micah 5:2 that is quoted in verse 6?

太2：6节引用弥迦书5：2经文的有什么含义？


13\. What do the wise men’s gifts show us about the Christ child?

博士们带给婴孩耶稣的礼物向我们表明了什么？


14\. In what ways would it be good for us to imitate the wise men?

我们如何效法博士们？


Matthew 2:13-23

马太福音2：13－23

15\. Why did God tell Joseph to take Mary and Jesus to Egypt?

为什么上帝告诉约瑟要带着马利与耶稣去埃及？


16\. The slaughter of “the innocents” (the babies of Bethlehem) was indeed a tragedy.  Matthew quotes a passage from Jeremiah that has to do with Ramah, the place where the Jews were forced to gather on their way to their captivity in Babylon.  Rachel, the wife of Jacob (Israel) becomes a representative for mothers who have suffered the loss of children.

“无辜的”屠杀（伯利恒城里的婴孩）确实是一个悲剧。马太引用耶利米书31：15节关于拉玛的预言，拉玛是被掳去巴比伦的犹太人的集结地。拉结是雅各（以色列）的妻子，她成为失去孩子的母亲们的一个典型。

Why is the quote from Jeremiah appropriate?

为什么说这里引用耶利米书的话是比较确切的？

Can you think of any similar tragic losses that have taken place throughout history?

你能想起历史中发生的一些失丧亲人的类似悲剧吗？

17\. What two things did Joseph’s move to Nazareth accomplish?

约瑟往拿撒勒去居住应验了哪两样事情？

18\. What are the most important truths you want to remember from these chapters?

从这几章中，你想要记住的最重要的真理是什么？
