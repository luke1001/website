John the Baptist’s Work, Finding Rest in the King’s Work

施洗约翰的事工，在君王的事工中寻找安息

Getting Started:   Matthew continues the topic of Working in the Kingdom by giving attention to Jesus’ words about John’s work. At the end of the chapter, Jesus’ words about finding rest in Him not only release us from the burden of sin, but they also energize us to serve him with increased faithfulness.

课程开始：马太福音透过耶稣的言语继续讲“天国的事工”，是关于施洗约翰的工作的。在这一章的结尾，耶稣讲到关乎在他里面寻找安息，不仅仅是释放我们脱去罪的重担，而且也是增强了我们服侍他的信心。

A.   The Ministry of John the Baptist Mt 11:1-19

施洗约翰的服侍           马太福音11：1－19

1\. How was John like Elijah in a positive way? in a negative way?

施洗约翰如何像以利亚一样采用积极的方式？或消极的方式？

2\. What can we learn about ministry from what John was going through? from Jesus’ description of him?  

我们能从施洗约翰的服侍中学到什么？从耶稣形容他的话语中呢？

3\. Martin Luther’s interpretation of “he who is least in the kingdom” is that it refers to Christ.   Others say that it refers to the humble, faithful believer. Explain how each can be a proper interpretation.

马丁·路德关于“他是天国中最小的”的诠释指向基督。另一说法是指向谦卑、忠信的人。怎样解释才比较合理？

Christ – 基督

The humble believer – 谦卑、忠信者

4\. Concerning the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing (v. 12), Luther wrote, “Men whose consciences have been aroused, when they hear the gospel, press upon it, so that they cannot be stopped.” [1] Explain Luther’s interpretation of this verse in your own words.

关于“天国是努力进入的”（12节），路德曾写到，“当人们听到福音的时候，唤醒了他们的良心，他们努力的争取，以至于不能停止下来”用你自己的话阐述路德对这段经文的解释。

5\. Verse 17 talks about people who want religious leaders to “dance to their tune.” Explain.

17节谈到人们希望宗教领袖“按着他们的曲调跳舞”。解释其涵义。


6\.   Wisdom is proved right by her actions means that Christ, the wisdom of God, would do things that would prove his message was right. How can we apply these words to our own ministry?

“智慧之子，总以智慧为事”的意思是指基督，上帝的智慧，将以行动证明他的信息是正确的。我们怎样能将这些话语应用在我们自己的服侍里呢？



B. Rest in the King When the Work is a Burden    Mt 11:20-30

当工作成为重担的时候在主里面享受安息     马太福音11：20－30

7\.   The prophet Ezekiel and some of the minor prophets speak of Tyre (Phoenician coastal city northwest of Galilee) as an enemy of God’s people, although King Hiram of Tyre helped provide wood for Solomon’s temple. Sodom’s wickedness is well known. Korazin and Bethsaida were near Capernaum, the headquarters of Jesus’ ministry. In your own words, what is the point Jesus is making about these Galilean villages?

以西结先知以及一些年轻的先知都把推罗（加利利西北部的一个海岸城市）看作是上帝子民的敌人，尽管推罗王希兰曾经帮助所罗门建殿提供了木料。众所周知所多玛罪恶滔天。哥拉汛与伯赛大离迦百农很近，迦百农是耶稣事工的总指挥部。用你自己的话来描述耶稣对于加利利这些村庄主要想说些什么。

8\. How can we apply this truth to God’s people today?

我们今天应该怎样把这个真理应用在神的子民中间？

9\. Use 1 Corinthians 1 and Psalm 8:2 to explain the meaning of Matthew 11:25-27.

用哥林多前书第一章与诗篇8：2来解释马太福音11：25－27的涵义。

10\. In verse 28 the verb for give rest means “to provide a pause from work” or “to refresh.” It does not mean “stop working.” What insight does this give you for gospel ministry?

11：28节的动词“休息”意思是“暂停工作”，或者“休息一会”,这并不是说“停止工作”。这段经文对我们传福音的事工有怎样的启示？

11、. What burden do we bear as believers, and what does the yoke picture tell us about our walk of faith?

我们作为信徒要忍受的重担是什么，轭的画面告诉我们关于信心的功课如何？
