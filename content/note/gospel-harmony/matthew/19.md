Getting Started: Jesus ends the confrontation with his enemies. He wants to spend some private time with his disciples on the Mount of Olives. His death is just days away. There are many things to emphasize to them. As they are leaving the temple grounds, the disciples comment on the temple’s beauty. Jesus uses this as an opportunity to lead into a major theme of his final teaching sessions with his disciples. He speaks predictions of “the end.” He tells parables of “the end.” His teaching ministry was nearly over, and his “end” was coming soon. The lessons learned by disciples then and now are vital.

课程开始：   耶稣结束了与敌人的对抗。他要与他的门徒在橄榄山上作私下的嘱咐。离他的死亡只有几天时间了。有很多重要的事情他要向门徒强调。当他们离开圣殿的时候，门徒们评论圣殿的华丽。耶稣借此机会带领门徒进入最后一个教训他们的主要题材。他预言了“末日”。他讲论了“末日”的比喻。他教导的事工几乎已经结束了，他的“末日”正在来临。门徒在那时学习的功课现在进入了关键时刻。

24:1-14 The Signs Say, “The End Is Coming”

太24：1－14节，“末日来临”的预兆

Interesting facts: This was the temple of Herod the Great, under construction from 20 B.C. to 65 A.D. It was finished for only five years when the Roman General Titus leveled it along with the rest of the city. Archaeologists have discovered that the temple’s stones were a brilliant white, and some were as large as 10x6x4 meters. The Mount of Olives was located across the Kidron Valley to the east, from which one had a breath-taking view of the temple.

有趣的是：（如图）这是大希律时期的圣殿，公元前20年－公元后65年一直在建，圣殿修好只有5年时间，罗马的将军提多就将这座圣殿连同这座城市夷为平地。考古学家发现圣殿的石头是乳白色的，有些石头有10 x 6 x 4米（240立方米）那么大。橄榄山位于圣殿的东部，横跨汲沦谷，从那个角度看圣殿有着惊人之美。

24:15-25 “The Abomination” and Mixed Pictures

24：15－25“可憎的事”与掺杂的写照

4\. The following comments from The People’s Bible help us understand the phrase the abomination that causes desolation:

接下来的注释来自于《大众圣经》，这能帮助我们很好的理解那造成荒凉的可憎者这个短语的涵义。

There are at least three passages in the book of Daniel that Jesus seems to have in mind: Daniel 9:27, 11:31, and 12:11. It seems that a preliminary fulfillment of this prophecy occurred in 168 b.c. when Antiochus IV (“Epiphanes”) set up an altar to the pagan god Zeus Olympius in the temple at Jerusalem. Some claim that he also ordered the slaughter of a pig in the Most Holy Place. Now Jesus says that Daniel’s prophecy also points to a similar desecration of the temple that will precede the destruction of Jerusalem. Some commentators think this happened when the Roman emperor Caligula tried to have a statue of himself set up in the temple—an order that fortunately was never carried out. There seems to be a connection between Jesus’ words here and his prediction, “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near” (Luke 21:20). This happened when Titus and his Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem in a.d. 70. And so her house was left desolate (see Matthew 23:38).

在耶稣心里起码有三段但以理书内的预言，那就是：《但以理书》9：27，11：31；12：11。看起来这预言初步的应验是在公元前168年。当安条克四世（伊皮法尼斯）在耶路撒冷圣殿中设立了异教宙斯·奥林匹斯的祭坛时，有人声称他也下令在至圣所屠杀一头猪。现在耶稣说，但以理先知的预言也同样指向了发生在耶路撒冷城被毁前亵渎神圣的事情。有些圣经评论家认为，当罗马皇帝卡里古拉曾经计划将自己的雕像放在圣殿中这样的事就发生了，幸亏这个命令没有得到执行。这些似乎都与耶稣在这里所说的话以及他的预言有着关联。“当你们看见耶路撒冷被兵围困时、就可知道它成荒场的日子近了。”（路加福音21：20）。这发生在提多以及他的罗马军团在公元70年摧毁耶路撒冷时。所以她的家成了荒场（参太23：38）。

The destruction of Jerusalem in a.d. 70, however, did not exhaust Daniel’s prophecy. Like this chapter of Matthew’s gospel, Daniel pointed both to the fall of the city and to the Last Day. Both the city of Jerusalem and the temple are prophetic pictures of the church. And just as the abomination that causes desolation was set up in the temple, so the Antichrist “sets himself up in God’s temple” (2 Thessalonians 2:4).[1]

然而，公元70年耶路撒冷城被毁，并非但以理预言的全部。如马太福音这章的内容，但以理同时指向圣城的被毁以及“末日”。耶路撒冷这座城市与圣殿是先知预言教会的写照。正如促使圣殿遭到遗弃的可憎之事立于圣殿之中，敌基督者也“在耶和华的圣殿放置自己的雕像”（《帖撒罗尼迦后书》2：4）

What is the warning for Christians today concerning this “abomination”?

这些“可憎的事”对今天的基督徒有什么警告？

5\. Which parts of verses 16-25 could be applied to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.? Which parts apply only to the end of the world and Christ’s return?

太24：16－25节哪一部分适用于耶路撒冷城于公元70年被毁？哪一部分只适用于末日基督的再来？

6\. Why does Jesus tell us these things?

耶稣为什么告诉我们这些事呢？

24:26-44 The Son of Man’s Return

太24：26-44人子的再来

7\. What point is Jesus making in verses 27 and 28?
太24：27与28节耶稣的主旨是什么？
8. Compare verse 29 to Luke 21:25-26. What do you see happening right before Christ’s return?

对照太24：29节与《路加福音》21：25－26节。在基督再来之前，你看见什么？

9\. Some people think verses 40-41 are speaking of “the rapture” (Jesus’ “secret” return to pull believers out of this world before things get really bad in “the Great Tribulation”). List things from these verses which prove this entire section is about Christ’s final return, not a “rapture.”

有人认为太24：40－41节是说到“被提”（在真正的“大灾难”来临之前，耶稣“秘密”的回来将基督徒接走）。从这些经文中列出能够证明全部章节都是关于基督再来，而不是指“被提”。

10\. Which verse states what Jesus wants us to do with all this information?

哪些经文指出了耶稣想要我们对整个信息做出的行动？
