Challenges to the King’s Work

君王事工的挑战

Getting Started:   Matthew has emphasized the importance of the King’s work by describing the sending out of the Twelve on their temporary mission, by underscoring the importance of John the Baptist’s ministry, and by encouraging his workers to find rest in him alone under his “easy” yoke. Matthew now focuses on the challenges which Jesus faced from his enemies in carrying out his gospel work. The Savior’s words strengthen us as we continue to work for him.

课程开始：《马太福音》已经强调了君王事工派出了十二门徒短暂宣教的重要性，施洗约翰事工的重要性及鼓励他的工人们在主“轻省”的轭下面寻找安息的重要性。《马太福音》接下来聚焦于耶稣在开展他的福音事工上面临着应对仇敌的挑战。当我们继续为主做工时，他的话语为我们加添力量。

C. Jesus and Beelzebub   Matthew 12:22-37

耶稣与别西卜              《马太福音》12：22－37

4\.      Beelzebub is an Old Testament name for the prince of the demons (the devil) meaning either “lord of the flies” or “lord of the dung heap,” an intentional insult to mankind’s greatest enemy. Jesus’ enemies claim that it was Beelzebub’s power that gave Jesus the ability to drive out demons. How does Jesus dismiss their false charge?

别西卜是旧约中魔鬼王子的名字（污鬼），意思是“苍蝇之主”或者“粪堆之王”，是故意侮辱人类最大的敌人而用的。耶稣的仇敌宣称是别西卜的权柄给予了耶稣能力，能赶逐污鬼。耶稣是怎样反驳这些错误的指控的呢？

9\. What is the connection between Jesus’ words in verses 43-45 and his mentioning of the people of Nineveh and the Queen of Sheba (who visited Solomon – 1 Kings 10) in verses 41-42? [Remember Matthew’s purpose – to convince Jews that Jesus is the promised Messiah.]

耶稣在43－45节的话语和祂在41－42节提到的尼尼微的人民与示巴女王（拜访过所罗门《列忘记上》10章）有什么关系？（注意《马太福音》的目的是使犹太人知道耶稣是应许中的弥赛亚。）

Comments from The People’s Bible on Matthew 12:1-14

《大众圣经》关于《马太福音》12：1－14节的注释

“At that time” must have been in the month of April, near Passover time, the year before Jesus’ death, for the grain was ripe and ready to harvest. There was nothing unusual, and nothing wrong with helping oneself to some of the grain, rubbing the kernels out in one’s hands, and eating the grain. The Law of Moses clearly provided for this: “If you enter your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to his standing grain” (Deuteronomy 23:25).

“那时”应指耶稣离世前一年的4月中，靠近逾越节，因为麦穗已成熟准备要收割了。有人摘了谷穗，用手搓搓, 然后吃掉谷粒不过是很平常的事，没什么错。摩西律法明显提到，“你进了邻舍站着的禾稼，可以用手摘穗子，只是不可用镰刀割取禾稼。”（《申命记》23：25）

The Pharisees knew better than to make an issue of the disciples’ actions in themselves, but they pretended to be horrified that Jesus would let his disciples do this on the Sabbath Day. It is true that the Sabbath was to be a day of rest. No unnecessary work was to be done on the Sabbath, and the Law of Moses clearly pointed out many kinds of labor that were to be avoided on the Sabbath. But the Law of Moses did not condemn what the disciples were doing. The legalistic Pharisees, who had formulated many more regulations of their own, classified the disciples’ deeds as unlawful harvesting and threshing of grain. They were delighted to find another excuse for criticizing Jesus and his disciples.

尽管法利赛人知道更好的是去指责门徒们的行动，但是他们仍然假装震惊于耶稣让门徒在安息日这样做。安息日确实是安歇的日子。在安息日不做没有必要的工作，摩西律法明确规定在安息日禁止许多劳作。但是摩西律法并没有对门徒的行为判罪。墨守成规的法利赛人，人为地制定出更多的律法规条，将门徒们手摘穗子磨出了谷粒的行为列为违法。他们乐于找到了指责耶稣和门徒的又一个借口。

Once again, however, Jesus had no difficulty in refuting the charge of the Pharisees. He did not even bother to remind them that the disciples had not broken a God-given law, but only a man-made regulation that really had no validity. He responded on a higher level, pointing out that the law of love might at times violate ceremonial laws without being guilty of sin. As a matter of fact, there are times when it would be wrong not to violate the letter of some ceremonial laws. Jesus proceeded to give them two examples.

然而，耶稣毫无困难地再次驳斥了法利赛人的指控。他甚至毋庸提及门徒没有违反上帝的律法，只是违背了不合理的人为规条。耶稣是从更高的层面来回应，他指出爱的诫命，尽管有时侵犯了礼仪之法, 却是无罪的。实际上，严格遵守礼仪条文的一笔一划，有的时候反而是错误的。耶稣接下来给他们举了两个例子。

First he reminded them of an incident recorded in 1 Samuel chapter 21. At a time when David and his soldiers were being pursued by King Saul, who wanted to kill David, God’s priest, Ahimelech, gave David and his companions consecrated bread that, according to the ceremonial law, was to be eaten only by the priests. This was an emergency, and Ahimelech did not hesitate to make an exception to the usual order of things. And no one charged David and his companions or Ahimelech the priest with committing sin in this situation. So it was ridiculous to condemn Jesus’ disciples for something that was not even a violation of the ceremonial laws God had given to Israel through Moses.

首先他提醒法利赛人《撒母耳记》上21章所发生的一件事实。当大卫和跟从他的士兵被扫罗追杀的时候，上帝的祭司亚希米勒给了大卫与他的随从陈设饼吃，根据礼仪之法，陈设饼只能给祭司们吃。这是一个危急的时刻，亚希米勒没有迟疑地做了一件非同寻常的事情。在这种情况下，没有人指责大卫与他的随从或亚希米勒有罪。耶稣的门徒所作的甚至都没有违背上帝藉摩西赐予以色列人的礼仪条文，因此谴责他们是非常荒谬的。

Furthermore, Jesus said, God himself required his priests to do physical labor on the Sabbath. For example, butchering sheep was forbidden labor on the Sabbath, yet God had commanded, “On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect” (Numbers 28:9). No one would accuse the priests at the temple of sinning by offering those sacrifices on the Sabbath.

此外，耶稣说道，上帝要求他的祭司们在安息日劳作。举例来说，本来屠宰羊在安息日是禁止的，但是上帝也命令，“当安息日，要献两只没有残疾，一岁的公羊羔…”（民数记28：9）没有人指责圣殿的祭司在安息日献祭是犯罪的。

The temple was a symbol of God’s presence among his people, and the temple was not desecrated by such labor of the priests on the Sabbath. Jesus was more than a symbol of God’s presence. He was Immanuel, God with us, true God incarnate, and Lord of the Sabbath. He could set aside Sabbath laws if he so desired, and in due time he did just that, but at this time he and his disciples scrupulously obeyed the ceremonial laws. What the disciples did in that grainfield was not a violation in any sense of the word.

圣殿是上帝在他的子民中存在的象征，祭司在圣殿安息日献祭不是对圣殿的亵渎。耶稣不仅是上帝显现的象征，他是以马内利，上帝与人同在，上帝道成肉身，他是安息日的主。如果他愿意他可以将安息日的律法条文放在一边，在适当的时候他真的这样做，然而现在他与他的门徒谨慎地遵守着礼仪的法律。所以门徒们进入禾稼怎么说都不是违法的行为。

The Pharisees’ problem was that they did not understand the divine principle expressed by the prophet Hosea: “I desire mercy, not sacrifice” (Hosea 6:6). Anytime there might be an apparent conflict between the ceremonial laws and human needs, God tells us to do whatever is necessary to be merciful to someone in need.

法利赛人的问题在于他们没有理解何西阿先知所言的神性的原理：“我喜爱良善（或作怜恤），不喜爱祭祀，”（何6：6上）。每当律法与人的行为有冲突的时候，上帝告诉我们对有需要的人要怜恤。

[Note: “Mercy” is the Hebrew word “chesed.” Chesed  is God’s “loving kindness” that moves God to look at the misery of the humanity He loved and to help them. Chesed also moves God to keep his promises to the people with whom He has made a covenant. (Chesed can be translated “covenant love.”)]

[注：“Mercy（怜恤）”希伯来语读音是“Chesed”。Chesed是上帝“爱的仁慈”，牵动着上帝看顾痛苦的人类且帮助他们。Chesed同时也是激起上帝持守他对人类“约”的应许。（Chesed也可以翻译为“立约的爱”）]

Those Pharisees could not respond, but they were not ready to give up in their efforts to criticize and condemn Jesus. Their unbelief was unreasonable, but they refused to learn from Jesus. They rather felt that they had to find a way to silence him, and they would stop at nothing! So they continued to keep an eye on Jesus and to look for more opportunities to discredit him. They had another chance on the following Sabbath Day (see Luke 6:6). Jesus went into their synagogue, and this time they took the initiative. They noticed a man in the congregation who had a shriveled hand, and immediately they correctly surmised that Jesus might heal this man—even on the Sabbath Day. So they asked Jesus, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”

那些法利赛人不能回应，但是他们没有准备放弃批评和指责耶稣。他们的不信是不合情理的，但是他们拒绝向耶稣学习，他们宁愿寻找办法阻止耶稣发言，但他们阻止不了！因此他们继续密切地关注耶稣，寻找机会使耶稣蒙羞。他们在紧接着的下一个安息日找到了机会（参《路加福音》6：6）。耶稣进了会堂，这次他们主动出击，他们都看到有一个人右手枯干了，马上推测耶稣会医治这个人——甚至在安息日。所以他们求问耶稣，“安息日治病，可以不可以？”

Jesus’ response clearly revealed their hypocrisy in asking that question. They would not hesitate to rescue a sheep from a pit on the Sabbath, even though that might require quite a bit of physical labor on their part, and they would not regard that labor as a violation of Sabbath law. A human being is much more valuable than any animal, and Jesus could heal this man’s shriveled hand without doing any physical labor at all. So how could they possibly find fault with him? Jesus then simply told the man to stretch out his hand. He did, and he was healed. Jesus did not even touch him, and Jesus did not even pronounce him healed. Yet, it was obvious that the healing came from Jesus.

耶稣的回应明显地揭露了他们问这个问题的伪善。他们在安息日会毫不犹豫把掉在坑里的羊拉上来，尽管这需要相当程度上的体力劳动（劳作）了，但是他们不认为这类劳作违反了安息日的规定。人比任何的动物都珍贵，况且耶稣医治这个右手枯干的人没有任何的物理上的劳作。所以他们怎么能寻找到耶稣的过失呢？耶稣随后吩咐那个病人伸出手来，他把手一伸，就得了医治。耶稣甚至都没有碰到他，也没有宣告他得医治。然而，很显然这个病人是从耶稣得了医治。

Again the Pharisees were silenced and felt humiliated. Their unreasonable hatred of Jesus continued unabated. As a matter of fact, they became even more vicious. They went out and plotted to put Jesus to death. That was their response to Jesus’ good deed. Those who accused Jesus of being in league with Satan for doing good were themselves under the power of the devil and capable of doing unspeakable evil![1]

法利赛人再一次沉默不语和蒙羞。他们对耶稣不合情理的恼恨丝毫没有减退。实际上，他们变得更加的狠毒。他们出去商议怎么可以除灭耶稣。这就是他们对耶稣行善的反应。那些指责耶稣与撒旦联盟行善的就是那些在邪恶的魔鬼权势下恶事做尽的人。

The Ahimelech/Abiathar “problem”

亚希米勒与亚比亚他“问题”

Mark 2:26

《马可福音》2：26

" . . . {David} went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat . . . "

“（大卫）当亚比亚他作大祭司的时候，怎么进了神的殿，吃了陈设饼，又给跟从他的人吃。这饼除了祭司以外，人都不可吃。”

1 Samuel 21:1-6

《撒母耳记上》21：1－6

"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest . . . so the priest gave him hallowed bread . . . "

大卫到了挪伯祭司亚希米勒那里……祭司就拿圣饼给他……。

Problem:

问题：

Mark quotes Jesus as saying that Abiathar was the high priest, but the account in Samuel to which James refers, says that Ahimelech was the high priest. Therefore, it is argued, one, or both accounts, is in error.

《马可福音》引用耶稣的话说亚比亚他是大祭司，但是根据撒母耳记的记载，亚希米勒是大祭司。因此，这是有争议的，其中一处、或者这两处的记载，肯定弄错了。

Solution:

解决方案：

The apparent inaccuracy is resolved once it is realized that Abiathar and Ahimelech were names of both father and son. This can be seen by a comparison of the following passages: 从

表面上来看一个解决的办法是亚希米勒与亚比亚他是父子的关系，这从以下的经文中可以看出：

1 Samuel 14:3 - "And Ahiah, {mg. called Ahimelech} the son of Ahitub . . . "

《撒母耳记上》14：3“在那里有亚希突的儿子亚希亚（亚希米勒的缩写）……”

1 Samuel 22:20 - "And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."    

《撒母耳记上》22：20“亚希突的儿子亚希米勒有一个儿子，名叫亚比亚他，逃到大卫那里。”

2 Samuel 8:17 - "And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests . . . "

《撒母耳记下》8：17“ 亚希突的儿子撒督和亚比亚他的儿子亚希米勒作祭司长；西莱雅作书记；”

1 Chronicles 18:16; 24:6 - same as 2 Samuel 8:17.

《历代志上》18：16；24：6——同样的如《撒母耳记下》8：17。

Jesus and the account in Samuel refer to Ahimelech (or Abiathar, his other name), the son of Ahitub. There is, therefore, no inaccuracy. Jesus uses one name, and the Samuel account uses the other name, for the same individual. 

耶稣指的是《撒母耳记》所说的亚希米勒（或者亚比亚他，他的另一个名字），是亚希突的儿子。因此，毫无疑问，耶稣使用的一个名字，而《撒母耳记》记载的是另一个名字，事实上他们是同一个人。
