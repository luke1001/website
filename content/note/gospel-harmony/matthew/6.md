Getting Started: Matthew has established The King’s Credentials* by showing us Jesus’ background and by including important events at the beginning of his ministry. Jesus is the son of Abraham, the son of David, the virgin-born promised Son, the newborn King, the object of gentile worship, the Anointed of God, the Serpent-Crusher, the great healer, and the proclaimer of Good News. Having established that beginning, Matthew now turns his attention to Jesus’ teachings. He places the Sermon on the Mount early in his gospel, not because it happened early in Jesus’ ministry, but because it is such an important part of Jesus’ teachings concerning a God-pleasing life. Matthew is more concerned about organizing his work by category (as we might expect from a book keeper) than he is about presenting the events in the order in which they occurred.

入门：《马太福音》通过展示耶稣的背景以祂早期事工的重要事件，已经树立了“君王的凭证”*。耶稣是“亚伯拉罕的子孙，大卫的子孙”、童贞女所生应许中的儿子、新生的君王、受外邦敬拜、由上帝所膏立、打伤古蛇者、伟大的医治者、也是福音的宣讲者。建立在这个起点上，马太现在转向了耶稣的教导。他将登山宝训放在了福音书的前头，不是因为它发生在耶稣的事工的早期，乃是因为这是耶稣教导中一个重要的关于蒙上帝喜悦的生活的部分。马太更关注按类别组织自己的工作（正如我们期望中的书记员一样），超过按事情发生的顺序来排列。

Sermon on the Mount – Introduction

登山宝训——介绍

1\. Is The Sermon on the Mount law or gospel? (Law is what we are to do for God. Gospel is what God has done for us.) Give several examples from the sermon to give support to your answer.

“登山宝训”是律法还是福音呢？（“律法”是我们为上帝做什么，“福音”是上帝为我们做了什么）从宝训中举几个例子来陈述支持你自己的观点。

2\. Someone once said that The Sermon on the Mount is “for believers only.” What do you think that person meant by this statement?

有人曾说“登山宝训”是“只给信徒”的。你认为这种陈述的涵义是什么？

Matthew 5:1-12 The Beatitudes (“statements of blessing”) These statements do not describe how one becomes blessed. They describe the blessings that belong to the believer in Christ.

马太福音5：1－12 八福（“赐福的陈述”）这些陈述没有讲一个人怎样成为蒙福的人，而是陈述了在基督里的信徒所得到的祝福。

3\. (Verses 3-4) The words “poor in spirit” and “those who mourn” describe the same group of people. Who are they? (See Psalm 35:13-18.)

（太5：3－4）“虚心”（灵里贫穷）一词与“哀恸的人”形容了同样的一群人，他们是谁？（参诗篇35：13－18）

4\. (Verse 5) Jesus gives a good description of what it means to be meek in 5:38-42. How would you describe such a person?

（太5：5）在太5：38－42里耶稣对温柔的人有个很好的描述。你是怎样描述此类人的？

5\. “They will inherit the earth.” Why would the world not expect that kind of description of what “the meek” will get? In what way do believers “inherit the earth”? (Find some verses in Psalm 34 that would help us answer that question.)

“他们必承受地土。”为什么世界对于“温柔”的人所将得到的不是这样的期待呢？信徒以什么方式“承受地土”呢？（从诗篇34篇中的一些经文帮助你回答问题）

6\. How would you describe what each of the following are?

你如何来描述以下列出的每一项是什么？

“those who hunger and thirst for righteousness” 饥渴慕义

“the merciful” 怜恤

“the pure in heart” 清心

“the peacemakers” 使人和睦的人

“those who are persecuted because of righteousness” 为义受逼迫的人

7\. (Verses 11-12) In what way does persecution become a test of one’s faith?

（太5：11－12）逼迫如何成为对一个基督徒信仰的检验？

Matthew 5:13-48 Further Description of True Believers

马太福音5：13－48 进一步描述真正的信徒

8\. (Verses 13-16) Explain how Christians are “salt” and “light” in the world. (Remember that salt was used in the ancient world to keep food from rotting.)

（太5：13－16）解释基督徒是怎样成为世上的“盐”和“光”。（记住盐是古代人们给食物防腐用的）

9\. (Verses 17-20) What do verses 19 and 20 lead you to see about yourself?

（太5：17－20）19与20节的经文是怎样引导你看待自己的生活的？

Verse 21 begins a series of verses in which Jesus explains that his Law’s demands are much deeper than the shallow understanding of the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law.

由 21节开始的一系列的经文中，耶稣解释了他在律法上的要求比法利赛和文士对法律的浅显解释要深刻的多。

10\. (Verses 21-26) What is the main point of verses 21-26? Can you give an example of how these words of Jesus would affect the life of a believer today?

（太5：21－26）21节到26节的中心思想是什么？你能举例说明耶稣的这些话是怎样影响今天信徒的生活的？

11\. (Verses 27-30) Where does adultery begin? What point is Jesus making in verses 29-30?

（太5：27－30）奸淫是从哪里开始的？耶稣通过29到30节要说明什么？

(Verses 31-32) Verse 32 is difficult to interpret. The following comments from The People’s Bible help us understand the verse a little better:

（太5：31－32）32节是很难解释的。《大众圣经》帮助我们更好地理解这节经文：

The NIV translation of verse 32 is unfortunate: “causes her to become an adulteress.” It suggests that a woman who has been divorced by her husband is automatically an adulteress, that she is guilty of adultery because of what her husband has done. It also suggests that any man who then marries her is also guilty of adultery.

新国际版圣经对于32节“就是叫她作淫妇了”的翻译是很不幸的。它暗指一个女人一旦被他的丈夫休了她自己就成了淫妇。这么说因她丈夫做的事她却犯了奸淫罪。这里也说任何男人随后娶她，也是犯了奸淫了。

The passive verb form in the Greek has no real equivalent in English, but a clumsy rendering would go something like this: A man who divorces his wife makes her one who has been “adultered.” She has been victimized by his adultery, although she had no part in it. She is stigmatized as one who may have committed adultery, because some will assume that of her, even if her husband does not charge her with such an offense. And any man who marries her will then also be suspect.

希腊文动词的被动语态与英文是不尽相同的，但是笨拙的翻译将会变成这样的：一个男人如果休了自己的妻子，那他就使妻子成为“被奸淫的”。尽管她与此无关，她却成了他所犯的奸淫罪的受害者。尽管她的丈夫没有给她这样的罪名，因为有人会这样想， 她就被烙上一个犯奸淫的罪名。任何和她结婚的男人也就成了被嫌疑的对象。

So Jesus is not pronouncing judgment on innocent people here. He is rather reminding us that a divorce is always a serious matter for both husband and wife. Regardless of the degree of responsibility each may bear for the divorce, both are tarnished by it. And one or both may even forfeit their place in the kingdom of God by reason of the divorce.[1]

所以在这里耶稣没有向无辜的人宣判，他是在提醒大家无论对丈夫还是妻子离婚总是严重的事情。不管每一方对离婚应承担多少责任，双方都受到了玷污。一方或双方甚至会因为离婚的缘故，从而丧失了他们在神国中的地位。1

12\. Explain in your own words what Jesus means in verse 32.

用自己的话解释耶稣在32节话语的含义。

13\. (Verses 33-37) These words speak about taking oaths or swearing. What does verse 37 say about the need for swearing?

（太5：33－37）这些话是指着起誓和发誓来说的。关于需不需要发誓37节的经文是如何教导的？

14\. (Verses 38-42) The Old Testament words eye for eye, and tooth for tooth were God’s guidelines to make sure that the punishment fits the crime. Jesus’ words, however, show us that people were using these words in a wrong way. What was the wrong purpose for which they were using them?

（太5：38－42）旧约经文“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”是上帝使处罚与罪行相称的原则。然而，耶稣的话告诉我们人们错误地使用这段话。他们使用这些话的错误意图有哪些？

(Verses 43-48) （5：43－48）

15\. Give examples of how these words make Christianity very different from other religions in the world.

举例说明这段经文如何体现了基督教与世界上其它宗教的区别。

16\. What purpose does verse 48 serve in the Christian life?

太 5： 48节经文在基督徒生活中有什么作用？
