Getting Started   A German Lutheran hymn for Good Friday states, O große Not! Gott selbst ist tot.  An English translation would be, “O terrible necessity!  God himself is dead!”  As difficult as it is for the human mind to comprehend such a thing, God the Son died on Good Friday.  It was possible only because he shared our human nature.  It was prompted only by his boundless love for humanity.  It accomplished what no other act could – the forgiveness of sins for all humankind.  The believer travels to the cross in sorrow to witness Jesus’ death, but he/she does so in anticipation of the resurrection and its limitless joy.

开始：德国信义宗关于受难日的一首诗是这样的，“O große Not! Gott selbst ist tot.  ”英语翻译过来是这样的意思，“哦 可怕的必然！上帝自己死了！”以人类的思维来理解这件事情是非常困难的，上帝的儿子在受难日死了。这样的事发生只有一种可能就是他也有人的的形象。这样的事发生是因着他对人类无限的爱。它达成了其他方法所无法做到的——对整个人类罪的饶恕。信徒来到十字架前在痛苦中目睹耶稣的死，但是他（她）如此行是带着复活以及因复活而有的无限喜乐的期盼。

#### A.  Jesus Dies	   	Matthew 27:48-54  	Mark 15:33-39; Luke 23:44-49  	John 19:28-37 耶稣死了       《太》27：48－54，《可》15：33－39；《路》23：44－49；《约》19：28－37

1\.   Why does Jesus take a drink now when he refused one at the beginning of his crucifixion?

为什么耶稣现在喝了一点，而在钉十字架开始时拒绝喝了呢？

He has something important to say, and he wants to say it with a loud voice.	

他有重要的话要讲，他要用大声来讲话。

2\.   How does the reader piece together the above Bible references to include statements 5-7 made by Jesus from the cross?

读者是怎样从以上的经文来将耶稣十架七言的最后三句总结出来的呢？

5) “I am thirsty.”  6) “It is finished!”  7) “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”

5）“我渴了”。6）“成了”。7）“父啊，我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”

3\.   The tearing of the temple’s curtain is a dramatic statement by God concerning what the death of Jesus accomplished.  The curtain, which separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, was as thick as a man’s hand is wide and could not have been torn in two by an earthquake.  The priests would have been in the Holy Place at this time preparing for evening sacrifice, and it was unlawful for them to look into or enter the Most Holy Place.  Only the High Priest could enter that room on the Day of Atonement.  What, therefore, was God demonstrating by the tearing of the curtain at Jesus’ death? (See Hebrews 9:23-26.)

圣殿幔子的裂开是上帝对于耶稣的死所成就的一个戏剧性的宣言。这个幔子是连接圣所到至圣所的，这个幔子的厚度如同人手的宽度，就是一场地震也不会使幔子裂为两半的。当时祭司应在至圣所正在预备晚上的祭物，任何人想要看至圣所都是法律不允许的。只有大祭司在赎罪日那天才能进入至圣所。这样上帝在耶稣死亡的时候撕裂圣殿幔子又是要显明什么？（参《希伯来书》9：23－26）

All Old Testament sacrifices pointed ahead to the one, all-sufficient sacrifice to be made by God’s Son.  Because the sacrifice had now been made, the entire Old Testament system of ritual and sacrifice was no longer necessary.  The Ceremonial Law no longer needed to be practiced.

旧约的献祭都是指向由上帝儿子所预备的唯一的，全备的祭。因为现在祭已经献过了，旧约的整个仪式与献祭的系统就不再需要了，旧约礼仪也不再需要进行。
 
4\.   What information is difficult to understand in Matthew 27:52-53?

《马太福音》27：52－53节给我们什么信息是比较难理解的？

Nothing is told us about who they were or what they did between the time of Jesus’ death and resurrection.

没有给我们说明在耶稣死亡与复活这一段时间中的那些人是谁与他们做了什么事。

5\.   As we compare each gospel to the others, what conclusion do we come to regarding what the centurion actually said at Jesus’ death?  What caused him to draw that conclusion?

与其他的福音书对比，我们能看到百夫长提到耶稣的死得出什么结论？什么事促使他得出这样的结论呢？

He said both things:  1) Surely this was a righteous man, and 2) Surely this was the Son of God.  He drew this conclusion by what he had heard and seen at the cross.  There may have been background information he had also gathered from observing and hearing about Jesus earlier.

他说到两方面的事情：1）这真是一个义人，2）这真是上帝的儿子。他得出这样的结论是基于他所听到以及所看到耶稣钉十字架时的情行。他也有可能先前通过观察与听说搜集了一些关于耶稣的背景资料 。

6\.   Why would breaking the legs of a crucified person bring death more quickly?

为什么打断钉在十字架上人的腿，他就会死的快些？

Their full weight suspended from their arms alone would make it impossible to breathe.

他们的整个体重只能靠手臂来支撑，这会使他们无法呼吸。

7\.   Who is “the man” of John 19:35, and what does he say is the purpose of his testimony?

《约翰福音》19：35节“那个人”是谁？他做见证的目的是什么？

“The man” is the gospel writer, the Apostle John, an eye witness at the cross.  His testimony about the death of Jesus is given so that the reader may believe.

“那个人”就是福音书作者，使徒约翰，十字架的目击证人。他所给的关于耶稣死的见证是让读者能够相信耶稣。

8\.   What does the “sudden flow of blood and water” signify?

突然有“血和水流出来”有什么象征意义？

It shows that Jesus was dead.  His circulatory system was no longer functioning in a normal way.

这说明耶稣死了。他的血液循环系统不再正常运行。

9\.   Why does John add the information on broken bones and piercing Jesus’ side?

为什么约翰的信息加上了打断腿和刺透耶稣肋旁的事？

To show that every Old Testament promise about the Savior was fulfilled in Jesus’ life and death.  Therefore he truly was the promised Messiah, the Son of God.

表明旧约关于救主的应许都在耶稣的生与死上应验，他真是所应许的弥赛亚，上帝的儿子。

#### B.  Jesus Is Buried  		Matthew 27:55-66	Mark 15:40-47; Luke 23:50-56	John 19:38-42  耶稣的安葬                      《太》27：55－66，《可》15：40－47；《路》23：50－56；《约》19：38－42

10\. As we look at the accounts of Jesus’ burial, take note of the following:

当我们来看耶稣安葬的时候，记住以下的几件事：

A. The role Joseph and Nicodemus played in Jewish society

约瑟和尼哥底母在犹太人社会中的角色

They were both disciples of Jesus.  Nicodemus was a member of the Jewish Council, and Joseph is described as “rich,” possibly also a member of the Council.

他们都是耶稣的门徒。尼哥底母是犹太公会的成员，约瑟是被描述为一个富人，好像也是公会的成员。

B. The significance of the kind of grave into which Jesus was placed (see Isaiah 53:9)

安葬耶稣的坟墓的象征意义在哪里。（参《以赛亚书》53：9）

It was a grave of the rich.  The poor were buried in the ground or in a tomb they shared with several deceased people.

这是一个富人的坟墓。穷人一般是安葬在土里或者与其他死去的亲人共享一个坟墓。

C. What Jewish burial practices were like in Jesus’ day

在耶稣的那个年代犹太人安葬的习俗是怎样的。

The body was wrapped in strips of linen with spices placed between each layer of cloth.

用亚麻布加上香料来层层来包裹身体。

D. What the Jewish leaders feared, and how Pilate dealt with that issue

犹太领袖们害怕什么呢，彼拉多是怎么来处理这个争端的。

The Jewish leaders feared that one of Jesus’ disciples would steal the body and make up a story of a resurrection, deceiving the people even further.  Pilate ordered that soldiers and an official government seal on the tomb should make the tomb as secure as (they) knew how.  

犹太领袖害怕耶稣的门徒会来偷走耶稣的尸体然后编造一个复活的谎言，从而会更加迷惑众人。彼拉多命令士兵们和犹太官方封住坟墓，把那个坟墓把守妥当。

E. The activity (and plan) of the women who were present

在场的妇女们的活动（和计划）

They wanted to participate in this last way of honoring Jesus, so they observed where the body was and made plans to return as soon as possible after the Sabbath was completed.  Sabbath ended at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, but they could not do this work in the dark, so they waited until sunrise on Sunday morning.

她们要参与对耶稣敬重的最后一个关节，所以她们计划在过完安息日后马上再赶来。安息日结束的时间是礼拜六下午6：00，但是她们不可能在黑暗中做工，所以她们要等到礼拜天早上日出的时候。

11\. How do these sections of the gospels get us ready for the resurrection account?

福音书的这些描述如何为复活的事情做准备？

The tomb was as secure as possible, and Roman soldiers could not stop the resurrection of God’s Son.  There would be people at the tomb with whom the angel could share the message – the woman who came at sunrise.

坟墓已经把守妥当了，但是罗马的士兵是不能阻止神儿子复活的发生的。天使传递信息时需要有人在坟墓那里 － 妇女们在日出时来了。

12\. What personal assurance do you receive in reading about Jesus’ death and burial?

当你看到耶稣的死与埋葬的时候，对你个人而言你得到了哪些方面的确信。

My sins are truly forgiven, and death has been conquered for me, so I live in hope of unending life to come.

我的罪真的被赦免了，我已经征服了死亡，所以我活在永生的希望当中。

13\. With what kind of attitude or feeling do you worship on the anniversary of Jesus’ death (Good Friday?)  

在纪念耶稣受死的时候，你有什么样的态度或者情感来对待。（受难日）

Sorrow and joy mixed.  Sorrow that I caused this death, joy that it ends in victory.

难过与喜乐的交织，难过的是我导致了这个死亡，喜乐的是它以胜利告终。
