Getting Started The Passover Meal has been celebrated. In the course of that meal Jesus had demonstrated and spoken of humility and true greatness, he had warned Judas of the danger of the choice he was making, he had given his disciples the new Supper as part of the New Covenant, and he had warned them, and especially Peter, about the negative things that lay ahead. The lengthy Upper Room conversation recorded by John continues in chapters 14-17. Since the purpose of this course is to study the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus, we look at only the highlights of that conversation, particularly the parts that deal specifically with his leaving them.

开始：逾越节的筵席已经举行过了。在那一次的筵席中，耶稣已经示范并讲叙了有关谦卑和什么是真伟大的道理，他也警告了犹大他所做出的选择的危险性，他给自己的门徒们设立了新约圣餐，同时也就会发生的不好的事情警告了他们，尤其是彼得。约翰所记载的这次发生在 楼上大房间里的漫长对话一直延续到《约翰福音》14－17章。既然我们这门课的目的是学习耶稣的受难、受死以及复活，我们就仅注重这个对话中的关键部分，尤其是关于他将要离开门徒的记载。
