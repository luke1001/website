DAILY PRAYERS
How the head of the family should teach his household to pray morning and evening
Morning Prayer
In the morning when you get up, make the sign of the holy cross and say:
In the name of the Father and of the + Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you choose, you may also say this little prayer:
I thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray that You would keep me this day also from sin and every evil, that all my doings and life may please You. For into Your hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the evil foe may have no power over me. Amen.
Then go joyfully to your work, singing a hymn, like that of the Ten Commandments, or whatever your devotion may suggest.
Evening Prayer
In the evening when you go to bed, make the sign of the holy cross and say:
In the name of the Father and of the + Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Then kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you choose, you may also say this little prayer:
I thank You, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Your dear Son, that You have graciously kept me this day; and I pray that You would forgive me all my sins where I have done wrong, and graciously keep me this night. For into Your hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Your holy angel be with me, that the evil foe may have no power over me. Amen.
Then go to sleep at once and in good cheer.
How the head of the family should teach his household to ask a blessing and return thanks
Asking a Blessing
The children and members of the household shall go to the table reverently, fold their hands, and say:
The eyes of all look to You, [O LORD,] and You give them their food at the proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing. (Ps. 145: 15–16)
Then shall be said the Lord’s Prayer and the following:
Lord God, heavenly Father, bless us and these Your gifts which we receive from Your bountiful goodness, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
Returning Thanks
Also, after eating, they shall, in like manner, reverently and with folded hands say:
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His love endures forever. [He] gives food to every creature. He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call. His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight in the legs of a man; the LORD delights in those who fear Him, who put their hope in His unfailing love. (Ps. 136:1, 25; 147:9–11)
Then shall be said the Lord’s Prayer and the following:
We thank You, Lord God, heavenly Father, for all Your benefits, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.

日用祷文
家长应如此教导家人早晚祈祷

早祷
早上起床时，画圣十字架，并说：

奉父、子、圣灵的名。阿们。

然后，或跪或立，诵信经并主祷文。你也可以选用这篇短祷文：

我的天父啊！我藉着耶稣基督，你的爱子，感谢你。因你昨夜保护我没有遇见甚么灾害危险。还祈求你今日仍然保护我，不陷在罪与任何凶恶里；使我一切行为与生活，都蒙你的喜悦。因我将我自己，我的身体、灵魂和一切，都交托在你手里。愿你的圣天使与我同在，使那恶敌没有权力辖制我。阿们。

然后唱一首诗，如论十条诫的诗，或灵修所引起意念的诗，欢然地去工作。

晚祷
晚间上床时，画圣十字架，并说：

奉父、子、圣灵的名。阿们。

然后，或跪或立，诵信经并主祷文。你也可以选用这篇短祷文：

我的天父啊！我藉着耶稣基督，你的爱子，感谢你。因你今天曾经施恩保护了我。还祈求你赦免我一切的罪，就是我做错了的事；并求施恩今夜保护我。因我将我自己，我的身体、灵魂和一切，都交托在你手里。愿你的圣天使与我同在，使那恶敌没有权力辖制我。阿们。

然后立即欢然就寝。

家长应如此教导家人在饭前求福和饭后谢恩

求福
儿女与家属当虔诚合手来到桌前，说：

(主啊，)万民都举目仰望你；你随时给他们食物。你张手，使有生气的都随愿饱足。（诗145:15-16）

然后，用主祷文及以下的祷告：

主上帝，天父啊！求你赐福给我们，和你这些恩赐，就是我们从你丰富的慈爱中所领受的。奉靠我们的主耶稣基督。阿们。

谢恩
饭后他们也照样虔诚合手，说：

你们要称谢耶和华，因他本为善；他的慈爱永远长存。他赐粮食给凡有血气的，他赐食给走兽和啼叫的小乌鸦。他不喜悦马的力大，不喜爱人的腿快。耶和华喜爱敬畏他和盼望他慈爱的人。（诗136:1，25a;147:9-11）

然后，用主祷文及以下的祷告：

主上帝，天父啊！我们为你所赐的一切恩惠感谢你。奉靠我们的主耶稣基督，祂与你和圣灵活着掌权，直到永永远远。阿们。
