THE SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household
What is the Sacrament of the Altar?
It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under the bread and wine, instituted by Christ Himself for us Christians to eat and to drink.
Where is this written?
The holy Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and St. Paul write:Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said: “Take, eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.”
In the same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
What is the benefit of this eating and drinking?
These words, “Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins,” show us that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us through these words. For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation.
How can bodily eating and drinking do such great things?
Certainly not just eating and drinking do these things, but the words written here: “Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.” These words, along with the bodily eating and drinking, are the main thing in the Sacrament. Whoever believes these words has exactly what they say: “forgiveness of sins.”
Who receives this sacrament worthily?
Fasting and bodily preparation are certainly fine outward training. But that person is truly worthy and well prepared who has faith in these words: “Given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins.”
But anyone who does not believe these words or doubts them is unworthy and unprepared, for the words “for you” require all hearts to believe.

圣餐礼
家长应以此简明的方式教导一家的人。

圣餐礼是甚么？
就是我们主耶稣基督的真身体和血，在饼和酒里，赐给基督徒吃喝。这是基督亲自设立的。

这事记在何处？
福音书的作者马太、马可、路加，和圣保罗这样写着：「我主耶稣基督被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来，祝谢了，擘开递给门徒，说：『你们拿着吃；这是我的身体，为你们舍的。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。』」

「饭后也照样拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：『你们都喝这个；这杯是用我的血所立的新约，就是为你们流出来的，使罪得赦。你们每逢喝的时候要如此行，为的是记念我。』」

这样的吃喝有什么益处呢？
「为你们舍的，为你们流出来的，使罪得赦。」这些话向我们表明：在这圣礼中藉着这些话，将赦罪、生命和救恩都赐给我们了。因为那里有赦罪，那里就有生命和救恩。

肉身的吃喝怎能行这些大事呢？
只是吃喝自然不能行这些大事，成事的是这里所写的话：「为你们舍的，为你们流出来的，使罪得赦。」这些话，连同肉身的吃喝，是这圣礼的主体。凡信这些话的，就正得着所说的赦罪。

谁配领受这圣礼呢？
禁食与身体的准备当然是良好的外在训练。但人若信这些话：「为你们舍的，为你们流出来的，使罪得赦」，那人就是真正配领受，也是准备好去领受了。

但任何人不信这些话或有怀疑，那人就是不配领受，也没有准备好；因为「为你们」这些字是要求人一心相信。
