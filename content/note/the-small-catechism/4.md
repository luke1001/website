THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY BAPTISM
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household
First
What is Baptism?
Baptism is not just plain water, but it is the water included in God’s command and combined with God’s word.
Which is that word of God?
Christ our Lord says in the last chapter of Matthew: “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 28:19)
Second
What benefits does Baptism give?
It works forgiveness of sins, rescues from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.
Which are these words and promises of God?
Christ our Lord says in the last chapter of Mark: “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.” (Mark 16:16)
Third
How can water do such great things?
Certainly not just water, but the word of God in and with the water does these things, along with the faith which trusts this word of God in the water. For without God’s word the water is plain water and no Baptism. But with the word of God it is a Baptism, that is, a life-giving water, rich in grace, and a washing of the new birth in the Holy Spirit, as St. Paul says in Titus, chapter three: “He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying.” (Titus 3:5–8)
Fourth
What does such baptizing with water indicate?
It indicates that the Old Adam in us should by daily contrition and repentance be drowned and die with all sins and evil desires, and that a new man should daily emerge and arise to live before God in righteousness and purity forever.
Where is this written?
St. Paul writes in Romans chapter six: “We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.” (Rom. 6:4)

圣洗礼
家长应以此简明的方式教导一家的人。

第一题
洗礼是什么？
洗礼不只是寻常的水，而是水包含在上帝的命令中，与上帝的话语联合。

上帝这话语是甚么呢？
我们的主基督在马太福音末章说：「你们要去，使万民作我的门徒。奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。」（太28:19）

第二题
洗礼赐予什么益处呢？
洗礼使罪得赦，并救人脱离死亡和魔鬼；并且凡相信这是上帝的话语和应许所宣告的，就得着永远的救恩。

上帝这话语和应许是什么呢？
我们的主基督在马可福音末章说：「信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。」（可16:16）

第三题
水怎能行这样的大事呢？
单凭水确是不能，但上帝的话语在水里与水联合，作成这事，而信靠上帝在水中的话语之信心，亦附带作成。因为没有上帝的话语，那水只是寻常的水，而不是洗礼。可是若有上帝的话语与水联合，那就是洗礼；也即是含有丰盛恩典的，赐生命的水；亦是圣灵使人重生的洗。正如圣保罗在提多书第三章所说：「他便救了我们；……乃是照他的怜悯，藉着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。圣灵就是上帝藉着耶稣基督──我们救主厚厚浇灌在我们身上的，好叫我们因他的恩得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣。这话是可信的。」（多3:5-8）

第四题
用水这样施洗表明什么？
这表明我们里面的老亚当，连同一切罪恶和邪情私欲，应当藉着每日的痛心、悔改，被淹没而死。并且新人应当每日复生兴起，永远在上帝面前公义纯洁地活着。

这道记在何处呢？
圣保罗在罗马书第六章说：「所以，我们藉着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督藉着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。」（罗6:4）
