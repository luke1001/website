CHRISTIAN QUESTIONS WITH THEIR ANSWERS
Prepared by Dr. Dr. Martin Luther for those who intend to go to the Sacrament
After confession and instruction in the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, the pastor may ask, or Christians may ask themselves these questions:
1. Do you believe that you are a sinner?
Yes, I believe it. I am a sinner.
2. How do you know this?
From the Ten Commandments, which I have not kept.
3. Are you sorry for your sins?
Yes, I am sorry that I have sinned against God.
4. What have you deserved from God because of your sins?
His wrath and displeasure, temporal death, and eternal damnation. See Rom. 6:21, 23.
5. Do you hope to be saved?
Yes, that is my hope.
6. In whom then do you trust?
In my dear Lord Jesus Christ.
7. Who is Christ?
The Son of God, true God and man.
8. How many Gods are there?
Only one, but there are three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
9. What has Christ done for you that you trust in Him?
He died for me and shed His blood for me on the cross for the forgiveness of sins.
10. Did the Father also die for you?
He did not. The Father is God only, as is the Holy Spirit; but the Son is both true God and true man. He died for me and shed His blood for me.
11. How do you know this?
From the holy Gospel, from the words instituting the Sacrament, and by His body and blood given me as a pledge in the Sacrament.
12. What are the words of institution?
Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said: “Take eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.”
In the same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them, saying: “Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
13. Do you believe, then, that the true body and blood of Christ are in the Sacrament?
Yes, I believe it.
14. What convinces you to believe this?
The word of Christ: Take, eat, this is My body; drink of it, all of you, this is My blood.
15. What should we do when we eat His body and drink His blood, and in this way receive His pledge?
We should remember and proclaim His death and the shedding of His blood, as He taught us: This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.
16. Why should we remember and proclaim His death?
First, so that we may learn to believe that no creature could make satisfaction for our sins. Only Christ, true God and man, could do that. Second, so we may learn to be horrified by our sins, and to regard them as very serious. Third, so we may find joy and comfort in Christ alone, and through faith in Him be saved.
17. What motivated Christ to die and make full payment for your sins?
His great love for His Father and for me and other sinners, as it is written in John 14; Romans 5; Galatians 2; and Ephesians 5.
18. Finally, why do you wish to go to the Sacrament?
That I may learn to believe that Christ, out of great love, died for my sin, and also learn from Him to love God and my neighbor.
19. What should admonish and encourage a Christian to receive the Sacrament frequently?
First, both the command and the promise of Christ the Lord. Second, his own pressing need, because of which the command, encouragement, and promise are given.
20. But what should you do if you are not aware of this need and have no hunger and thirst for the Sacrament?
To such a person no better advice can be given than this: first, he should touch his body to see if he still has flesh and blood. Then he should believe what the Scriptures say of it in Galatians 5 and Romans 7. Second, he should look around to see whether he is still in the world, and remember that there will be no lack of sin and trouble, as the Scriptures say in John 15–16 and in 1 John 2 and 5.
Third, he will certainly have the devil also around him, who with his lying and murdering day and night will let him have no peace, within or without, as the Scriptures picture him in John 8 and 16; 1 Peter 5; Ephesians 6; and 2 Timothy 2.
Note: These questions and answers are no child’s play, but are drawn up with great earnestness of purpose by the venerable and devout Dr. Luther for both young and old. Let each one pay attention and consider it a serious matter; for St. Paul writes to the Galatians in chapter six: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.”

基督徒问答
马丁路德博士为预备领圣礼者著作。

在认信和教导十条诫、信经、主祷文、圣洗礼和圣餐礼之后，牧师可以问，或基督徒可以自己问下面的题目：

1. 你相信你是个罪人吗？
是，我信。我是个罪人。

2. 你怎么知道呢？
从十条诫我知道我没有遵守。

3. 你为自己的罪伤心吗？
是，我因得罪了上帝而伤心。

4. 你因自己的罪当从上帝得到甚么呢？
祂的震怒和不悦、身体的死亡和永远的沉沦。（参看罗6:21、23）

5. 你盼望得救吗？
是，这是我所盼望的。

6. 那么，你信靠我们亲爱的主耶稣基督吗?
我信靠我亲爱的主耶稣基督。

7. 基督是谁？
上帝的儿子，真神，也是真人。

8. 真神有几位？
只有一位，但祂有三个位格：父、子、和圣灵。

9. 基督为你做了甚么事，使你信靠祂呢？
祂为我而死，为我在十字架上流血，使罪得赦。

10 .圣父有为你而死吗？
祂没有。圣父纯是真神，圣灵也一样；但圣子是真神也是真人。圣子为我而死，为我流血。

11.你怎么知道这事呢？
从圣福音、从设立圣礼的话，并从圣礼中祂所赐的身体和宝血作为保证。

12.设立这圣礼的话是怎样的呢？
我主耶稣基督被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来，祝谢了，擘开，递给门徒说：「你们拿着吃；这是我的身体，为你们舍的。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。」

饭后，也照样拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们说：「你们都喝这个；这杯是用我的血所立的新约，就是为你们流出来的，使罪得赦。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。」

13.那么，你相信基督的真身体与宝血是存在于这圣礼中吗？
是的，我信。

14.是甚么令你相信呢？
是基督的话：「拿着吃，这是我的身体；你们都喝这个，这是我的血。」

15.在我们吃喝祂的身体宝血，从而领受祂的保证的时候，我们应当做甚么？
我们当记念并宣扬祂的死亡与流血，正如祂所教导的：「你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。」

16.我们为甚么要记念和宣扬祂的死亡？
首先，我们可以学到：要相信并无任何受造之物能够为我们的罪付出应偿的赎价。唯独基督这真神真人才能做到。第二，我们可以学到为自己的罪感到震栗，认为罪是十分严重的事。第三，我们可以单从基督找到喜乐与安慰，藉信祂而得救。

17.是甚么促使基督为你的罪而死，以付出完全赎价呢？
是祂对天父、对我、和对其他罪人的大爱，正如经上所记：约14；罗5；加2；弗5。

18.最后要问：你为甚么希望去领圣礼呢？
为要学习相信基督出于大爱，为我的罪而死；也从祂学到去爱上帝和邻舍。

19.有甚么敦促和激励基督徒去常常领受圣礼呢？
首先是主基督的命令和应许。其次是他自己逼切的需要。因为那命令、鼓励、和应许都是为此而给予的。

20.但你若未觉察这需要，又未对圣礼有饥渴，你当怎样办呢？
对这样的人，没有比这更好的忠告：首先，他要摸摸自己的身体，看看他是否仍然有血有肉。然后他要相信圣经在加5，罗7中论这事所说的话。第二、他要环顾四周，看看他是否仍然在这世界中，并记取到处都充满罪恶和烦恼，正如圣经在约15-16与约壹2，5所言。第三、他当然有魔鬼环绕他，并日夜不停地用谎言和杀机使他内外不得平安，正如圣经在约8，16；彼前5；弗6；提后2所描述他的境况。

附注: 这些问答并非儿戏，而是可敬的、虔诚的路德博士出于非常恳切之心，为老少而写成的。愿人人都留心，加以重视；因为圣保罗在加拉太书第六章这样说：「不要自欺，上帝是轻慢不得的。」
