TABLE OF DUTIES
Certain passages of Scripture for various holy orders and positions, admonishing them about their duties and responsibilities
To Bishops, Pastors, and Preachers
The overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. 1 Tim. 3:2–4
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 1 Tim. 3:6
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. Titus 1:9
What the Hearers Owe Their Pastors
The Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. 1 Cor. 9:14
Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Gal. 6:6–7
The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, “Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,” and “The worker deserves his wages.” 1 Tim. 5:17–18
We ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. 1 Thess. 5:12–13
Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you. Heb. 13:17
Of Civil Government
Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God’s servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God’s servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrong-doer. Rom. 13:1–4
Of Citizens
Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s. Matt. 22:21
It is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. Rom. 13:5–7
I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior. 1 Tim. 2:1–3
Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good. Titus 3:1
Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 1 Peter 2:13–14
To Husbands
Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. 1 Peter 3:7
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Col. 3:19
To Wives
Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. Eph. 5:22
They were submissive to their own husbands, like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. 1 Peter 3:5–6
To Parents
Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. Eph. 6:4
To Children
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and your mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise—“that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.” Eph. 6:1–3
To Workers of All Kinds
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free. Eph. 6:5–8
To Employers and Supervisors
Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him. Eph. 6:9
To Youth
Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time. 1 Peter 5:5–6
To Widows
The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 1 Tim. 5:5–6
To Everyone
The commandments … are summed up in this one rule: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Rom. 13:9
I urge … that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone. 1 Tim. 2:1
Let each his lesson learn with care, and all the household well shall fare.

信徒职责录
以下经文适用于各种圣职和位份，训勉他们负起其职责与任务。

论监督、牧师、和传道人
作监督的，必须无可指责，只作一个妇人的丈夫，有节制，自守，端正，乐意接待远人，善于教导；不因酒滋事，不打人，只要温和，不争竞，不贪财；好好管理自己的家，使儿女凡事端庄顺服〔或作端端庄庄地使儿女顺服〕。（提前3:2-4）

初入教的不可作监督，恐怕他自高自大，就落在魔鬼所受的刑罚里。（提前3:6）

坚守所教真实的道理，就能将纯正的教训劝化人，又能把争辩的人驳倒了。（多1:9）

听道者当怎样对待他们的牧师和教师
主也是这样命定，叫传福音的靠着福音养生。（林前9:14）

在道理上受教的，当把一切需用的供给施教的人。不要自欺，上帝是轻慢不得的。人种的是甚么，收的也是甚么。（加6:6-7）

那善于管理教会的长老，当以为配受加倍的敬奉；那劳苦传道教导人的，更当如此。因为经上说：「牛在场上踹谷的时候，不可笼住牠的嘴」；又说：「工人得工价是应当的。」（提前5:17-18）

弟兄们，我们劝你们敬重那在你们中间劳苦的人，就是在主里面治理你们、劝戒你们的；又因他们所做的工，用爱心格外尊重他们。你们也要彼此和睦。（帖前5:12-13）

你们要依从那些引导你们的，且要顺服；因他们为你们的灵魂时刻警醒，好像那将来交账的人。你们要使他们交的时候有快乐，不致忧愁；若忧愁就与你们无益了。（来13:17）

论政府
在上有权柄的，人人当顺服他，因为没有权柄不是出于上帝的。凡掌权的都是上帝所命的。所以，抗拒掌权的就是抗拒上帝的命；抗拒的必自取刑罚。作官的原不是叫行善的惧怕，乃是叫作恶的惧怕。你愿意不惧怕掌权的吗？你只要行善，就可得他的称赞；因为他是上帝的用人，是与你有益的。你若作恶，却当惧怕，因为他不是空空地佩剑；他是上帝的用人，是伸冤的，刑罚那作恶的。（罗13:1-4）

论人民
他们说：「是凯撒的。」耶稣说：「这样，凯撒的物当归给凯撒；上帝的物当归给上帝。」（太22:21）

所以，你们必须顺服，不但是因为刑罚，也是因为良心。你们纳粮，也为这个缘故；因他们是上帝的差役，常常特管这事。凡人所当得的，就给他。当得粮的，给他纳粮；当得税的，给他上税；当惧怕的，惧怕他；当恭敬的，恭敬他。（罗13:5-7）

我劝你，第一要为万人恳求、祷告、代求、祝谢；为君王和一切在位的，也该如此，使我们可以敬虔、端正、平安无事的度日。这是好的，在上帝我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。（提前2:1-3）

你要提醒众人，叫他们顺服作官的、掌权的，遵他的命，预备行各样的善事。（多3:1）

你们为主的缘故，要顺服人的一切制度，或是在上的君王，或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。（彼前2:13-14）

论丈夫
你们作丈夫的也要按情理和妻子同住；〔情理原文是知识〕因她比你软弱，〔比你软弱原文作是软弱的器皿〕与你一同承受生命之恩的，所以要敬重她。这样，便叫你们的祷告没有阻碍。（彼前3:7）

你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，不可苦待她们。（西3:19）

论妻子
你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。（弗5:22）

因为古时仰赖上帝的圣洁妇人正是以此为妆饰，顺服自己的丈夫，就如撒拉听从亚伯拉罕，称他为主。你们若行善，不因恐吓而害怕，便是撒拉的女儿了。（彼前3:5-6）

论父母
你们作父亲的，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒养育他们。（弗6:4）

论儿女
你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。「要孝敬父母，使你得福，在世长寿。」这是第一条带应许的诫命。（弗6:1-3）

论仆婢和工人
你们作仆人的，要惧怕战兢，用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人，好像听从基督一般。不要只在眼前事奉，像是讨人喜欢的，要像基督的仆人，从心里遵行上帝的旨意。甘心事奉，好像服事主，不像服事人。因为晓得各人所行的善事，不论是为奴的，是自主的，都必按所行的得主的赏赐。（弗6:5-8）

论雇主与上司
你们作主人的，待仆人也是一理，不要威吓他们。因为知道，他们和你们同有一位主在天上；他并不偏待人。（弗6:9）

论幼年人
你们年幼的，也要顺服年长的。就是你们众人也都要以谦卑束腰，彼此顺服；因为上帝阻挡骄傲的人，赐恩给谦卑的人。所以你们要自卑，服在上帝大能的手下，到了时候，他必叫你们升高。（彼前5:5-6）

论寡妇
那独居无靠、真为寡妇的，是仰赖上帝，昼夜不住地祈求祷告。但那好宴乐的寡妇正活着的时候也是死的。（提前5:5-6）

论万人
或有别的诫命，都包在爱人如己这一句话之内了。（罗13:9b）

我劝你，第一要为万人恳求、祷告、代求、祝谢。（提前2:1）

各自学习其课程，家庭老幼得安宁。
