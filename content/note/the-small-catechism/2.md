THE CREED
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household
The First Article: Creation
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
What does this mean? I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that He has given me my body and soul, eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason and all my senses, and still takes care of them. He also gives me clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, wife and children, land, animals, and all I have. He richly and daily provides me with all that I need to support this body and life. He defends me against all danger and guards and protects me from all evil. All this He does only out of fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or worthiness in me. For all this it is my duty to thank and praise, serve and obey Him.
This is most certainly true.
The Second Article: Redemption
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty. From thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.
What does this mean? I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil; not with gold or silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death, that I may be His own and live under Him in His kingdom and serve Him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, just as He is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity.
This is most certainly true.
The Third Article: Sanctification
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
What does this mean? I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith. In this Christian church He daily and richly forgives all my sins and the sins of all believers. On the Last Day He will raise me and all the dead, and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ.
This is most certainly true.

信经
家长应以此简明的方式教导一家的人。

第一段: 创造
我信上帝，全能的父，创造天地的主。

这是什么意思？ 我信上帝造我和万物；赐我身体、灵魂、耳目、百体、理性和感官，并且继续保存。衪又赐我衣屉、饮食、屋宇、家庭、妻子、儿女、土地、牲畜，和我拥有的一切。为养活我身体生命，衪每日丰富地供给我一切所需用的。无论有什么危险、凶恶，衪护庇、看顾、保佑我。这都是出于衪为父、为神的良善和怜悯，并不是因我有甚么功劳或配得的。为这一切的事，我有责任感谢、颂扬、事奉、顺从衪。

这是实在正确的。

第二段: 救赎
我信耶稣基督，上帝的独生子，我们的主，因着圣灵成孕，从童女马利亚所生，在本丢彼拉多手下遇难，被钉在十字架上，死了，葬了。下到地狱。第三天从死人里复活。后升天，坐在无所不能的父上帝的右边。将来必从那里降临，审判活人、死人。

这是什么意思？ 我信耶稣基督是我的主，就是从天父自永远而生的真神，也是从童女马利亚所生的真人；衪救赎我这失丧被定罪的人，从诸般罪恶，死亡，和魔鬼的权柄中赎买我、夺获我；不是用金银，乃是用衪的圣宝血，和无辜的苦难、死亡；为要使我属于衪，在衪的国度管理之下活着，并永远的在公义、无罪，和幸福内服事衪；正如衪从死里复活，永远活着掌权。

这是实在正确的。

第三段: 圣灵
我信圣灵，一圣基督教会、圣徒一体（英译原文：圣徒一体相通）、罪得赦免；肉身复活，并且永生。阿们。

这是什么意思？ 我信我不能凭自己的理性或力量信靠我主耶稣基督，或亲近衪；乃是圣灵用福音宣召我，用衪的恩赐启导我，使我成圣，并保存我在真信里；正如衪宣召聚集世上全基督教会，并启导他，使他成圣，更保存他在独一的真信里与耶稣基督联合。在这基督教会，圣灵每日多多的赦免我和众信徒一切的罪。到末日，圣灵使我和凡死了的人都复活，又赐永生给我的一切在基督里的信徒。

这是实在正确的。
