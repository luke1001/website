THE LORD’S PRAYER
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
The Introduction
Our Father who art in heaven.
What does this mean? With these words God tenderly invites us to believe that He is our true Father and that we are His true children, so that with all boldness and confidence we may ask Him as dear children ask their dear father.
The First Petition
Hallowed be Thy name.
What does this mean? God’s name is certainly holy in itself, but we pray in this petition that it may be kept holy among us also.
How is God’s name kept holy? God’s name is kept holy when the Word of God is taught in its truth and purity, and we, as the children of God, also lead holy lives according to it. Help us to do this, dear Father in heaven! But anyone who teaches or lives contrary to God’s Word profanes the name of God among us. Protect us from this, heavenly Father!
The Second Petition
Thy kingdom come.
What does this mean? The kingdom of God certainly comes by itself without our prayer, but we pray in this petition that it may come to us also.
How does God’s kingdom come? God’s kingdom comes when our heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe His holy Word and lead godly lives here in time and there in eternity.
The Third Petition
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
What does this mean? The good and gracious will of God is done even without our prayer, but we pray in this petition that it may be done among us also.
How is God’s will done? God’s will is done when He breaks and hinders every evil plan and purpose of the devil, the world, and our sinful nature, which do not want us to hallow God’s name or let His kingdom come; and when He strengthens and keeps us firm in His Word and faith until we die.
This is His good and gracious will.
The Fourth Petition
Give us this day our daily bread.
What does this mean? God certainly gives daily bread to everyone without our prayers, even to all evil people, but we pray in this petition that God would lead us to realize this and to receive our daily bread with thanksgiving.
What is meant by daily bread? Daily bread includes everything that has to do with the support and needs of the body, such as food, drink, clothing, shoes, house, home, land, animals, money, goods, a devout husband or wife, devout children, devout workers, devout and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace, health, self-control, good reputation, good friends, faithful neighbors, and the like.
The Fifth Petition
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
What does this mean? We pray in this petition that our Father in heaven would not look at our sins, or deny our prayer because of them. We are neither worthy of the things for which we pray, nor have we deserved them, but we ask that He would give them all to us by grace, for we daily sin much and surely deserve nothing but punishment. So we too will sincerely forgive and gladly do good to those who sin against us.
The Sixth Petition
And lead us not into temptation.
What does this mean? God tempts no one. We pray in this petition that God would guard and keep us so that the devil, the world, and our sinful nature may not deceive us or mislead us into false belief, despair, and other great shame and vice. Although we are attacked by these things, we pray that we may finally overcome them and win the victory.
The Seventh Petition
But deliver us from evil.
What does this mean? We pray in this petition, in summary, that our Father in heaven would rescue us from every evil of body and soul, possessions and reputation, and finally, when our last hour comes, give us a blessed end, and graciously take us from this valley of sorrow to Himself in heaven.
The Conclusion
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.* Amen.
What does this mean? This means that I should be certain that these petitions are pleasing to our Father in heaven, and are heard by Him; for He Himself has commanded us to pray in this way and has promised to hear us. Amen, amen means “yes, yes, it shall be so.”

主祷文
家长应以此简明的方式教导一家的人。

我们在天上的父：愿人都尊你的名为圣。愿你的国降临；愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。免我们的债，如同我们免了人的债。不叫我们遇见试探；救我们脱离凶恶。因为国度、权柄、荣耀，全是你的，直到永远。阿门。

启言：
我们在天上的父。
这是什么意思？ 上帝用这话温柔地引我们信祂为我们的真父，而我们为祂的真儿女；为要我们以亲爱儿女的身份，放胆无疑地求告亲爱的父亲。

第一祷告：
愿人都尊你的名为圣。
这是什么意思？ 上帝的名本身确然是神圣的，但我们在这祷告中，求祂的名也在我们中间得尊为圣。

上帝的名如何得尊为圣呢？ 要尊上帝的名为圣，就是将上帝的道，真纯地教训人；并且我们身为上帝的儿女，理当依从真道过圣洁的生活。求亲爱的天父帮助我们如此行！若有人的教训或生活违背了上帝的道，这就是在我们中间亵渎了上帝的名。求天父保守我们不致如此！

第二祷告：
愿你的国降临。
这是什么意思？ 上帝的国确是自己降临，并不在乎我们的祷告；但我们藉这祷告求祂的国也来到我们中间。

上帝的国怎样来临呢？ 所谓上帝的国来到，就是天父赐衪的圣灵给我们，使我们受恩而相信祂的圣道，并在此生和永生中过合乎衪旨意的生活。

第三祷告：
愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。
这是什么意思？ 上帝圣善洪恩的旨意成就，并不在乎我们的祷告；但我们在这祷告求这旨意也在我们中间成就。

上帝的旨意如何成就呢？ 所谓上帝的旨意成就： 即是衪破坏并阻挡魔鬼、世界，和我们罪性所出的邪谋与恶意。这些邪谋、恶意不愿我们尊上帝的名为圣，也不愿衪的国来临。也即是衪赐给我们力量，巩固我们在圣道与信心中，至死不变。这原是衪圣善洪恩的旨意。

第四祷告：
我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。
这是什么意思？ 上帝每日赐给我们饮食，甚至也赐给一切恶人，并不在乎我们祈求；但我们在这祷告求上帝使我们明白这事，并用感谢的心领受我们日用的饮食。

日用的饮食是指什么呢？ 日用的饮食包括了身体一切的供养和需要：如饮食、衣履、屋宇、家庭、土地、牲畜、财物；敬虔的夫妇、儿女、员工；敬虔诚信的管治者、良好的政府；风调雨顺、和平安妥、身心安泰；自律、美名；良友和忠信的邻居等等。

第五祷告：
免我们的债，如同我们免了人的债。
这是什么意思？ 我们在这祷告求天父不察看我们的罪，或因这些罪拒绝我们的祈求。　我们所求的事，我们是既非配得，亦非当得的；但我们恳请衪出于恩慈，把所求的赐给我们；因为我们每日犯罪甚多，实在只当领受刑罚。因此，我们也当诚意地宽恕，并乐意地善待那些得罪我们的人。

第六祷告：
不叫我们遇见试探。
这是什么意思？ 上帝原不试诱人。我们在这祷告求上帝护庇保守我们，免得魔鬼、世界、和我们的罪性欺骗或误导我们，陷入误信、绝望、和其他大辱大恶里。虽然我们会受到这些攻击，但祈求主使我们终于能克服致胜。

第七祷告：
救我们脱离凶恶。
这是什么意思？ 我们在这祷告里总结说：求天父拯救我们脱离一切对身体、灵魂、财物、名誉有损的凶恶；最后到临终的时候，求赐我们蒙福的善终，施恩从这悲伤的幽谷中救我们到衪所在的天堂里去。

结语：
因为国度、权柄、荣耀，全是你的，直到永远＊。阿们。
这是甚么意思？ 意思是我们应该确实知道这些祷告是天父所悦纳和垂听的；因为衪自己曾亲自命令我们这样祷告，并应许听允我们。「阿们，阿们」的意思就是说：「是的，是的，必要如此成就。」
