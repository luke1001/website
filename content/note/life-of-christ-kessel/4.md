#### Introduction 概述

In the last chapter we studied the beginning of Jesus' great ministry. From January through March of A.D. 28 he worked in his own backyard, Galilee. However, when the time for the Passover came, once again he made the trip to Jerusalem. As Jesus preached and healed in Jerusalem other Jews were having heated discussions about Jesus. In his teachings and actions Jesus was questioning the center of the corrupted Jewish religion -- obeying the Old Testament Sabbath laws in their smallest details while forgetting their meaning and purpose. By obeying the laws in this way, they thought that they were doing good works that would earn their salvation. After the Passover the Lord returned and resumed his ministry in Galilee. There the complaints were drowned out by the cries of hope and praise. Crowds gathered around the “Good Doctor” to receive help for their illnesses. But Jesus, as he showed in the Sermon on the Mount, had come to give spiritual relief.

在上一章我们学习了耶稣公开传道的开始。从公元28年的1月到3月，耶稣在自己的后院——加利利开展传道等事工。然而，逾越节到了，他又要去耶路撒冷了。因为耶稣在耶路撒冷讲道、医治病人，其他的犹太人热烈地讨论耶稣。耶稣在他的教导和行动中质疑腐坏的犹太教的中心问题——在每个细节中都遵循旧约的安息日律法，而忘记了安息日的真正含义和目的。通过这种方式遵循律法，他们认为是为了得到救赎而做好的事情。逾越节之后，主又回到加利利，重新开始公开传道。在加利利，抱怨的声音被希望和赞美之声淹没。人群都聚集在“好医生”周围，为了他们的病能得到医治。但是正如耶稣在山上的布道中显明的，他来是安慰灵魂的。

#### Miracle at Bethesda （John 5:1-15） 毕士大的神迹（约5:1-15）

After three months of busy mission work, Jesus briefly stopped his ministry to travel to Jerusalem for the Passover. While he was in Jerusalem he went to the pool of Bethesda. The sight must have made him sad. Here a great number of sick and diseased people had gathered beneath the shaded porches. From time to time God would send an angel to stir the waters of the pool. The first person who stepped into the pool was then cured of his disease.

在忙碌的三个月传道之后，耶稣暂时停止讲道，去耶路撒冷过逾越节。在耶路撒冷时，耶稣去了毕士大池。池边的景象一定让耶稣伤心了。大量的生病的和残疾的人聚集在有阴凉的柱子下面。上帝偶尔会差派天使搅动池子里的水。第一个踏进池子里的人，病就得医治。

As Jesus looked at the blind, lame and paralyzed his attention fell upon one person in particular. Through his divine knowledge Jesus knew that this man had been paralyzed for 38 years （longer than the average life expectancy at that time）。 Not only was this man very crippled, but he was also severely depressed. And since he was unable to pull himself into the water after the angel's visit, he had no hope of being cured.

耶稣看到瞎眼的、瘸腿的、瘫痪的，同时他的注意到了一个特别的人。凭借神赐的知识，耶稣知道这个人已经瘫痪38年了（这在当时要比平均寿命的期望值还高）。这人不仅瘫痪得严重，而且非常沮丧。既然在天使光临之后，他无法把自己扔进水里，所以他无望得到医治。

Moved to help, Jesus approached the man and asked what seemed to be a silly question, “Do you want to get well?” （John 5:6）。 This question, however, was Jesus' way of offering help. The crippled man answered that it was impossible for him to be healed unless someone put him in the water at the right moment. Jesus did not respond to this but simply commanded, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.” At once the man was cured. He picked up his mat and walked （John 5:8-9）。

耶稣要帮助他，他来到这个人面前，问了一个看上去很简单的问题，“你要痊愈吗？”（约5:6）。然而这问题正是耶稣要提供帮助的方式。那人回答说除非有人在合适的时候把他丢进水里，否则他不可能痊愈。耶稣对此没有回应，只是简单地命令到：“起来，拿你的褥子走吧。”那人立刻就痊愈了，就拿起褥子来走了（约5:8-9）。

Note two things about this miracle. First think what great power it showed. For 38 years this man had been paralyzed, but after one statement from Christ he was fully restored to normal health. His almost dead muscles were made strong, and immediately he was able to walk. Secondly, there is no evidence that this man believed in Jesus before this meeting. Nevertheless, God filled his heart with trust so that at Christ's command, he tried to do the impossible -- to move muscles he could not feel or control.

在这个神迹中我们要注意两点。首先，想想这显明了什么样的伟大力量。这人已经瘫痪38年，但由基督一句声明之后，他竟然完全恢复成了正常的健康人。他那几乎坏死的肌肉强壮有力，而且立刻就能走了。第二，在遇到耶稣之前没有证据表明这人是信耶稣的。尽管如此，上帝让信充满他的心，以至于基督发出命令时，他试着去做看似不可能的事——移动他无法感知和控制的肌肉。

The man was healed and later worshiped God in the temple. There Jesus gave him with a word of warning, “Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you” （John 5:14）。 In an instant Jesus showed the man the sins of his past, showed him forgiveness, and warned him of eternal damnation.

这人痊愈后就到圣殿中敬拜上帝。在圣殿里耶稣给他一句警告：“不要再犯罪，恐怕你遭遇的更加利害”（约5:14）。耶稣立即指出这个人他以前犯的罪、向他显明耶稣的饶恕，并且也警告他不要犯罪而落入永久的地狱之中。

#### A Sabbath Controversy （John 5:16-47） 安息日公开辩论（约5:16-47）

Some people immediately became upset by Jesus' show of compassion and power. This was because he had performed this miracle on the Sabbath day. The importance of resting on the Sabbath day went back to God's creation of the world. God created for six days then rested on the seventh （Gen. 2:2-3）。 Later God declared in the Third Commandment that the Sabbath was to be kept holy （Exod. 20:8-11）。 Still later God repeated that work was not to be done on this day （Neh. 13:15; Jer. 17:21）。

耶稣显明了自己的怜悯和大能，这立刻让一些人心烦意乱起来。这是因为耶稣在安息日行了神迹。在安息日休息的重要性可以追溯到上帝创造世界。上帝用六天创造世界，第七天歇了一切的工（创2:2-3）。后来上帝在第三项戒律中宣告将安息日守为圣日（出20:8-11）。后来上帝重复强调这日不可做工（尼13:15;耶17:21）。

What did the Old Testament mean when it commanded rest on the Sabbath day? First of all, it meant people should rest from their normal daily work. People were not to carry anything to or from their fields, or bring anything into the city to be sold. In the second place the Sabbath was to be a symbol of the spiritual rest which would come through the promised Messiah （cf. Matt. 11:28-29）。 While awaiting the Savior, the people were to use the Sabbath to think about God's many blessings, to worship him, to praise him, and to study his word.

旧约要求人们在安息日休息是什么意思呢？首先，表示人们应该从日常工作中退出来休息。不得带东西出入田中，或者带东西去城里卖。其次，安息日是那由弥赛亚带来的灵魂休息的标志（太11:28-29）。在等待救世主到来期间，人们通过安息日思考上帝的诸多祝福，敬拜他，称颂他，学习他的话语。

Unfortunately, by Jesus' time, the true meaning of the Sabbath had been lost. To the Pharisees the Sabbath meant obeying a long list of laws and rules. They invented laws to control how much a person could lift on the Sabbath, and how much he could eat and drink. The laws became silly. One said that on the Sabbath a person could go outdoors wearing two shoes, but to go walking with only one was breaking the law. On the Sabbath a man could carry a loaf of bread, but two men might not carry it between them.

不幸的是，在耶稣的时代，安息日的真正意义已经没有了。对于法利赛人来说，安息日意味着遵守长长的、一系列的律法和规则。他们自己创造律法，控制一个人在安息日可以拿多少东西，以及可以吃喝多少。律法在此变得很愚蠢。有人说在安息日一个人可以穿着两双鞋出门，但如果穿着一双鞋子去散步就违反律法了。在安息日一个人可以带一片面包，但是两个人之间不能带。

In the eyes of the jealous Pharisees Jesus had twice broken the Sabbath. First he had done work on the Sabbath by healing the paralyzed man. Secondly he had ordered the man to work by carrying his bed home. Thus began a serious struggle between the Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus Christ, and those who had corrupted the Sabbath, the religious leaders of the people.

在留心提防的法利赛人眼中，耶稣两次违反了安息日的律法。第一次，他在安息日做工，医治了瘫痪的人。第二次，他命令这个瘫子拿着自己的床回家。因此，在安息日的主——耶稣基督和那些已经破坏了安息日原本意义的宗教领袖之间，开始了一场严肃的征战。

The Jewish leaders now accused Jesus of breaking the Sabbath law. If he was found guilty, he should have been killed; the people should throw stones at him until he was dead （Num. 15:32-36）。 Jesus gave a logical and spiritual defense. He argued that God the Father worked every day for mankind, so naturally the Son of God also works on the Sabbath. To the Jews this statement was blasphemous. Jesus was making himself equal to God.

现在犹太教的领导者指责耶稣违反安息日律法。如果他被发现有罪，他应该被杀死，人们应该朝他扔石头直到打死他（民15:32-36）。对此耶稣给出了合乎逻辑、属灵的防卫。他表明天父上帝每一天都为人做工，所以上帝的儿子自然也要在安息日做工。对于犹太人来说，这样的言辞陈述是对上帝的亵渎。耶稣是在把自己等同于上帝。

Jesus is equal to God. He argued that this equality was his Father's doing. The Father put into Jesus' hands the matters of life and death and judgment. Thus, he deserved equal honor with the Father, and, on the other hand, “He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.” （John 5:23）。 The Jews did not have to take Jesus' word for this. John, a man moved by God, testified concerning Jesus as did the Father himself. All of Scripture testifies that Jesus was God's Son. But the Jews did not listen to Jesus' words.

耶稣确实是等同于上帝。他坚持说这种等同性是他父亲所设定的。上帝将生死和审判的事交托在耶稣手中。因此，他配得与上帝一样的荣耀，另一方面，“不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差他来的父。”（约5:23）。犹太人不必相信耶稣的这番话。而约翰，被上帝感召的人，为此做了见证，正如天父自己所说的一样。所有经文都证明了耶稣是上帝的儿子。但是犹太人不听耶稣的这些话。

#### Another Sabbath Controversy （Matt. 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28: Luke 6:1-5） 另一次安息日辩论（太12:1-8）；可2:23-28;路6:1-5）

After celebrating the Passover Jesus and his disciples headed home. As they walked along some Pharisees joined them looking for any excuse to condemn him. Their chance came on another Sabbath day.

庆祝完逾越节之后，耶稣和门徒就往家里返了。沿途中一些法利赛人加入进来，想要找借口谴责耶稣。在另外一个安息日，他们的机会来了。

That day Jesus' disciples walked through a wheat field, picking some grain, separating the seed and eating it. The Pharisees did not accuse the disciples of stealing. They were merely satisfying their need for food, something allowed by Mosaic Law （Deut. 23:25）。 However, the disciples were accused of working on the Sabbath （reaping and threshing）。 The Pharisees held Jesus responsible for their actions.

这一天耶稣的门徒走过一片麦地，拾取了一些麦穗，剥开吃了。法利赛人不指责门徒偷盗。他们只是满足一下对食物的需要，这是摩西律法所允许的（申23:25）。然而，门徒被指责的是在安息日做工（收割和打谷）。法利赛人认为耶稣应该为他们的行动负责。

When confronted by the Pharisees Jesus gave a sharp reply. First he directed them to an example set by King David. David had once eaten the bread in the Lord's tabernacle, even though this was not proper. Nevertheless, the need of the moment was more important, so no one ever condemned David （1 Sam. 21:1-6）。 In Jesus' case it was not just a case of need being more important than following man-made laws. Jesus was the “Lord of the Sabbath” （Luke 6:5）。 Because he was God's Son he had the right as God to do away with Old Testament rules.

在与法利赛人对质时，耶稣给出了一个犀利的答复。首先，耶稣讲了一个大卫王的例子。大卫曾经吃了主帐幕里的面包，虽然这是不合适的。然而，那一刻的需求更重要，因此没有人指责大卫（撒上21:1-6）。在耶稣的这个事例中，这并仅仅是需求比遵行人制定的律法更重要的问题。耶稣是“安息日的主”（路6:5）。因为他是上帝的儿子，他和上帝一样有权利不受律法的制约或捆绑。

#### A Third Sabbath Controversy （Matt. 12:9-14; Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11） 第三次安息日辩论（太12:9-14;可3:1-6;路6:6-11）

The third dispute took place on another Sabbath day. This time Jesus was teaching in a synagogue. The Scribes and Pharisees this time tried to trap Jesus. There was a man present with a withered right hand. Would Jesus heal him on the Sabbath day? The rules of the Pharisees kept a doctor from helping anyone on the Sabbath unless it was a matter of life and death.

第三次争论发生在另外一个安息日。这次耶稣正在会堂里教训人。文士和法利赛人这次想要设陷阱诱导耶稣。在会堂里有一个人的右手枯干了。在安息日耶稣会医治他妈？在安息日，除非是生死攸关的事儿，否则法利赛人的律法不让医生医治任何人。

Jesus, knowing their hearts, reminded them that if a man's sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath he would save the animal. Then, turning to the Pharisees and Scribes, he asked this question, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” （Mark 3:4）。 They said nothing. What Jesus meant was obvious. While the Lord said that some things should not be done on the Sabbath, he had not forbidden every action. God never intended to keep people from doing good deeds. But the idea of mercy never entered the minds of these religious leaders.

耶稣知道他们的心思，提醒他们说，如果一只羊在安息日掉进坑里，主人一定会救羊的。然后，耶稣转向法利赛人和文士，问他们说：“在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，哪样是可以的呢？”（可3:4）。他们都不做声。耶稣的意思是明显的。主说在安息日有些事不可做时，他并没有禁止每一件事。上帝永远不会故意阻止人们好的行为。但是怜悯的意念无法进入到这些宗教领袖的里面。

So without waiting Jesus healed the man. Immediately the men who had argued with Jesus became his worst enemies. Because they hated Jesus, they began to make plans against him with their other enemies. Before this the patriotic and nationalistic Pharisees hated the Herodians. The Herodians were willing to cooperate with the Romans. Nevertheless, they now joined together and made plans to murder Jesus, a man of mercy.

所以没有等耶稣治愈手枯干的人。与耶稣争论的那人立刻就成了他最大的敌人。因为他们憎恨耶稣，他们开始和其他敌对耶稣的人计划如何反对他。此前，那些爱国也好不爱国也好的法利赛人憎恨那些效忠希律一世的人。希律一世愿意与罗马人合作。然而，现在他们结合到一起，计划杀掉耶稣，这个有怜悯的人。

This angry reaction against Jesus is not too surprising. After all, they thought that Jesus was threatening their religion. The Pharisees taught that man can save himself. Jesus, on the other hand, taught that man cannot save himself but that salvation is a gift of God through himself, the Son of God.

这种反对耶稣的怒气反应并不足为奇。毕竟他们认为耶稣正威胁着他们的宗教信仰。法利赛人教导人们自己拯救自己。而耶耶稣的教导是：人不能自救，救赎是上帝通过耶稣、上帝的儿子给人的礼物。

#### Mission Work in Galilee （Matt. 12:15-21; Mark 3:7-12） 在加利利传道（太12:15-21;可3:7-12）

Although Christ was now hated by the Jewish religious leaders, he was more popular than ever with the common people. Jesus and the disciples went again to the Sea of Galilee. Many people from Judea, Idumaea, Galilee and the area of Tyre and Sidon came in crowds to see Jesus with their own eyes and to have him heal their diseases.

现在虽然基督被犹太教领袖所憎恨，但在平民当中他比以前更受欢迎了。耶稣和门徒再次来到加利利海。很多人从犹大、以东、加利利以及推罗和西顿一带，来到加利利要亲眼看到耶稣，让耶稣医治他们的病痛。

Jesus was filled with mercy. He did heal the sick and throw out demons. As the evil spirits left their victims they called Jesus the “Son of God,” the Messiah （Mark 3:11）。 But Jesus ordered them to be silent. The Savior wanted to be acknowledged by men, not by defeated and scared demons. And many in the crowd did believe in Jesus. They found him to be the one spoken of in Isaiah （42:14）。

耶稣充满怜悯。他医治有病的人，赶出魔鬼。在邪灵离开被附的人时，他们称耶稣为“神的儿子”,弥赛亚（可3:11）。但耶稣吩咐他们不要声张。救世主想想要被人熟知，而不是被击败和慌张的魔鬼所熟知。会众中人多人信了耶稣。他们发现耶稣就是以赛亚书中所说的那人（42:14）。

Before we leave this part of Christ's life one other question must be answered. Why did the people continue to rush to Jesus even after he had been totally rejected by their religious leaders? The answer is quite simple. While religious leaders saw Jesus as a rival, some of the people believed Jesus' claim to be the Messiah. Others saw him as a political savior, a messenger from God who would heal their diseases, give them all they needed for their daily life, and, in time, throw out the hated Romans.

在我们结束耶稣这段生活之前，必须要解决另外一个问题。为什么人们不断地涌向耶稣面前，即使是在他已经完全被宗教领袖们排斥之后？答案很简单。虽然宗教领袖看耶稣为异己，还是有些人相信耶稣所宣告的——弥赛亚。其余的人则把耶稣看为争夺权力的救主，从上帝而来的信使、医治他们的疾病，供给他们日常生活的所需，同时也抵制他们所憎恨的罗马人。

#### Appointing the Twelve Apostles （Matt 10:2-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16） 设立十二使徒（太10:2-4;可3:13-19;路6:12-16）

0ne evening in the spring of A.D. 28 Jesus went for a walk. Leaving Capernaum he hiked to a mountain top where he could be alone and pray all night long.

在公元28年春天的一个傍晚，耶稣出去散步。离开迦百农之后耶稣隐藏在山顶，在这儿他可以独处，并且整夜祷告。

As he talked to his Father he was thinking about a big decision he had to make. The time had come to choose a dozen men who would become his students. They would be with him, learn from his words, carry his message to many other people. After Jesus went to heaven, these followers would lead and spread his church on earth.

在他与天父交谈时，正在考虑他必须要做的一项重要决定。是时候选择12个使徒成为他的学生了。他们会跟从耶稣，学习他的话语，把他的福音传给更多的人。耶稣回到天国后，这些跟随者也能够引领并扩大地上的教会。

Jesus reached his decision. He now chose 12 men as his special apostles. He had already called Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Nathanael （Bartholomew）， and Matthew. Now he added Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus （Lebbaeus, Judas）， Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

耶稣最终做了决定。现在他选择了12个人做他的特别使徒。他已经呼召了彼得、安得烈、雅各、约翰、腓力、拿但业（巴多罗买）。再加上多马、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、达太（，犹大）、奋锐党西门、加略人犹大。

#### Sermon on the Mount （Matt. 5:1; 7:29; Luke 6:17-49） 在山上讲道（太5:1;7:29;路6:17-49）

By the time Jesus had completed calling “The Twelve” a large crowd had gathered. Jesus found a level place on the mountain and there preached the sermon we now call the Sermon on the Mount. This, the longest sermon of Jesus in the Bible, was a message for those who already believed in him. Thus, his purpose was not to bring them to faith, but to outline what it meant to follow him.

耶稣呼召完“十二”门徒时，很多人已经聚集起来。耶稣在山上找到一处平地讲道，就是现在我们称为登山宝训的。这是圣经中耶稣最长的一次讲道，是对于那些已经信耶稣的人所传讲的讯息。因此，他的目的不是带领他们信主，而是概述了要跟从他意味着什么。

In his sermon Jesus discussed two main subjects: the believer's relationship to God and his relationship to other people. The Savior mixed these two subjects together as he taught about everything from prayer to charity, from judging to divorce. The whole time he kept emphasizing that faith is a matter of the heart, not of going through outward actions.

耶稣在讲道中讨论了两个主题：信徒与上帝的关系、信徒与其他人的关系。救世主在教导中将这两个主题混合起来，从祷告到怜恤，从论断到休妻。在这段时间里耶稣一直强调信是关乎人的内心的事，而不在乎外在的行为。

#### The Beatitudes 八福

Jesus' sermon opened with the statements which we call the “Beatitudes”. The word “beatitude” comes from the Latin word that means “blessed,” the first word in each statement. Only believers have the spiritual gift of being blessed. In the first four beatitudes Jesus discussed the connection between believers and God. In the last four he taught about how believers were to act towards other humans. This is similar to the two parts of the Ten Commandments.

耶稣的讲道以我们称之为“八福”的陈述开始。“八福”这个词来源于拉丁文，意思是“享受天国之福的”,出现在每个陈述的第一个字。只有信徒才有这种被祝福的属灵礼物。前面四个讲的是信徒和上帝之间的关系。后面四个教导是关于信徒应该如何对待其他人的。这与十诫的两个部分相似。

1. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The poor in spirit are those people who are aware that they are spiritually poor. They know that they have nothing to offer God, that they are full of sin. They feel unworthy of God's blessings. They are the ones who will enjoy the gifts of God.

    虚心的人有福了。虚心的人是指那些意识到他们在属灵上的贫乏。他们知道自己没有什么可以给上帝，他们充满了罪。他们觉得不配上帝的祝福。他们正是将要享有上帝礼物的人。

2. Blessed are those who mourn. These are the people who are distressed because of their sin. They know that sin separates them from God. Yet they will be assured of God's love and forgiveness.

    哀恸的人有福了。这是指因为罪而哀伤的人。他们知道罪使他们与神隔绝。然而他们必将拥有上帝的爱和饶恕。

3. Blessed are the meek. These are the Christians who realize their proper place before God and wish to do his will. They will benefit from the earth, for all things will work for their good both now and in the next life.

    温柔的人有福了。是指在上帝面前知道自己合适位置的基督徒，并希望按照上帝的旨意行事。他们在地上的日子获益，因为万事都叫他们在今时到以后都得益处。

4. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. These are the people who eagerly wish and try to be holy as God wishes them to be. They will, through faith in Jesus Christ, be declared holy by God.

    饥渴慕义的人有福了。这是指那些渴慕并且试着过上帝所期望的圣洁的生活。借着耶稣基督他们被上帝称圣。

5. Blessed are the merciful. Those Christians are filled with love for all humans. They will obtain mercy.

    怜恤的人有福了。是指那些对全人类充满爱的基督徒。他们也同样会得到怜恤。

6. Blessed are the pure in heart. These are the people who honestly say what they believe in their hearts. Like Adam before the fall, they will one day see God, face to face.

    清心的人有福了。是指那些诚实地说出他们内心所信的。正如亚当落入罪中之前，他们有一天会见到上帝，与上帝面对面。

7. Blessed are the peacemakers. They strive for harmony and try to live in peace with everyone and everything. They are God's children because they are living like their heavenly Father.

    使人和睦的人有福了。他们为和谐而奋斗，试图与每个人和平相处。他们是上帝的孩子，因为他们像天父一样生活。

8. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness. Such people are willing to be disliked, dishonored, abused, or suffer in any way because of their faith. They will be honored and accepted in God's Kingdom.

    为义受逼迫的人有福了。这样的人为了他们的信仰，甘愿被人们厌弃、侮辱、虐待或者忍受任何形式的逼迫。在上帝的国度里他们将被尊敬和接纳。

Thus Jesus first taught that true religion was a matter of what was inside （what is in the heart, the gifts promised and provided by God）。 Jesus now went on to condemn how the Pharisees put their trust in outward actions. We are all self-righteous people. They put their trust in their own actions and are only concerned with how they are viewed by other people. Their reward for being only concerned about what others think is soon gone.

因此耶稣首先教导说，真正的信仰是关于内在的（在人的内心，是上帝应许的、也是由上帝而来的礼物）。耶稣现在继续谴责法利赛人是如何把他们的信建立在外在的行为上的。我们都是自以为是的人。他们将信放在自己的行为上，而且只关心别人如何看待自己。他们的奖赏，因为只关注在别人如何看待他们上面，所以很快就没有了。

People with faith in their hearts have a very important role to play in the world. They are, and must remain, salt and light. Salt is used to preserve food; as a seasoning it adds flavor. It is also necessary for the body to live. In the same way Christians bring decency and order to our dying world. In this way Christians help to preserve it. And it doesn't take many Christians to have a good effect on society. But Christians are not to remain a hidden force. They are to make their presence known. They are to light up the world's darkness. They are to be lights of hope for all to see.

将信仰放在内心深处的人在世上的这场戏剧中扮演非常重要的角色。他们是盐和光，而且必须要保持下去。盐用来保存食物；作为调味品，盐增加味道。盐也是人体生命的必须品。同样，基督徒为我们将死的世界带来正直和秩序。这样基督徒帮助人们保存它。而这并没有让很多基督徒在社会上有好的影响。但基督徒是只保留隐藏的力量。他们现在要让人们知道他们。他们要照亮世界的黑暗。他们是所有人能看到的希望之光。

At this point in his sermon, Christ became more personal. He briefly spoke of his role as the Messiah. He came not to fight Rome, but to fulfill the Scriptures （Law and Prophets） for man's credit. When Christ perfectly obeyed the Law he did not do it by just outwardly obeying it. He obeyed because of his pure heart.

在讲道中，所有这些要点，基督都变得更个性化了。他简单地谈到作为弥赛亚他的职分。他来不是为了攻击罗马人，而是要为了人类的信用完成旧约中提到的使命（律法和预言）。当基督完美地遵行律法时，他并不只是外在地遵行。他遵行律法是因为他有一颗单纯的心。

His followers must also be concerned with their hearts. They must realize that murder develops from anger, and adultery comes from lust. The Law was written to protect our neighbor's body and marriage. Truth is truth; lie is lie. People should not need to take oaths, but if they do they should keep them. Revenge is also a sin that has roots in man's heart. The desire for revenge must be replaced by understanding and love. In all things the example of God should fill the heart of the disciple: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” （Matt. 5:48）。

他的信徒也必须关注他们的内心。他们必须意识到，杀戮由怒气而生，奸淫出于肉欲。律法写出来是为了保护我们身体的洁净和婚姻的。真理是真理；谎言是谎言。人们不必发誓，但如果发誓就应该遵行誓言。报复也是深植人心的罪。想要报复的那种欲望必须由理解和爱来代替。上帝在诸事上的模范样子应该充满使徒的心：“所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样”（太5:48）。

A pure heart shows itself in a truly Christian life and heart. Acts of holiness should not be done to impress people. Rather they should be done quietly. This applies to giving offerings, praying, and fasting.

Believers should always keep their minds on God's kingdom. Loving possessions and luxury leads to greed and constant worry.

清心呈现在一位真正的基督徒的生活和内心中。神圣的行为不应该是为了给人们留下深刻的印象。这种事应该行在暗处。这同样适用于奉献、祷告和禁食。

信徒应该将心思意念放在神的国度上。对财产和享乐的喜爱导致贪婪和不断的忧虑。

As we have seen, Jesus in his sermon mixed these two thoughts. The disciple's heart must be in proper relationship to God and to his fellow man. Jesus was still teaching these same things at the end of his sermon. He taught that believers do not judge hearts. They do not allow the holy things of God to be treated as unclean. Believers speak from their hearts to God through prayer, and he blesses them with the best things. When disciples are faced with false prophets they maintain God's Word in its truth and purity.

正如我们所看到的，耶稣在他的讲道中混合了这两个想法。对于使徒同上帝和同伴的关系，他们必须摆正心态。耶稣在讲道结尾的部分又教导了同样的事情。他教导说，信徒不要论断人的心。他们不允许上帝的圣事被视为不洁净。信徒通过祷告将他们对上帝的信表达出来，而且上帝给他们最好的祝福。当使徒面对假先知的时候，他们仍能保持上帝的真理和完全。

Finally, Jesus wanted the crowd to understand that his words were not just fine sayings that made good sense. They were the words of truth, the words of God, which must be obeyed.

最后，耶稣想要会众们明白，他所讲的这些不只是有道理的好听的话而已。而是有关真理的话，是我们必须要遵行的上的话。

As the people left the mountain that day they were “amazed” （Matt. 7:28）。 Unlike the Scribes, Jesus had not given a talk about small issues. He had taken divine truth and showed what it meant in their everyday lives. He had ended some of their greatest doubts. In the days ahead they would try to sort out the meaning of every statement and how it fit into the rest of his teachings.

那天会众离开山的时候他们“稀奇”（太7:28）。与文士不同，耶稣所讲到的不是小事。他讲的是神圣的真理，并表明这在基督徒的日常生活中的意义。耶稣解决了他们最大的疑惑。未来他们会试着整理每一个陈述的意思，也会发现它是如何与耶稣其他的教导融合到一起的。
