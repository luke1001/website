#### Introduction  简介

It was now Friday, April 7, A.D. 30, the day of Jesus' greatest sufferings, his trials, and his execution on the cross. We most often refer to this day as Good Friday. It was a good, yes even a great and glorious day for the world. For it was the day when Christ paid the price for the sins of all mankind and earned salvation for every soul.

时间回到公元30年，4月7日，星期五。在这一天，耶稣要经历伟大的苦难，接受审判，并死在十字架上。我们常常称这天为“受难日”,这一天是美好的，对世界而言甚至是伟大和荣耀的。因为这一天耶稣为全人类的罪付上了代价，并为每一个灵魂带来了拯救。

#### Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane （Matt 26:30,36-46; Mark 14:26,32-42; Luke 22:39-46; John 18:1） 在客西马尼园里痛苦异常 （马太福音26:30,36-46;马可福音14:26,32-42;路加福音22:39-46;约翰福音18:1）

Late on Thursday Jesus and his disciples left the room where they had finished eating the Passover meal. They then walked out of Jerusalem, crossed the brook Kidron, and climbed the gentle slopes of the Mount of Olives where they entered a garden known as Gethsemane. Jesus' greatest struggle began in a garden just like Adam and Eve's greatest suffering began in another garden – Eden.

星期四晚些时候，耶稣和他的门徒们吃完了逾越节的晚宴，就离开了那个房间。随后，他们从耶路撒冷出来，穿过汲沦溪谷，走上橄榄山的缓坡并进入被称作客西马尼的橄榄园中。耶稣在园子里经受了内心极大的挣扎，这让人想起当初亚当和夏娃在另一个园子——伊甸园里所经历的恐慌。

That Passover night there was almost a full moon, but the olive trees made the garden darker with their shadows. But there was a greater darkness which had fallen upon the world. There was a darker enemy than Judas who was on his way to the Garden. Satan, the Prince of Darkness, also came to tempt Jesus. He gathered his forces for an attack upon the second Adam, Jesus. He tried to get Christ to fall just as he had gotten Adam and Eve to sin in the Garden of Eden.

逾越节的晚上皓月当空，但是茂密的橄榄树让整个园子笼罩在巨大的阴影中。除此之外，正有一个更大的黑暗笼罩着这个世界。一个比犹大更黑暗的敌人将来到客西马尼园中。撒旦，黑暗之子也来到这里试探耶稣。他蓄势待发，要攻击这末后的亚当——耶稣。他试图使耶稣像亚当和夏娃在伊甸园中犯罪一样被击垮。

Jesus left eight disciples at the entrance to the garden and took Peter, James, and John farther inside. They had seen Jesus in his full glory on the Mount of Transfiguration. Now they would see him in his great struggle and sadness. Jesus said to them, “My soul is overcome with sorrow to the point of death . . . Stay here and keep watch” （Mark 14:34）。

耶稣让八个门徒留在园子的入口，并带着彼得、雅各和约翰往园子深处走去。这三个人已经在耶稣登山变相时见过他的威荣。现在他们要看到的是耶稣极大地挣扎和哀伤。耶稣对他们说：“我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死，你们在这里等候、警醒。” （马可福音14:34）。

A great sorrow caused Jesus to throw himself to the ground and resulted in a sweat like blood （Luke 22:44）。 This sorrow was produced by three unholy terrors. First, the eternal Son of God faced a condition totally strange to himself – his own death. Second, his death was a substitute for others. He would have to bear all men's sins on his own shoulders and feel the full fury of God's justice. In the garden he was already accepting this load. Finally, Satan was given freedom to try to scare Jesus into sinning. While all this was happening, the disciples slept. Rather than judging the disciples too harshly, we would do well to examine the reason for their slumbers. He found them very tired because of their sorrow （Luke 22:45）。 Their spirits were willing to obey Jesus （Mark 14:38）， but their bodies were totally out of energy.

巨大的哀伤使耶稣俯伏在地，汗滴如大血点一样滴在地上（路加福音22:44）。这样的忧伤源于三种来自于人性的恐惧。首先，上帝永恒的儿子要面对一种前所未有的局面——他自己的死亡。其次，他是为别人而死。他将要独自承受所有人的罪和全然感受因上帝公义而来的列怒。在客西马尼园中，他已经预备好领受这一切。最后，撒旦任由己意妄图恐吓耶稣以使他犯罪。当这一切发生的时候，他的门徒们都睡着了。我们不应过于严厉地论断这些门徒们，但是可以好好地探究一下他们睡着的原因。耶稣发现他们因为忧愁而过于疲倦（路加福音22:45）。他们的灵固然愿意顺服耶稣（马可福音14:38），他们的肉体却软弱了。

#### Good Friday  受难日

At long last, in the early hours of Good Friday, Jesus reported, “The time has come” （Mark 14:41）。 The right time about which Jesus had so often spoken had now arrived. The two opposing forces would now meet in battle: Jesus and Satan.

最后，在受难日的最初几个小时，耶稣对他们说：“时候到了”（马可福音14:41）。这个耶稣曾多次提到的时刻终于来到了。正邪之间将进行最后的对决：耶稣和撒旦。

#### Jesus Betrayed and Arrested （Matt. 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:2-12） 耶稣被出卖并被捕（马太福音26:47-56;马可福音14:43-52;路加福音22:47-53;约翰福音18:2-12）

Jesus suffered mental and spiritual grief in the garden. Soon his physical struggle and suffering would begin. Judas entered the garden leading a group of Roman soldiers armed with swords and Jewish leaders and temple guards carrying clubs. Judas showed which man they soldiers should arrest by going up to the Son of God and kissing him. This was the worst act of betrayal in human history.

在客西马尼园中耶稣经历了心灵的苦痛。不久之后，等待他的将是身体上的折磨和痛苦。犹大来到园中，一队佩剑的罗马士兵、犹太领袖和手持棍棒的差役跟在他的后面。犹大通过亲吻耶稣，向士兵们示意他就是他们要上前逮捕的耶稣，上帝的独生子。这就是人类历史上最令人不耻的背叛。

Jesus did not normally use his divine power while on earth except to heal or help people. This time, however, his power threw the mob to the ground. Then Jesus surrendered self. In this was he indicated that he was willing to be arrested and suffer. But the disciples did not understand what Jesus was doing. Peter grabbed his sword and struck one of the soldiers, cutting off the man's ear. Jesus healed the ear, again showing that he was peacefully going with the men and did not want to cause a bloody fight

除了曾用神圣的能力医治和帮助人们外，在世上耶稣没有理所当然地使用它们。然而这一次耶稣用这样的能力，让前来抓捕他的人们倒退着倒在了地上。随后他就放弃了抵抗。这些都表明他是自愿被捕、承受痛苦的。但是他的门徒们无法理解耶稣所做的一切。彼得拿着他的匕首攻击了其中的一个士兵，并切掉了他的耳朵。耶稣随后治愈了受伤的士兵，再一次显示出他想要跟着他们平静地离开，而不希望看到一场血战。

After Jesus was arrested, the disciples, along with an unnamed young man, fled. Since the latter is mentioned only in Mark's Gospel account, it is thought that this man was Mark.

耶稣被捕后，他的门徒们和一个不知名的年轻人都逃跑了。因为这个细节只被记录在路加福音中，因此猜测这个年轻人可能就是马可。

#### Trial by the Jews （Matt. 26:57--27:1; Mark 14:53-15:1; Luke 22:54-71; John 18:13-27） 被犹太领袖审判（马太福音26:57-27:1;马可福音14:53-15:1;路加福音22:54-71;约翰福音18:13-27）

Before beginning a study of Jesus' trials before the religious leaders, we should remember that several times earlier he had prophesied about the events that would now happen.

在了解耶稣被宗教领袖审判之前，我们应回忆起，此前他曾多次预言到即将发生的这些事情。

If we put all six of these prophecies together it would read like this:

如果我们把所有这六次预言放在一起读，我们将会看到这些：

Destroy the temple of my body and I will raise it again in three days. But before this I must go to Jerusalem and be betrayed into the hands of men. You disciples will be scattered. I must suffer many things at the hands of the Jewish religious leaders. They will condemn me to death and turn me over to the Gentiles. They will mock, spit on, beat, and crucify me. On the third day I will be raised to life.

毁掉我身体的殿，我将会三天内再建起来。但是在这之前，我必须去耶路撒冷，被交在人的手里。你们作为我的门徒，将要四散而逃。我必须在犹太宗教领袖那里忍受许多的苦。他们要定我的死罪并会把我交在外邦人手中。他们会嘲弄我，用吐沫吐我，打我，将我钉在十字架上。在第三天我会死而复活。

After his arrest Jesus was taken to the house of the high priest, Caiaphas. Soon some members of the Jewish council （Sanhedrin） gathered to judge him. As he had prophesied, Jesus suffered many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the Law. He was blindfolded, hit, and spit on. Then this court condemned him to death. His crime was claiming to be the Son of God. Since his claim was true, there was really no crime at all.

耶稣被捕后被带到了大祭司该亚法的家中。没多久，一些犹太议会（公会）的成员聚集在那里开始审问他。就像他曾预言的，耶稣在长老，祭司长，文士们的手下受了很多苦。他们蒙上他的眼睛打他，朝他身上吐口水。随后这个裁判庭认定他该受死罪。他的罪行是宣称自己是上帝的儿子。因为他宣称的是事实，他显然是清白的。

When Jesus said that he was the Christ, he added, “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven” （Mark 14:62）。 What did Jesus mean? For the moment these religious leaders were his judges, but one day he would be their Judge. They might kill his earthy body, but he would one day decide where these leaders would spend eternity.

当耶稣说他就是基督时，他补充说：“你们必看见人子，坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临（马可福音14:62）”.耶稣说的是什么意思呢？在那个时刻，这些宗教的领袖可以审判耶稣，但是有一天他们将要被耶稣审判。他们可以杀死耶稣在世上的身体，但是有一天耶稣将是决定这些人在哪里度过他们来生的那个人。

Since the Jewish council could not legally conduct business at night, they met again at daybreak to confirm the decision of their secret night meeting. They condemned Christ. He was guilty of blasphemy, a crime with the penalty of death. However, while the Roman government allowed the Jews to punish small crimes themselves, they were not permitted to put anyone to death. Only a Roman court could execute someone. Thus, according to Jesus' prophecy, the Jews turned him over to the Gentile Romans.

犹太议会在夜里商议事情是非法的，因此他们在破晓的时候再次聚在一起，明确了他们在夜里秘密商议的决定。他们定了耶稣的罪。耶稣亵渎了神明，罪当处死。然而，因为罗马政府允许犹太人自己惩罚轻微的犯罪行为，却不允许他们处死任何人。只有罗马法庭才能执行死刑。因此，如耶稣所预言的一样，犹太人讲耶稣交到了罗马人这些异教徒手中。

While Jesus was being tried by the religious leaders, in a near-by courtyard Peter was also on trial. People there were accusing him of being a disciple of Jesus. Three times he pleaded not guilty. When the rooster crowed for the second time Peter remembered Jesus' earlier warning, “before the rooster crows twice you yourself will deny me three times.” Then he broke down and wept （Mark 14:30,72）。

当耶稣正在被宗教领袖审问时，在附近的一个园子里，彼得同样经受着试炼。在那里的人们指认他是耶稣的一个门徒。他三次否认了他们的指控。当鸡叫第二次的时候，彼得想起来耶稣早些时候曾警告他说：“鸡叫两遍以先，你要三次不认我。（马可福音14:30,72）”想到这些，彼得忍不住哭了。

#### Trial by the Gentiles （Matt. 27:2, 11-30; Mark 15:1-19; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:28-19:16）  被交在外邦人手中（马太福音27:2,11-30;马可福音15:1-19;路加福音23:1-25;约翰福音18:28-19:16）

The Jews condemned Jesus for religious reasons. When they brought him before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, they changed their charges. Since Pilate would not be interested in religious issues, Jesus was charged with political crimes.

犹太人因为宗教的理由定了耶稣的罪。当他们把耶稣带到罗马官员本丢彼拉多面前时，他们改变了之前的指控。因为彼拉多并不关心宗教问题，所以耶稣被指控犯有政治罪。

During the course of the trial, just as he predicted, Jesus was mocked, spit on, flogged and [as we will see shortly] crucified by the Gentiles. The Jewish guards had mocked and beaten Jesus because he was the Messiah. The Roman soldiers did the same to Jesus because he was a king.

就像耶稣曾预示的一样，在他经受审讯的同时，他被嘲笑，人们吐口水在他身上，他被鞭打，并且（我们将要马上谈到）被异教徒钉在十字架上。犹太守卫因为他自称是弥赛亚而嘲弄击打他。罗马兵丁们也因为耶稣自称是犹太人的王做了同样的事。

Pilate, in spite of all his failings, was not easy to fool. He could see that Jesus was innocent and that the Jews were jealous of him. So he tried to refer the case to King Herod. Then he had Jesus beaten, hoping that the Jews would pity him. When that failed, he threatened to release a violent criminal named Barabbas. But the Jews would not take “no” for an answer. They got their way by threats. While Pilate was washing his hands of the whole matter the Jews cried out, “Let his blood be on us and on our children” （Matt. 27:25）。

尽管彼拉多曾经有很多的失败，但是却不是那么容易被愚弄。他知道耶稣是无罪的，他也看出犹太人嫉妒他。所以彼拉多曾尝试将这个烫手的山芋教给希律王。随后他毒打了耶稣，希望借此能够使犹太人有些恻隐之心。当这些都失败后，他威胁要释放一个叫巴拉巴的暴徒。但是犹太人没有否定这个提议。他们得到了想要的，也为此付出了代价。当彼拉多为这所发生的一切在众人面前洗手，表明他与此无关时，犹太人门喊着：“他的血归到我们和我们的子孙身上。”（马太福音27:25）

#### Judas' Suicide （Matt. 27:3-10） 犹大自杀（马太福音27:3-10）

The tragic case of Judas Iscariot is a good reminder that where sin remains unforgiven, man has no inner peace. In spite of the 30 silver coins in his purse, the weight of God's Law （Deut. 27:25） pressed down heavily on him. Even confessing his wrong and returning the money could not bring him peace. He now decided on suicide.

加略人犹大的悲剧提醒我们，一个人若得不到罪的赦免，他永远得不到内心的平安。尽管三十块钱已经到手，但是上帝的律法使他不堪重负。甚至他忏悔了自己的过错，并将所得的钱如数退还，但这仍旧不能使他得到平安。最后，他选择了自杀。

Meanwhile, there was another man filled with sorrow because of his sins. He was Peter, the one who had denied the Savior three times. It is interesting to see how Peter found the inner peace which Judas wanted so much. But that story will have to wait until the next chapter.

期间，还有另一个人的内心因为罪而充满了愧疚。他就是彼得，三次不认主的彼得。有意思的是，我们可以看到彼得是如何得到犹大无比渴慕的内心平安的。这个故事会在下一个章节中谈到。

#### The Crucifixion （Matt 27:31-56; Mark 15:20-41; Luke 23:26-49; John 19:17-30） 被钉十字架 （马太福音27:31-56;马可福音15:20-41;路加福音23:26-49;约翰福音19:17-30）

The streets on which Jesus walked to the cross is called the Way of Sorrows （Via Dolorosa）。 Leaving the court of Pilate, he was dressed in his own clothes, and a heavy cross was laid on his shoulders. Condemned criminals usually had to carry their own crosses to the execution site. The Lord did carry his cross （more accurately, our cross） as far as his tortured body would allow. Then he collapsed. The soldiers then made a pilgrim named Simon carry the cross the rest of the way.

耶稣走向十字架所路过的街道被称作“苦路”（Via Dolorosa）。离开彼拉多之后，耶稣穿着他自己的衣服，扛起了沉重的十字架。被定罪的犯人一般要扛着他自己的十字架走到行刑地。主扛着他的十字架（更准确地说，是我们的十字架），拖着他被拷打的身体尽力的向前走，直到他难以为继。士兵们于是勉强一位叫做西门的朝圣者，替耶稣扛十字架走余下的路。

The death march attracted a crowd. Among them were some believing women who began to mourn and wail as was the local custom. However, Jesus would not even allow this expression of sorrow. He encouraged them to look into their own future and see the destruction of their city （A.D. 70）。 Jesus' unselfish warning was his last public speech before his death.

死刑的队伍吸引了很多的人围观。在他们中间，有一群信主的妇女，开始按着当地的习俗哀号。然而，耶稣实际上不认同这样哀伤的表达。他鼓励她们着眼自己的未来，思想他们城市面临的毁灭（公元70年）。耶稣忘我的提醒是他受死前最后一次公开的布道。

At last they came to a skull-shaped hill outside the city wall. There on Golgatha, or Calvary, Jesus was crucified between two criminals. Nails were driven through his wrists and feet, and the cross was stood up. It was 9:00 A.M.

最后她们来到了城墙外面一座骷髅形状的山顶上。就是各各他，或者髑髅地，耶稣在这里被钉在十字架上，在两个罪犯的中间。钉子钉入他的手腕和脚掌，十字架被竖起。时间是当天的上午十点钟。

For the next three hours Jesus suffered the physical pain of crucifixion and mental suffering from the cruel Jewish and Roman spectators. But, Jesus had expected such treatment and the Old Testament prophecies had already described the scene accurately （Ps. 22:1-18; Is. 53:12）。

接下来的三个小时里，耶稣的身体忍受了十字架上极大的痛苦，残忍的犹太人和罗马的旁观者也在折磨着他的意志。但是，耶稣早就预料到这样的情形，旧约的先知们也早已精确地描述过这个场景（诗篇22:1-18;以赛亚书53:12）。 　　　 

It was during these pre-noon hours that Jesus made his first three statements from the cross. In each case he showed true concern, not for himself, but for mankind. He prayed for who had caused his death, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” （Luke 23:34）。 To the repentant criminal on the cross next to him, he made the promise, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise” （Luke 23:43）。 Finally, Jesus gave instant comfort and lasting security to his dear mother bleeding from her very soul （Luke 2:35）。 Referring to his beloved disciple John, Jesus said, “Dear woman, here is your son.” To John he explained “Here is your mother” （John 19:26-27）。

在中午之前的一两个小时内，耶稣在十字架上说了最初的三句话。每一句话都表明他所关心的不是他自己，而是所有的人。他为那些定他死罪的人祷告：“父啊，赦免他们！因为他们所做的，他们不晓得（路加福音23:34）”.对那个钉在他旁边悔改了的罪犯，耶稣给了他一个承诺：“我实在告诉你：今日你要同我在乐园里了（路加福音23:43）”.最后，耶稣深切地安慰了他的妈妈，为她的未来提供了持久的保证，抚平了她心灵深处的创痛。指着他所爱的门徒约翰，耶稣说：“母亲，看你的儿子。”然后又对约翰解释说：“看你的母亲”（约翰福音19:26-27）。

Then at noon darkness fell across the whole earth, lasting for three hours. This sign from heaven quieted the crowd. No one could see Jesus' face during this time, and the Lord was left to himself.

随后在中午的时候，黑暗笼罩了全地，并持续了3个小时之久。这个天上的巨变使人群异常安静。期间没有人看得到耶稣的脸，他孤独的一个人。

We cannot imagine how much pain Jesus suffered during these dark hours. The weight, guilt, and punishment for the sins of all mankind were on him. Suddenly, at 3:00 P.M,. Jesus cried out in a loud voice saying, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” （Matt. 27:46; Ps. 22:1）。 When God the Father withdraws himself from a person, then that person experiences hell （Matt. 25:41）。

我们很难想象在日头变黑的几个小时里，耶稣忍受了多大的痛苦。世上每个人深重的罪孽，他们心里的愧疚和该受的惩罚，如今都在耶稣身上。突然，在下午三点钟，耶稣大声喊着说：“我的神！我的神！为什么离弃我？（马太福音27:46;诗篇22:1）”.当上帝使他自己与一个人隔绝时，那么这个人所经历的就是地狱（马太福音25:41）。

Light then returned to the earth. The three hours of suffering in hell was completed. Jesus then found strength for three final statements.

随后，大地重现光明。三个小时地狱里的苦旅结束了。随后，耶稣打起精神说了最后的三句话。

He said “I am thirsty” （John 19:28） so that the last Old Testament prophecy concerning his death might be fulfilled （Ps. 22:15; Ps. 69:21）。

他说：“我渴了”（约翰福音19:28），由此旧约中最后一个关于他死亡的预言被验证（诗篇22:15;诗篇691:2）。

Once the drink had been given to him, Jesus could say confidently, “It is finished” （John 19:30）。 While his enemies were happy at his defeat, the shout of triumph comes from the lips of Jesus. This word was a report to the Father who had sent him; but it was said in a loud voice so that all men could hear it. With the greatest single word ever spoken, he announced the finish of the work which his Father had given him. Finished was his work of redemption, the work of bringing God and man together again, the work of suffering and dying for all people. The rule of the prince of hell had been broken, and Satan had been crushed under his heel.

当蘸满了醋的海绒被递给他后，耶稣可以安然地说出：“成了”（约翰福音19:30）。当他的敌人们正在为耶稣的失败而欣喜时，耶稣的嘴中大声说出了得胜的宣告。这个宣告是在对差遣他来的天父汇报；但是他用很大的声音说出来，使所有的人都听得到。随着这个伟大的词语被说出来，耶稣宣告天父所交给他的工作已经完成了。他完成了救赎之工，这工作使神与人和好，这受苦和受死的工作是为所有的人而做的。地狱之子的枷锁被打破了，撒旦被踏在耶稣的脚下。

With his mission finished, Jesus now could allow his broken body to die. His last words were, “Father, I give my spirit into your hands.” （Luke 23:46）。

随着耶稣使命的结束，耶稣如今可以允许他破碎的身体死去了。他最后的一句话是：“父啊，我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”（路加福音23:46）。

At that very moment God the Father added his own “amen” to Jesus' perfect death. The Old Testament was closed, the new time of grace had begun. The curtain （as thick as the palm of a man's hand） which sealed off the Most Holy Place in the temple, was torn from top to bottom. This showed that because of Jesus' atoning death all sinner can now approach God. Meanwhile the earth shook. The resurrection was begun as dead believers were made alive. A Roman centurion made a startling discovery: Jesus was “a righteous man… The Son of God” （Luke 23:47; Mark 15:39）。

就在那一刻，天父上帝用他自己的“阿们”回应了耶稣完美的死亡。旧的约终止了，恩典的时期已经开始。圣殿中遮蔽至圣所的幔子（）从上到下裂为两半。这表明因着耶稣的赎罪祭，所有的罪人现在可以亲近上帝了。这期间，地大震动。已死的信徒被赋予生命，复活开始了。一个罗马的百夫长惊讶地说出他的发现：“这（耶稣）真是个义人……这人真是神的儿子。”（路加福音23:47;马可福音15:39）。

#### Jesus Pierced and Buried （Matt. 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-55; John 19:31-42） 耶稣被刺并被安葬（马太福音27:57-61;马可福音15:42-47;路加福音23:50-55;约翰福音19:31-42）

Since evening was coming on and sundown marked the beginning of the Sabbath, the Jews asked that the execution be completed and the bodies removed from the crosses. By breaking the two criminals' legs the soldiers made sure that they would soon die. Jesus, however; was already dead. A soldier stuck a spear into his side, missing his ribs, but piercing his heart. This too was according to God's plan （Exod. 12:46; Ps. 34:20; Zech. 12:10）。

因为夜幕降临，太阳落山意味着安息日的开始，犹太人要求完成行刑并将尸体从十字架上移下。打折了耶稣身旁两个罪犯的腿骨之后，兵丁们知道他们会快会死去。然而，耶稣已经死了。一个兵丁用矛刺他的肋旁，没有刺到肋骨，而是直接刺入了心脏。这些同样都在上帝的计划中（出埃及记12:46;诗篇34:20;撒加利亚书12:10）。

The faithful women at the foot of the cross, as well as loyal John, were overcome with grief. They had made no plans for the Lord's burial. But God the Father had worked out the details in advance （Is. 53:9）。 The rich believer Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were allowed to bury the lifeless body. Good Friday came to a close. The Lord was buried in the Garden Tomb and a large stone was rolled into place, closing the burial chamber.

忠心跟随的妇女们围在十字架下，沉浸在悲伤中，其中也包括忠诚的约翰。他们完全不知该如何安葬他们的主。但是天父上帝已经预先做好了一切（以赛亚书53:9）。一个富有的亚利马太城信徒约瑟，和尼哥德慕一起被允许埋葬了耶稣的尸体。受难日即将结束了。主被安葬在一座院子中的墓穴里，墓穴用一块滚来的大石头封住了入口。
