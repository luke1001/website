#### Introduction 简介

In the last chapter we learned that in early October of A.D. 29 Jesus set out from Galilee for Jerusalem （Luke 9:51）， where he would suffer and die. He visited Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles and the Feast of Dedication, but it was not until the last of March that he finally rode through the city gates on Palm Sunday. In this chapter we will study Jesus' Perean Ministry （Perea is the area across the Jordan River from Judea）。 This part of Jesus' life has been called “the death journey.”

在上面一章的学习中我们已经知道，公元29年十月初，耶稣从加利利出发前往耶路撒冷（路加福音9:51），在那里他将要受苦，并且死去。他拜访耶路撒冷的时候，正值住棚节和修殿节期间，但是直到三月底的棕枝主日，耶稣才骑着驴驹穿过城门。在这章中，我们将会学习在庇哩亚人中的事工（与犹大隔河相望的区域就是庇哩亚）。这部分耶稣的生平被称作“死亡之旅”.

#### Jesus Teaching on the Way to Jerusalem （Luke 13:22-35） 耶稣在去往耶路撒冷的路上教导众人（路加福音13:22-35）

Jesus went into the towns and villages of Perea teaching about faith, salvation, and Judgment Day. Once someone asked, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” （Luke 13:23）。 We can imagine the thoughtful look which came across Christ's face. Rather than worry about the number of believers in heaven, the man should have made sure he was one of them. To show this Jesus spoke a parable about a house with only one door. Entry is gained only through repentance and faith and must take place before the door is shut.



耶稣穿行于庇哩亚地区的村庄城镇教导信心、救恩和最后的审判。一天某人问他说：“主啊，得救的人少吗？（路加福音13:23）”.我们可以想象，沉思的表情在耶稣的脸上一闪而过。与其担心天堂中信徒的数量，一个人应该先明确自己是不是其中的一员。为了表明这点，耶稣讲了一个比喻，关于一座只有一个门的房子。一定要赶在这扇门关闭之前，通过悔改和相信，才能得以进入此门。

At this time some Pharisees came to Jesus warning him to flee because Herod wanted to kill him. But Jesus would not be hurried. Jerusalem, not Herod's prison at Machaerus, would be where Jesus must die.

这时候，一些法利赛人来到耶稣面前，警告他希律王想要杀他，劝他赶快逃跑。但是耶稣没有惊慌。耶稣必将死在耶路撒冷，而不是希律在马卡鲁斯（Machaerus）的监狱里。

The name Jerusalem means “house of peace.” Nevertheless, it was the city where many prophets had suffered and some had even died: Zechariah （Luke 11:51）， Jeremiah, Uriah （Jer. 26:20-23） and possibly Isaiah （Heb. 11:37）。 “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem” Jesus said sadly （Luke 13:34）。 He would have saved the city if only the people had felt as did King David （Ps. 17:8）。

耶路撒冷的意思是“充满平安的房子”.不过，很多的先知曾在这个城市中受苦，他们中的一些甚至死在耶路撒冷：如撒迦利亚（路加福音11:51）、耶利米、乌利亚（耶利米书26:20-23），还有可能包括以赛亚（希伯来书11:37）。“耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊！”耶稣忧伤地低语。只要这些人有大卫王那样的感受（诗篇17:8），他都将拯救这座城市。

#### Dinner with a Well-known Pharisee （Luke 14:1-24） 与一个著名的法利赛人共进晚餐（路加福音14:1-24）

It seems that the Pharisees in Perea were like the Pharisees elsewhere. They too tried to catch Jesus breaking one of their Sabbath laws （see Chapter 4）。 Now at a big Sabbath dinner a man appeared, suffering from dropsy （swollen arms and legs）。 The man must have been a sad sight. Was it proper for Jesus to heal him? The Pharisees would not say, but Jesus did make him well. Instead of offering an excuse for his action, Jesus defended it. Jesus then gave the Pharisees a lesson in humility and unselfishness.


起来庇哩亚的法利赛人和其他地方的没有两样。他们也尝试着抓住耶稣不守安息日律法的把柄不放（参看第四章）。现在，一个人出现在一场盛大的安息日晚宴中，一个患有水臌并忍受着痛苦的人（四肢的肿胀）。这个人一定成了一道凄惨的风景。耶稣是否该医治他呢？法利赛人是不会说话的，但是耶稣却着实治愈了他。耶稣没有为自己的行为找什么托辞，而是选择为此辩护。随后他给法利赛人上了一课，关于谦卑和无私。

Jesus' words changed at least one heart. Someone exclaimed, “Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God” （Luke 14:15）。 Jesus then told the parable of The Great Banquet. The parable clearly teaches that Jesus offers his salvation to all people -- rich and poor, those respected in society and those forgotten by the world.

耶稣的话至少改变了一个人的心，“在神国里吃饭的有福了。（路加福音14:15）”耶稣随即讲了大筵席的比喻。这个比喻清晰地教导了，耶稣赐下了给万民的救恩——富有的和贫穷的，被社会所尊重的和已经被世界所遗忘的。

#### The Demands of Discipleship （Luke 14:25-35） 对门徒的要求（路加福音14:25-35）

There are certain people who follow Jesus when it is comfortable to do so. However, when being a Christian causes pain or interferes with their enjoyment of life, they abandon their Savior. Such people are often called fair-weather Christians.



当跟随耶稣是件很享受的事情时，确实有些人跟随着耶稣。然而，当因为基督徒的身份而导致痛苦或拦阻他们享受生活的时候，他们就放弃这位救主。这样的人被称为“只能同安乐，却不能共患难”的基督徒。

As the Lord traveled through Perea there were many people who wondered whether they should follow him. Jesus' words to them were clear and hard. Following Christ is no easy task and involves a serious commitment. It demands a total devotion to him that may lead to suffering and death for the sake of the Gospel.

当主穿过庇哩亚地区的时候，有很多的人心中思想着是否应该跟随耶稣。耶稣的话语对他们来说即清晰又困难。跟随耶稣不是件容易的事，这涉及到认真的委身。就是要求门徒全身心地跟随他，并可能因福音的缘故，导致苦难和死亡。

#### Parables of the Lost and Found （Luke 15:1-32） 失而复得的比喻（路加福音15:1-32）

By now it was perhaps early December of A.D. 29. Jesus and his disciples left Perea and started toward Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Dedication later that month. As the Lord went from place to place crowds gathered. Often tax collectors and other well-known “sinners” gathered to hear him, and Jesus tried to speak with them, sometimes during dinner. This upset the self-righteous Pharisees. But Jesus did not let them stop his ministry. He had come to help sinful men. To do that he had to meet with them.


此时可能是公元29年十二月初。耶稣和他的门徒们离开庇哩亚，开始向耶路撒冷行进，去庆祝这个月晚些时候的修殿节。当主从一个地方到另一个地方时，人们会闻声而至。经常那些税吏和其他众所周知的“罪人”们会聚集而来听耶稣的讲论，并且耶稣也尝试着与他们交谈，有时候是在聚餐的片刻。这一切使自以为义的法利赛人感到心烦。但是耶稣不会让他们打断自己的工作。他来是为帮助罪人。为此他必须与他们相见。

Christ showed why he was spending time with these outcasts of society by using three parables. In each parable something was lost then found or gladly received: a sheep, a coin worth a day's wages, and a son. These parables in Luke 15 have been called “the golden center” of this Gospel. It reveals in a wonderful way the love of the Savior for the lost and condemned sinners. The Parable of the Prodigal Son has been called “The greatest short story ever written!” It is like a bright star in the sky of Scripture.

通过三个比喻，基督表明了为什么他会与那些社会所不齿的人们在一起。在每一个比喻中，一些事物失而复得，或者被欢喜地接纳：一只羊，一个值一天薪水的硬币，和一个儿子。这些记载于路加福音15章中的比喻，被称作这卷福音书中的“黄金中心点”.通过美妙的方式，它显明了救主对所有失丧者和有罪之人的爱。浪子回头的比喻被称作“史上最伟大的短章！”它就像是浩瀚经文中的一颗明星。

#### Parables About Earthly Possessions （Luke 16:1-31） 世上财宝的比喻（路加福音16:1-31）

The three parables just mentioned were spoken to the Pharisees. Now Jesus turned to the disciples and spoke two more.

刚刚提到的三个比喻是说给法利赛人听的。现在耶稣转向门徒，又给他们讲了两个比喻。

People often think the parable of the Shrewd Manager （or Unjust Steward） is difficult to understand. But it is not. A dishonest worker was about to be fired by his master. But he was unwilling to let this crisis destroy his life so he cleverly （although dishonestly） used what he had to provide for his future. Jesus praised the man's smart thinking, not his dishonesty. In the same way Christ's disciples should use their earthly possessions cleverly and wisely to prepare for the coming life. This parable encouraged a godly use of earthly possessions. The parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus taught how possessions were not to be used.

人们常常觉得精明管家的比喻十分的难以理解。其实未必。一个不忠心的工人将被他的主人开除。但是他不太情愿让这个危机毁掉他的生活，所以他机敏地（然而也是不正直的）使用所有的一切为自己的未来谋划。耶稣夸奖的是这个人聪明的想法，而不是他的不忠。同样基督的门徒们应当聪明地使用他们地上的财富，并且智慧地为来生打算。这个比喻鼓励的是正确地使用世上的财富。财主和拉撒路的比喻则教导我们财产是如何变得一文不值的。

These two parables, intended for the disciples, were also heard by the Pharisees. They laughed at the first one, but the second one hit home

这两个讲给门徒的比喻，同样也被法利赛人听到。他们嘲笑第一个比喻，但是被第二个比喻直接击中要害。

#### Teaching on Related Subjects （Luke 17:1-10） 相关事情的教导（路加福音17:1-10）

During this part of his ministry, with the end so near, Jesus felt he had to teach the disciples as much as possible. Luke 17:1-10 is a good example. The Pharisees had become angry at what Jesus had said. Jesus had not caused them to stumble, but woe to those people who do cause others to stumble. Christians are not to offend other; rather they are to be willing to forgive those who sin against them. This requires a great amount of love which comes from a strong faith. Such faith naturally produces good works; yet such deeds must not be thought of as a way of earning salvation.

在这段传道工作期间，随着目的地近在咫尺，耶稣觉得他必须尽可能多地教导门徒们。路加福音17:1-10中的经文是一个很好的例子。法利赛人对耶稣所说的一切已经忍无可忍。耶稣并没有绊倒他们，但是那些确实绊倒别人的人有祸了。基督徒不是一些冒犯他人的人；反而他们是愿意饶恕那些冒犯了自己之人的一群人。做到这点需要极大的爱心，这些爱心来自于火热的信。这样的信心当然会生发出各样的善工；然而，一定不要以为这样的行为可以赚取得到救恩。

#### Jesus at the Feast of Dedication （John 10:22-42） 耶稣参加修殿节（约翰福音10:22-42）

Sometime near mid-December Jesus reached Jerusalem where he celebrated the Feast of Dedication （Hanukkah）。 The feast itself was a small festival in the Jewish calendar remembering the time in 165 B.C. when the temple was cleansed after having been made unclean by Gentiles. Since both the temple and homes were brightly lit with candles, the celebration was called the Festival of Lights. It was appropriate that the “true light” of the world （John 1:9） should once again shine forth in the temple, but as John （1:5） said, “The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.”

将近十二月中旬的时候，耶稣到达了耶路撒冷，并参与庆祝修殿节（也称光明节）。在犹太历法里这只是一个很小的节日，为的是纪念公元前165年，被外邦人玷污的圣殿得以洁净。届时圣殿和家里都会点上明亮的蜡烛，因此庆典也被称为光明节。这样做是为了感激世上“真光”（约翰福音1:9）将再次在圣殿中光芒四射，但就像约翰（约翰福音1:5）说的一样：“光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。”

It was a cold winter day as Jesus walked along the temple porch, but the real chill was in the hearts of many. Jews crowded around Jesus. They were still demanding proof that he was the Messiah. He had given such proof before, but they had refused to believe it.

当耶稣行走在圣殿的廊下是，正值寒冬，但是真正的寒冷却是在很多人的心中。犹太人拥挤着耶稣。他们还是要得到耶稣是弥赛亚的证据。此前耶稣已经很多次证明了这点，但是犹太人门却拒绝相信。

The words Jesus spoke to these hardened unbelievers are still comforting to Christians today. God the Father and God the Son, equal in power, knowledge, and love, work as a team to preserve the believers.

耶稣讲给数以百计不信者的话语，今天仍旧安慰着基督徒们。天父上帝和上帝的儿子，有同样的能力，知识和爱，他们在一起协作保守每一个信徒。

The Jews tried to extinguish the Light with stones, so the Lord and his disciples went back to Perea. There they remained for a time.

犹太人试图用石头“熄灭真光”,所以主和他的门徒们启程返回了庇哩亚，并在那里停留了一段时间。

#### The Call to Bethany and the Raising of Lazarus （John 11:1-46） 伯大尼的呼召和拉撒路的复活（约翰福音11:1-46）

It may have been in February of A.D. 30 when word reached Jesus that his friend Lazarus was ill and about to die. But Jesus waited to leave for Bethany until Lazarus was dead. The glory of God's Son would again be shown.

当消息传到耶稣那里时，时间可能是在公元30年的2月间，耶稣的朋友拉撒路生病并且将要死去。但是直到拉撒路已经死了，耶稣才不再逗留，并出发前往伯大尼。上帝儿子的荣耀将再次被显明。

John 11:17-44 tells us what happened next. Jesus had a warm, personal love for the sisters, Mary and Martha, and their brother Lazarus. This love produced tears of pity and sorrow. However, Jesus showed a deeper kind of love, love in the truest spiritual sense. This was the love which was pulling Jesus ever closer to Calvary's cross. This was the love which made him say “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die” （John 11:25-26）。 The resurrection of Lazarus proved his statement.

约翰福音11:17-44节的经文告诉我们接下来发生了什么。耶稣对这对姐妹马利亚和马大，以及她们的兄弟拉撒路，有着一份体贴的、个人性的关爱。这份爱使耶稣流下了怜悯和哀伤的泪水。然而这次，耶稣显出他更深的爱，追真切的属灵之爱。正是这份爱驱使着耶稣一步一步走向髑髅地的十字架。正是这份爱使他说出：“复活在我，生命也在我。信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活。凡活着信我的人必永远不死。（约翰福音11:25-26）”.拉撒路的复活证实了他所说的一切。

#### Plot Against Jesus and his Retreat to Ephraim （John 11:45-54）  密谋杀害耶稣，及他退到以法莲（约翰福音11:45-54）

Jesus raised Lazarus. By doing this he showed “his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” （John 1:14）。 Some of the Jews saw and believed, others hardened their hearts. The Jewish religious leaders plotted while the high priest declared “it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation die” （John 11:50）。 What Caiaphas said by his human reason and hatred was exactly what God was doing in his love.


耶稣使拉撒路复活了。通过这个神迹他显示了“自己的荣耀，从父而来的独生子的荣耀，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。”（约翰福音1:14）。一些犹太人看到并信了，其他的那些人心则硬着心肠。犹太的宗教领袖商议要杀耶稣，因为大祭司宣称“一个人替百姓死，免得通国灭亡。（约翰福音11:50）”.该亚法处于人的原因和憎恨所说的话，却正显明了上帝因他的爱正做的一切。

The final plot to kill Jesus was begun. Since it was not the right time for his death, Jesus and his disciples went away to Ephraim, a village 20 miles north of Jerusalem.

最终杀害耶稣的密谋开始了。因为耶稣死的时候还没有到，他和门徒们就退到了以法莲，一个在耶路撒冷以北20英里的村子里。

#### The Ten Lepers Healed （Luke 17:11-19） 医治十个大麻风病人（路加福音17:11-19）

0ne day as Jesus walked along the border between Samaria and Galilee he heard the cry of ten poor men. They cried out “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” （Luke 17:13）。 They had leprosy for which there was no cure （see Chapter 3）。 Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests as the Old Testament commanded （see Lev. 13-14）。 As they went they were cured.



一天当耶稣正行走到撒马利亚和加利利边界地区时，他听到十个可怜人的哀嚎。他们喊着说：“耶稣，夫子，可怜我们吧！”（路加福音17:13）。他们得了不能治愈的大麻风（参看第三章）。耶稣告诉他们遵照旧约的命令去见祭司，并将他们的身体给祭司查看（参看利未记13-14章）。当他们去的时候，他们就洁净了。

There are several lessons to be learned from this story. First, this ten-in-one miracle shows Jesus' power. He did not speak to the disease or touch the lepers, but healed them from a distance. From this we can conclude that Jesus even from heaven can help us in with our earthly problems. Second, the lepers showed great faith, for they obeyed Jesus without questioning. We should also remember that faith is accepting Christ and his Word without any doubts. Finally, there is the sad truth that few are “found to return and give praise to God” （Luke 17:18）。 This sad fact should help us understand our own lack of thanks and should encourage us to often say “thank you” to God for all his blessings.

从这个故事我们可以学到很多。首先，这个“十合一”的神迹显示了耶稣的能力。他没有谈论这个疾病，也没有碰大麻风病人；而是凭空地医治了他们。由此我们可以知道，即使耶稣是从天上而来，他仍能帮助我们解决地上的需求。其次，大麻风病人显示出极大的信心，因为他们遵照耶稣的命令，毫无质疑。我们也应该记住，信心就是没有任何疑虑地接受基督和他的话语。最后，一个悲哀的真相是很少的人“回来归荣耀与神”（路加福音17:18）。这个让人伤感的事实可以帮助我们明白我们如此缺乏感恩，并且可以鼓励我们因为上帝的祝福，常常地对他说声“感谢”.

#### The Coming of the Kingdom （Luke 17:20-37） 神国的来临（路加福音17:20-37）

Jesus claimed to be the Messiah, the promised Savior. Jesus Pharisees incorrectly felt that the Messiah would begin a political kingdom here on earth. They were looking for signs of his earthly rule. Jesus disappointed them. He said that the Kingdom of God is spiritual, not visible, and that it is already here.

耶稣宣告说他是弥赛亚，应许的救世主。法利赛人错误地认为耶稣这位弥赛亚，将要开始一个地上的政权。他们一直在寻找耶稣属世统治的蛛丝马迹。但耶稣让他们失望了。他说上帝的国度是属灵的国，是看不见的，并且这国度已经降临了。

Nevertheless, if they wanted signs, he would give some. Just before Judgment Day deception and faithlessness will be found everywhere; many or most people will be caught up in the pleasures of the time. Then, suddenly, the Lord will return.

不过，如果法利赛人想要一些信号，耶稣将会给他们一些。在最后的审判来临之前，地上将充满了欺骗和不忠；很多或者绝大部分的人将会陷入其时的愉悦中。然后，主会突然地再来。

#### Parables on Prayer （Luke 18:1-14） 祷告的比喻（路加福音18:1-14）

Christ's teaching about Judgment Day must have frightened the disciples. So “Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up” （Luke 18:1）。 In the parable about the widow, Jesus used the example of an ungodly judge who made decisions only for his own good. If such a man would be finally give in to continuous asking, how much more will a loving God be moved by the repeated prayers of his people.

基督关于最后审判日的教导，一定吓到了他的门徒们。因此“耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心”（路加福音18:1）。在关于寡妇的祷告里，耶稣讲到一个不惧怕神，并且只为自己的好处着想的官员的例子。如果这样一个人最终都会因为连续的请求而让步，那么当上帝的子民不断地向他请求时，这位充满爱的天父将会有多么大的触动啊！

According to Luke's Gospel, Jesus next spoke the parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector. Martin Luther, in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians says there are two types of righteousness: active righteousness and passive righteousness. Active righteousness is man's useless attempt to earn his own salvation by obeying the Law and doing good works （like the Pharisee in the parable）。 Passive righteousness is receiving what Jesus freely gives – forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. Such God-pleasing righteousness is shown in the tax collector's prayer. The parable ends like this, “everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” （Luke 18:14）。

根据路加福音的记载，耶稣接着讲了法利赛人和税吏的比喻。马丁路德在他加拉太书的释经中提到了两种义：主动的义和被动的义。主动的义是指人们无谓的尝试，企图通过遵守律法和善工来赚取救恩（像比喻中的法利赛人一样）。被动的义是指领受耶稣白白赐予的——罪的赦免、生命和救赎。这种上帝喜悦的义表现在这个税吏的祷告中。这个比喻是这样结束的：“凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。（路加福音18:14）”

#### Jesus Teaching on Marriage, Divorce, and Children （Matt. 19:1-15; Mark 10:1-26; Luke 18:15-17） 耶稣关于婚姻，离婚和孩子的教导（马太福音19:1-15;马可福音10:1-26;路加福音18:15-17）


By now it was March of A.D. 30. For six months Jesus had wandered throughout Perea, Judea, and into Samaria. However, during this time he was coming always closer to his death. Now he visited Perea for the last time, and from there went on towards Jerusalem.

时间已经来到公元30年的三月。六个月来，耶稣都游走在庇哩亚、犹大和撒马利亚地区。无论如何，在这段时间里耶稣都离他的死亡越来越近。现在他最后一次拜访庇哩亚，并会从那里前往耶路撒冷。

Jesus' first miracle was at the wedding in Cana. Now near the end of his ministry the subject of marriage was raised. In Deuteronomy 24:1 Moses spoke about divorce. During Jesus' time followers of the famous Jewish teacher Hillel thought this verse meant a man could divorce his wife for almost any reason, including burning his dinner. The followers of the teacher Shammai, on the other hand, said that people could divorce only when there was a moral sin by one, but that might be as simple as a woman appearing on the street without a veil covering her face. The Pharisees now asked Jesus about divorce hoping that he would take sides in the argument. Jesus refused to do this. Instead, he spoke about what a marriage is and that it is God's plan that husband and wife remain married for life.

耶稣所行的第一个神迹是在迦拿的婚宴上。现在，临近他传道工作的尽头时，有关婚姻的话题再次被提及。在申命记24:1节中，摩西谈到关于离婚的事情。在耶稣的时代，著名的犹太教师希勒尔（Hillel）的学生们认为这节经文的意思是，一个男人可以以任何理由与他的妻子离婚，包括烧焦了饭。另外，教师撒买（Shammai）的学生们则说，只有在其中一方违背道德律法而犯罪的时候，人们可以离婚；但是罪行可能只是一个女人没有以面纱遮面，而出现在街上这样的行为。法利赛人如今问耶稣离婚的事情，希望耶稣将会站在某一种立场上。但是耶稣拒绝这样做。取而代之的是，他谈到婚姻是什么，以及丈夫和妻子一生持守婚姻是上帝的计划。

Was Moses wrong in granting divorce? Jesus pointed out that Moses did not command or favor divorce, but only permitted it, and only then as a way of avoiding further sin. The Old Testament says Christians are allowed to divorce only in cases of adultery. Later in the New Testament Paul says that abandonment is also a proper reason for divorce （1 Cor. 7:15）。

摩西准许离婚的行为错了吗？耶稣指出，摩西并非赞同离婚；他只是允许离婚，并且只是作为避免继续犯罪的一种办法。旧约中提到基督徒只有在犯了奸淫的时候才允许离婚。随后在新约中保罗提到，被不信的配偶遗弃也是一个合适的离婚理由（哥林多前书7:15）。

Should men remain single? No. Man is suited for a married life. But some men may remain unmarried if they are able to live that way without being tempted to sin.

男人应该持守单身吗？不是的。婚姻的生活对男人是合宜的。但是当某些人能够持守单身而不受罪的试探时，他们当然可以那么做。

One of the reasons for marriage was to raise children. Jesus held little children in his arms and blessed them. He made it clear that the Kingdom of God is for them, too. In other words, because little children are sinners, Christ also wants them to come to faith and receive his forgiveness.

婚姻存在的原因之一是生儿育女。耶稣怀抱着孩子们并为他们祝福。他十分清楚地表明，上帝的国度也是为他们预备的。换句话说，小孩子们也是罪人，基督同样希望他们相信并接受他的赦免。 　　　

#### The Rich Young Ruler and Laborers in the Vineyard （Matt. 19:16-20:16; Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30） 富有的青年官和葡萄园的工人（马太福音19:16-20:16;马可福音10:17-31;路加福音18:18-30）

As Jesus continued on his journey a rich young ruler came and asked: “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?” （Matt. 19:16）。 The man was trying to earn his own salvation （the active righteousness mentioned above）。 If a person would save himself he must obey the Law perfectly. While the young man felt he had done just that, Jesus opened his eyes. The man loved his money more than God, a breaking of the first commandment.

耶稣继续着他的旅程，一个富有的青年官来问他：“夫子，我该做什么善事才能得永生？（马太福音19:16）”这个青年人尝试着赚取他自己的救恩（前面提到的主动的义）。如果一个人让自己得救，他必须完美地遵守律法。当这个年轻人觉得他已经做到了的时候，耶稣让他明白。相比上帝，这个人更加爱慕钱财，这违背了第一条诫命的要求。

If a person cannot save himself, how can he be saved? Jesus' answer was clear, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” （Matt. 19:26）。 Man is saved by the gracious will of God which man only accepts （Luther's passive righteousness）。

如果一个人不能救他自己，他如何能得救呢？耶稣的回答非常清楚：“在人这是不能的，在神凡事都能。（马太福音19:26）”人得救是靠着上帝美好的旨意，他只要接受即可（路德所称的“被动的义”）。

Jesus wanted to emphasize that man is saved by grace and not by good works. Therefore he told a parable about a man who went out and found people without work and gave them a job. At the end of the day even those who had worked a short time each received a full wage. When one remembers that salvation is an unearned gift, the person who is a Christian his whole life will be happy that a recent convert has an equal place in the Kingdom of God.

耶稣想要强调的是，人得救是靠恩典，而不是靠好的行为。因此他讲了一个比喻，关于一个人出去找到一些没有工作的人，并给了他们差事。在一天结束的时候，那些即使只是工作了几个小时的人，也都得到了全天的工价。当思想到救恩是白白的礼物时，为了那些刚刚回转相信的人在上帝的国度中有着相同的位置，毕生都是基督徒的人们将要欢呼喜乐了。

#### Jesus Predicts his Death A Third Time （Matt. 20:17-19; Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34） 耶稣第三次预言他的死（马太福音20:17-19;马可福音10:32-34;路加福音18:31-34）

While on the road to Jerusalem, Jesus once again told the disciples of his death. For the first time he spoke to them about how he would die – by being crucified.

在去往耶路撒冷的路上，耶稣再一次向他的门徒们诉说他的死亡。这是第一次他告诉门徒们他将如何死去——被钉在十字架上。

#### A Mother's Ambitious Request （Matt 20:20-28; Mark 10:35-45） 一个妈妈过分的请求（马太福音20:20-28;马可福音10:35-45）

The Pharisees were not the only ones with a false idea about the Kingdom of God. One of Christ's followers, the mother of his disciples James and John, came to Jesus with a request. She wanted her sons to receive the greatest power and glory in Jesus' earthly kingdom. Angry and jealous, the other disciples began to object. To the surprise of all, Jesus taught that humility was the route to glory in his spiritual kingdom.

法利赛人并不是唯一对上帝的国度有错误理解的人。一个基督的跟随者，雅各和约翰的妈妈带着一个请求来到耶稣面前。她希望她的儿子们在耶稣地上的国度中，得到最大的能力和荣耀。其他的门徒们即恼怒又嫉妒，并开始反驳。让所有人意外的是耶稣教导说，谦卑才是通往他属灵国度荣耀的路径。

#### On To Jericho （Matt. 20:29-34; Mark 20:46-52; Luke 18:35-19:28） 上到耶利哥城（马太福音20:29-34;马可福音20:46-52;路加福音18:35-19:28）

The trip to Jerusalem was nearing its end. As Jesus approached Jericho a crowd gathered, but two voices could be heard above all others. Bartimaeus and another blind man cried out for mercy. While they were in physical darkness, their souls were lighted. They knew Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Son of David. Once again Jesus showed he was God's son and healed them. In return they followed him, praising God.

前往耶路撒冷的旅程接近尾声。当耶稣接近耶利哥城的时候，一群人聚集到了那里，但是在众多嘈杂的声音中，有两个人的声音尤其清晰。巴底买和另一个瞎眼的人为得怜悯而大声呼求。虽然他们活在黑暗中，但他们的灵魂是明亮的。他们知道耶稣是那应许的弥赛亚，大卫的子孙。又一次耶稣显示他是上帝的儿子，他医治了他们。作为回应，两个人跟随了耶稣，并赞美上帝。

By now it was Friday, March 30, one week before Good Friday. Jesus was in Jericho, 15 miles from Jerusalem. As he walked through the crowded streets he came to a certain spot, stopped, and looked up. There in a tree was a short man named Zacchaeus. Jesus spoke and dined with this chief tax collector and great sinner. More importantly, Jesus led Zacchaeus to know his sins and to faith. After all, this was in agreement with Jesus' mission “to seek and to save what was lost” （Luke 19:10）。

此时是3月30日，星期五，距离受难日还有一周的时间。耶稣在耶利哥城，距离耶路撒冷15英里。他径直穿过拥挤的街道，来到一处，停下来并仰起头。一个名叫撒该且身材矮小的人正待在一棵树上。耶稣向这个人说话，并与这个税吏长，一个十恶不赦的人共进了晚餐。更重要的是，耶稣使撒该知道他的罪并给他信心。毕竟，这正是耶稣的使命——“寻找并拯救失丧的人（路加福音19:10）”.

By this time Jesus' disciples must have been very excited. They no doubt felt that Jesus would soon set his political kingdom on earth. In a parable he tried to correct their thinking. He, the nobleman, would leave for a time. Meanwhile his followers would be given a treasure to use – God's Word. One day, Judgment Day, he would return, punish his enemies, and give rewards of grace to the faithful.

到目前为止，耶稣的门徒门一定异常兴奋。他们认为耶稣将要建立他地上的政权是毋庸置疑的。耶稣试着通过一个比喻来纠正他们的想法。他，这个高贵的人将要离开一阵子。那时他的跟随者们将赠与一份宝物，并使用它——上帝的话语。有一天，审判日的那天，耶稣将会再来，惩罚他的敌人们，并且以恩惠奖赏那些忠实的人们。
