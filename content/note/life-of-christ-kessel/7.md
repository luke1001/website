#### Introduction 简介

Jesus' public ministry in Galilee was now finished. John the Baptist was dead and the disciples had returned from their preaching tour. Jesus had also tried to withdraw from public attention. He wanted to be alone with his disciples and finish teaching them the truths of Christianity. He also needed time to prepare himself for his own suffering and death. In the last chapter we ended with Jesus' first withdrawal. It was in the late spring of A.D. 29 when the crowds pursued him from Bethsaida Julias to Capernaum. Now, between early summer and mid-October he withdrew three more times.

耶稣在加利利的公开宣教到此结束了。施洗约翰被杀，耶稣的门徒们已经结束各自宣教的行程并返回。耶稣也试图远离公众的关注。他希望与自己的门徒们独处，并完成对他们基督徒真理的教导。他也需要时间为将受的苦难并受死准备好自己。在上一章中，我们以耶稣第一次的“撤退”结束。彼时是公元29年的晚春，人群从伯赛大追随他直到迦百农。现在，在初夏和十月中旬之间耶稣又有了三次的“撤退”.

#### Jesus' Second Withdrawal 耶稣第二次“撤退”


After his meeting with the Jews who thought they could earn salvation by obeying the Old Testament laws, Jesus tried to withdraw for a second time. But once again he was not able to be alone.

当与那些认为自己可以通过遵守旧约律法来赚得救恩的犹太人们会面之后，耶稣试图第二次离开人群。但是又一次，他没能一个人独处。

#### Healing of the Canaanite Woman's Daughter （Matt. 15:21-28; Mark 7:24-30; John 7:1） 医治迦南妇人的女儿（马太福音15:21-28;马可福音7:24-30;约翰福音7:1）

Jesus would have been arrested if he had gone to Judea at this time. So instead he went north and east to the area around the Gentile cities of Tyre and Sidon. Even there his presence soon became known.


倘若耶稣此时前往犹大地的话，他一定已经被捕了。所以耶稣转向东北地区，来到了外邦人的城市推罗和西顿附近。即使是在那里，他的出现很快就众所周知了。

There a Gentile woman came to Jesus and begged him to heal her demon-possessed daughter. But Jesus pretended not to be interested or care about her problem. At last, however, the reason for his unusual behavior became clear. He had let the woman exercise her faith, thus making it stronger. Then Jesus gladly healed her daughter.

那里有一个外邦的妇人来见耶稣，并且祈求他医治自己被鬼附的女儿。但是耶稣佯装对此没有兴趣，对她的问题漠不关心。然而最后，耶稣这不寻常举动的原因变得明朗。他是在操练这位妇女的信心，使其更加强壮。随后耶稣欣然地医治了她的女儿。

In the Gospels there are several stories in which Jesus attracted Gentile followers: the Wise Men who followed his star （Matt. 2:1-12）， the Samaritan woman at the well （John 4:4-26）， the centurion at Capernaum （Matt 8:5-13）， and now the Canaanite woman. Nevertheless, during his earthly stay Jesus spent most of his energy working among the Jews. After going back to heaven, Jesus would attract to himself the Gentiles as well （Luke 2:32）。

在福音书中有很多的故事，在这些故事里耶稣吸引来外邦的跟随者们：如跟随“他的星”的博士们（马太福音2:1-12）；井边的撒马利亚妇人（约翰福音4:4-26）；迦百农的百夫长（马太福音8:5-13）；以及现在迦南的妇人。虽然如此，当耶稣在世上的时候，他大部分的经历都倾注在犹太人身上。当回到天上之后，耶稣同样将外邦人引向他自己（路加福音2:32）。

In general, then, the Gospels show the effect of Jesus' Word among the Jews, while the rest of the New Testament shows the power of that Word among the Gentiles. Meanwhile, the New Testament as a whole presents Jesus as the only Savior for all mankind.

总之，福音书显示了耶稣话语在犹太人中造成的影响，而在新约的其他部分则显示出这些话语在外邦人中的能量。同时，新约总的来说表明耶稣是全人类唯一的救主。

#### Jesus' Third Withdrawal 耶稣第三次“撤退”

Apparently Jesus stayed for only a short time in the region of Tyre and Sidon. We are not told why he left so soon. Perhaps it was because crowds of curious people were again bothering him. Therefore Jesus withdrew for yet a third time.

显然耶稣只是在推罗和西顿少许的停留。我们不知道他为什么那么快地离开。也许是因为好奇的人群再次地打扰了他。因此耶稣第三次地远离人群。

#### Healing in Decapolis （Matt. 15:29-31; Mark 7:31-37） 在低加波利的医治（马太福音15:29-31;马可福音7:31-37）

The exact route of Jesus' third withdrawal is not given in the Scriptures. The master and his disciples probably crossed northern Galilee, then went south to the Sea of Galilee. From there they would have gone on to the partly pagan area of Decapolis （east of the Sea of Galilee）。 During the days of walking and the nights of camping out under the summer skies Jesus taught the disciples many things.


经文中没有告诉我们耶稣第三次”撤退“的准确路线。这位夫子和他的门徒们很可能穿过了北加利利地区，然后向南到达加利利海。从那里他们应该经过了低加波利的部分区域（加利利海东侧）。他们白天行走，夜晚露宿在夏日的星空下，耶稣将许多的事情教导给他的门徒们。

The name of Jesus was big news in Decapolis. Therefore, a large crowd soon gathered, including many sick people, and one deaf and dumb man. Jesus took that man aside, touched his ear with his finger and touched his tongue with saliva from his mouth. At the command ”be opened“ the man's ears and mouth were restored to their normal use.

耶稣的名字对于低加波利的人来说是个轰动的事情。所以，人们很快地聚集起来，其中包括很多病患，以及一个又聋又哑的人。耶稣将这个人叫到一边，用手指摸她的眼睛，用唾沫抹他的舌头。然后命令说”开了吧“,这个人的耳朵和嘴就痊愈，恢复正常了。 　　　

#### Feeding of the Four Thousand （Matt. 15:32-38; Mark 8:1-9） 喂饱4000人（马太福音15:32-38;马可福音8:1-9）

When the crowd saw that Jesus had healed the man, they began to praise the God of Israel （Matt. 15:31）。 For the next three days they followed Jesus in the desert. The Lord knew that the heat of the summer sun and the lack of food would soon weaken the people. So he told the people to sit down, gave thanks, and with a few small fish and seven loaves of bread fed 4000 men, plus many other women and children. There were seven baskets of leftovers collected after the meal.


当人们看到耶稣医治了那又聋又哑的人之后，他们开始赞美以色列的上帝（马太福音15:31）。接下来的三天里，他们在沙漠中都跟随着耶稣。主知道夏日的炎热和食物的短缺很快会让人们筋疲力尽。所以他让人们坐下，祝谢了，用几条小鱼和七个饼喂饱了4000男人，外加很多的妇女和儿童。饭后收拾剩下的零碎，装满了七个筐子。

#### Return to Galilee （Matt. 15:39-16:4; Mark 8:9-12） 回到加利利（马太福音15:39-16:4;马可福音8:9-12）

Jesus sent the people away after they had eaten. Then, along with the disciples, he got on a boat and set sail for the opposite shore – the area of Magdala.


人们吃饱了后，耶稣打发他们离开。然后他与门徒们一起，找了一条船，动身前往隔海相望的抹大拉地区。

Somehow the Galileans found out that Jesus was returning. As the boat came to shore, there were Pharisees and Sadducees waiting to meet him.

加利利人不知如何知道了耶稣正回来的事。当船到达岸边的时候，法利赛人和撒都该人也在那里等着见耶稣。

Normally the Pharisees and Sadducees were enemies. But both groups hated Jesus so much that they now were working together. The Pharisees held to every word of the Old Testament and tried to earn salvation by obeying its laws. The Sadducees used the Old Testament as just a general guide and didn't even believe in life after death. Both groups, however, agreed that Jesus was not God's Son or the Messiah. The two groups of Jewish leaders now commanded Jesus to do a miracle to prove that he was the Messiah. Apparently the feeding of the 5000 was not enough proof for them.

一般来说，法利赛人和撒都该人是宿敌。但是他们都非常的痛恨耶稣，以至于他们现在同仇敌忾。法利赛人持守旧约的每一句话，并且试图通过遵循律法来赚的救恩。撒都该人仅仅把旧约当作一个普通的教导，并且从不相信死后的生命。然而，他们两群人都认同一点，耶稣不是上帝的儿子或者弥赛亚。这两群犹太人的领袖们现在要求耶稣行一个神迹，以证明他是弥赛亚。显然喂饱5000人的神迹作为证据，对他们来说还是不够。

Jesus was astonished at their unbelief. They could read the signs of the weather （red sky in the morning, sailor take warning; red sky at night, sailor's delight）。 But they could not read the signs that Jesus was God （his many miracles in Galilee and his teachings）。

耶稣对他们的不信感到震惊。他们通晓天气变化的征兆（早晨天发红，水手们要小心了；晚上天发红，水手们安枕无忧）。但是他们却读不出耶稣是上帝的征兆（他在加利利所行很多的神迹和他的教导）。 　　　 Jesus did not immediately follow their demands. Instead, he promised a final sign to show that he was God – the sign of Jonah. Just like Jonah came back after three days in the whale, Jesus would also rise from the dead.

耶稣没有立即满足他们的要求。反而，他应许了那最后的征兆，以显示他是上帝——约拿的神迹。像鲸鱼腹中的约拿三天之后返回一样，耶稣也将如此死里复活。

#### Jesus' Fourth Withdrawal 耶稣第四次“撤退”

Jesus' stay in Galilee was short. After his run in with the Jewish leaders he left Galilee and the cities where he had preached and worked miracles. He headed for Bethsaida Julias, but first he stopped on a mountain in the northern part of Galilee.


耶稣在加利利待了较短的时间。当他与犹太的领袖们狭路相逢之后，耶稣离开了加利利以及那些他讲道和行神迹的城市。他出发前往伯赛大，在此之前，耶稣在加利利海北边的一座山上短暂地停留。

#### Warning Against Pharisees and Sadducees （Matt. 16:4-12; Mark 8:14-21） 警惕法利赛人和撒都该人（马太福音16:5-12;马可福音8:14-21）

Jesus and the disciples got on a boat and sailed north. Although his heart was full of sorrow, he still continued to teach his disciples. He warned them not to become legalistic like the Pharisees or to deny Scripture like the Sadducees. He compared their errors to yeast in bread. And it was a powerful comparison. Just as a little yeast spreads through all the bread dough, any doctrinal error can spread through the whole teaching of salvation. Unfortunately, at this time the disciples missed the point of Jesus' instruction.


耶稣和门徒们上了船向北行驶，尽管他的心中充满了忧伤，他仍旧不断地教导他的学生们。他警告他们不要变成像法利赛人一样的律法主义者，也不要变成像撒都该人一样否认圣经的人。耶稣将他们的错误比喻成面包中的酵母。这是一个强有力的对比。就像是一小点酵让整团面发起来，任何教义的错误可能扩展到所有关于救恩的教导上。不幸的是，此时此刻门徒们并没有抓住耶稣教导的重点。

#### Blind Man at Bethsaida （Mark 8:22-26） 伯赛大的瞎子（马可福音8:22-26）

The boat sailed north until the Lord and his followers got off near Bethsaida Julias. Soon a blind man was led to Jesus. Christ, not wanting to gather a crowd, led the man to a place where they could be more alone. Then Jesus restored the man's sight.


小船一路向北，直到主和他的门徒们在伯赛大附近上岸。很快有人带着一个瞎眼的人来见耶稣。因为不想使人群聚集起来，基督将这人带到一个他们可以独处的地方。然后耶稣使他重现光明。

This time Jesus did not cure the man all at once, but little by little. However, when the man could see clearly Jesus commanded him to keep silent about the miracle. He did not want another crowd to gather.

这次耶稣并没有一次性地医治，而是一步一步地治愈他， 然而，当这个人可以看清楚时，耶稣命令他对这个神迹保持缄默。因为他不想再次招来大批的人群。

#### Peter's Second Great Confession （Matt. 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21） 彼得第二次伟大的宣告（马太福音16:13-20;马可福音8:27-30;路加福音9:18-21）

Jesus' search for privacy and rest took him from Bethsaida Julias to the very northern part of Israel, to the city of Caesarea Philippi. This 30 mile walk was uphill all the way. Jesus carried with him a concern for the spiritual welfare of all mankind – of the disciples in particular. Thus, Jesus asked the disciples, ”Who do people say I am?“ （Mark 8:27）。 Their answer was disappointing. The Jews considered Jesus to be a prophet sent from God, but not God's Son, the Savior. Jesus faced the disciples and ask, ”Who do you say I am?“（Mark 8:29）。 It was Peter who gave the correct answer. He confessed, ”You are the Christ, the Son of the living God“ （Matt. 16:16）。


耶稣希望找到安静和隐秘的地方，这个想法将他从伯赛大带到了以色列的最北边，凯撒利亚腓立比城。这30英里的路全部都是上坡。耶稣心中挂念着全人类属灵的福祉——尤其是他门徒们的。因此，他问他们：”人说我是谁？“ （马可福音8:27）。门徒们回答是令人失望的。犹太人以为耶稣是上帝派来的先知，但不是上帝的儿子，他们的救主。耶稣直面门徒们并问他们说：”你们说我是谁？“（马可福音8:29）。彼得给出了正确的答案。他宣告说：”你是基督，是永生神的儿子。“（马太福音16:16）。

While Jesus was happy with Peter's answer, he quickly added that it was God who had created this faith within Peter. Anyone who makes such a Peter-like confession will gain entry into the Kingdom of God. Upon this truth the church is built. Furthermore, Jesus commanded the believers （the Church） to use God's Law to tell unrepentant sinners that they will not enter heaven, and to use the Gospel of Jesus Christ （including the Sacraments） to unlock the gates of the kingdom for those who do repent.

当然耶稣为彼得的回答而高兴，他立即补充说，是上帝已经生发了彼得里面的信心。任何人像彼得一样宣告，都将会获准进入上帝的国度。教会就建立在这样的基础上。此外，耶稣命令信徒们（教会）使用上帝的律法，告诉那些不悔改的罪人，他们将不能进入天堂；同样使用耶稣基督的福音（包括圣礼），为那些悔改的人打开天国的大门。

#### Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection （Matt. 16:21-28; Mark 8:31-9:1; Luke 9:22-27） 耶稣预言他的死和复活（马太福音16:21-28;马可福音8:31-9:1;路加福音9:22-27）

Jesus knew from Peter's confession that the disciples understood he was God's Son. Yet they still did not understand his plan for saving the world. In order to explain this plan Jesus now began to give them details about his coming death and resurrection. He said that soon they would go to Jerusalem where he would be executed by the Jewish religious leaders. But on the third day he would come to life again.

耶稣从彼得的宣告中知道，门徒们明白他是上帝的儿子。但是他们仍旧不懂耶稣拯救世界的计划。为了解释他的计划，耶稣现在开始将他即将面对的死亡和复活的细节，一一告诉他们。耶稣说没多久，他们要去耶路撒冷，在那里他将被犹太宗教领袖处以死刑。但是在第三天他将要复活。

At least once before Jesus had told about his death （John 3:14）。 This time, however, Peter objected. Pulling Jesus aside, Peter told Jesus he was wrong to speak about dying. Jesus answered, ”Out of my sight, Satan!“ （Mark 8:33）。 These were the same words Jesus had directed toward the devil in the wilderness two and a half years earlier, and for good reason. Both the devil and Peter tried to keep Jesus from fulfilling his saving mission.

在此之前耶稣至少有一次谈过了他的死亡（约翰福音3:14）。然而这一次，彼得表示拒绝。彼得将耶稣叫到一边，对耶稣说谈论他的死亡是不对的。耶稣回答说：”撒旦，退我后边去吧！“（马可福音8:33）。两年半前当耶稣在旷野中，耶稣直接面对魔鬼时说了同样的话。这样说有一个好的理由——魔鬼和彼得都试图拦阻耶稣完成他救赎的使命。 　　　 

Jesus then went on to give a sermon to his disciples. He told them why Peter's human point of view was wrong. ”What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for His soul?“ （Mark 8:36-37）。

接下来，耶稣继续训诫他的门徒们。他告诉他们为什么彼得这种人的想法是错的。”人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？人还能拿什么换生命呢？“（马可福音8:36-37）。

#### The Transfiguration （Matt. 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36） 登山变像（马太福音17:1-13;马可福音9:2-13;路加福音9:28-36）

Six days later Jesus' closest disciples （Peter, James, and John） had an unforgettable experience. John later wrote concerning it ”We have seen his [Jesus'] glory. . . （John 1:14）。 Peter wrote, “We were eyewitnesses of his majesty. . .” （2 Pet. 1:16）。

六天后，耶稣最亲近的门徒们（彼得，雅各和约翰）领受了一次难以忘怀的经历。约翰后来写到这经历的时候说：“我们也见过他（耶稣的）的荣光”（约翰福音1:14）。彼得则这样写道：“我们……亲眼见过他的威荣”（彼得后书1:16）。

As frequently was His custom, Jesus went up on a mountain to pray in the evening. This time he and his three disciples went up the side of a mountain, probably Mt. Hermon. As he climbed Jesus thought about his own sufferings and death were on his mind.

按耶稣惯常的习惯，他在早晨的时候上山祷告。这次他和他的三个门徒登到上，这山有可能是黑门山。一路上耶稣脑海里思想着他的苦难和死亡。

During the night while the disciples slept, Jesus' divine nature which was usually invisible, suddenly showed itself. Jesus began to glow like a great white light. While he was in this “transfigured” （changed） condition, Moses the lawgiver, and Elijah the greatest prophet joined him. They discussed together Jesus' death. This event gave Jesus the comfort and strength he needed to continue on toward his death.

夜里门徒们都睡了，耶稣通常隐藏的神性突然显现。他开始发出极大的白色光芒。当他变了形象的时候，颁布律法的摩西和伟大的先知以利亚加入此列。他们一起讨论耶稣的死亡。他需继续面对他的死亡，这件事给耶稣带来安慰和力量。

While Jesus was transfigured the disciples woke up and saw him. Not knowing what to do or say, Peter suggested that he build little shelters for the glorious trio.

当耶稣变了形象的时候，他的门徒们醒了过来并看到他。彼得手足无措，随即建议说他可以为这荣耀的三位支搭帐篷。

We may wonder why only these three disciples were blessed with this experience, just as they had been singled out once before （Luke 8:51-56）。 Perhaps it was to help prepare them also for their later lives. James would be the first disciple to die for his faith （Acts 12:2）。 The knowledge of Jesus' resurrection and this vision of glory must have given him strength during his own death! Peter was the most important missionary to the Jews. He also would be put to death by ungodly men. The sight of the glorified Jesus made him bold to confess him as the Messiah （cf 2 Pet. 1:16-18）。 Finally, for John the transfiguration was a proof that Jesus was God （John 1:14）， and it was a source of strength for him as well. He was the last disciple to die. While exiled to an island and separated from fellow believers, he could remember the glory which awaits the faithful, even the glory of Moses and Elijah （Rev. 1:9）。

我们也许想知道为什么只是这三个门徒有福气经历此事，就像他们此前也有一次被挑选出来一样（路加福音8:51-56）。也许这也是帮助他们为稍后的生活做好准备。雅各将是第一个为了信心而死的门徒（使徒行传12:2）。耶稣复活的信息和这荣耀的显现，一定在他死亡的时候给了他莫大的力量。彼得是犹太人中最重要的使徒。他也会被异教徒杀死。充满荣耀的景象使他勇敢地宣告，耶稣就是弥赛亚（参看彼得后书1:16-18）。最后，对于约翰来说，登山变相证明了耶稣就是上帝（约翰福音1:14），这对于他来说同样是个力量的源泉。他是门徒中最后一个死的。当被放逐到海岛上，远离他的信徒们时，他能够回忆起那等候忠实者的荣耀，就像摩西和以利亚的荣耀一样（启示录1:9）。

#### Healing the Boy with a Demon （Matt. 17:14-20; Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43） 医治被鬼附的男孩（马太福音17:14-20;马可福音9:14-29;路加福音9:37-43）

The next morning, Jesus and his disciples quietly walked back down the mountain. At the bottom, however, they found a large crowd gathered.

第二天一早，耶稣和门徒们安静地下山返回。然而，在山脚的时候他们遇到一大群人聚集在那里。

Jesus soon learned that in the crowd was a poor young boy. He could not talk or hear; he had symptoms of epilepsy; and he was demon-possessed. Furthermore, the disciples had not been able to help him.

Jesus was angered by the merciless, miracle seeking crowd. He had mercy on the father and his only son. As usual, Jesus strengthened the faith of the father and cured the boy.

耶稣马上知晓在人群中有一个可怜的青年。他听不见也无法说话，还伴随有癫痫的症状；他被鬼所附。同时，门徒们完全没有办法帮助他。

耶稣因为这无情的、寻找神迹的人群激怒。他怜悯了这父亲和他的独生子。像往常一样，耶稣坚固了这个父亲的信心，并治愈了他的孩子。

#### Jesus Again Prophecies His Death and Resurrection （Matt. 17:22-23; Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45） 耶稣再次预言他的死亡和复活（马太福音17:22-23;马可福音9:30-32;路加福音9:43-45）

As mentioned earlier, the death of John the Baptist was a turning point in Jesus' life. From then on Jesus became firmly convinced that soon he must suffer and die for the sins of man. Jesus continued to think about his suffering, death, and resurrection. After leaving the crowd and the healed boy behind, Jesus continued to teach the disciples about the sorrowful, yet glorious days ahead.

像之前提到过的，施洗约翰的死是耶稣生命中的一个转折点。从那时起耶稣开始坚信不久之后他必须受苦，并未所有罪人而死。耶稣不断地思想他的受苦、死亡和复活。当离开人群和被医治的男孩儿之后，耶稣继续教导他的门徒未来那充满忧伤，但是满有荣耀的日子。

#### Paying the Temple Tax （Matt. 17:24-27; Mark 9:33） 交付圣殿税（马太福音17:24-27;马可福音9:33）

Perhaps it was mid-September when Jesus and his disciples left the area of Caesarea Philippi. They traveled along the west side of the Sea of Galilee until they came to Capernaum. There Peter was met by a tax collector.

可能是在九月中旬，耶稣和他的门徒们离开了凯撒利亚腓立比地区。他们沿着加利利海的西侧前行，直到他们来到迦百农。在这里彼得与一个税吏相遇。

Every Jewish male over 20 years of age had to pay a tax each year to support the temple in Jerusalem （Exod. 30:12-16）。 While the tax was generally collected during the Passover festival, Peter and Jesus had not yet paid.

每一个年龄在20岁以上的犹太男性，每年必须支付税赋，以支持耶路撒冷的圣殿（出埃及记30:12-16）。虽然这项税赋通常在逾越节期间征收，彼得和耶稣都还没有缴纳。

Jesus showed how silly the situation was. A king's subjects, not the king's children, pay for the upkeep on the palace. The Jerusalem temple was God the Father's house. Jesus was his Son, yet he was expected to pay the tax. Nevertheless, to obey the law, Jesus produced money for Peter and himself from the mouth of a fish.

耶稣表明这件事是多么的愚蠢。是国王的臣民们支付宫殿的维护保养的费用，而非国王的孩子们。耶路撒冷的圣殿是天父上帝的家。耶稣是上帝的儿子，然而人们希望他缴纳税赋。虽然如此，为了遵守法律，耶稣给彼得和他自己在一条鱼的嘴里“找到”了些钱。

#### Teaching the Disciples （Matt. 18:1-35; Mark 9:33-50; Luke 9:46-50） 教导门徒（马太福音18:1-35;马可福音9:33-50;路加福音9:46-50）

Jesus had withdrawn several times in order to think about his work and death. At the same time he wanted to continue teaching his disciples. Scripture describes some of the issues Jesus discussed with his disciples near the end of his fourth withdrawal.

为了思想他的工作和死亡，耶稣已经多次远离人群。与此同时他希望不断地教导他的门徒们。在接近第四次“撤退”尾声时，经文中记载了一些耶稣与他的门徒们讨论的话题。

About who was most important. The disciples debated “which of them would be the greatest” （Luke 9:46）。 The answer: a person becomes great by being humble, not seeking glory for himself.

关于谁最重要。门徒们争论“谁将为大”（路加福音9:46）。答案是：一个人的伟大是因为谦卑，而不是为自己谋求荣耀。

About true and false teachers. John noted “we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us” （Luke 9:49）。 The answer: service in Christ's name, not a ranking with the apostles, is God-pleasing.

关于真假师傅。约翰提示说：“我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不与我们一同跟随你。”（路加福音9:49）。答案是：上帝所喜悦的是因着基督之名的服侍，而不是与使徒同列。

About giving offense. Jesus gave a stern warning about giving offense and causing others to lose their faith. He also showed the foolishness of allowing temptations to continue, temptations which could cause a person to fall from faith.

关于冒犯。得罪人和使人失去信心的情况被耶稣严厉地警告。耶稣还展示了允许试探继续下去的愚蠢，试探会让一个人失去信心。

About the value of the individual. Looking at a little child, Jesus spoke of the value of individual souls. The tiny child is important to God and must not be prevented from coming to him. The lost sheep must be returned to the sheep pen. How far should believers go to return a brother to the flock? Jesus explained the proper steps in disciplining church members.

关于个人的价值。耶稣一边看着一个小孩子，一遍谈论每个灵魂的价值。一个幼小的孩子在上帝那里是重要的，一定不要阻止他到上帝那里去。丢失的羊一定要被带回羊圈。在什么范围内，信徒们应该将一个弟兄带回到到人群中呢？耶稣讲解了操练教会会众合适的步骤。

About forgiveness. Peter asked how often he should forgive someone who sinned against him. Jesus answered: always. Speaking in a parable Christ taught Peter that when the issue of forgiving someone arises he should remember the debt God has forgiven him.

关于宽恕。彼得问道，他应该饶恕那得罪了他的人多少次。耶稣回答说：永远饶恕。通过一个比喻基督教导彼得，当每一次他饶恕别人时，他应该想起他的债都已被上帝免除了。
