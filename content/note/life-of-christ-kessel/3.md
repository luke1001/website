#### Introduction 概述

In the last chapters we studied the first year of Jesus' public ministry. It was a year in which he moved from being unknown to well-known. During the next three months （January through March of A.D. 28） Jesus carried on an active ministry among the people of Galilee. Most people received him favorably, but at the same time some opposition also began to appear.

在上一章我们学习了耶稣公开传道的第一年。这一年他从不被人们认识到被熟知。在接下来的三个月（公元28年1月到3月）耶稣继续在加利利一带公开传道。大多数人愿意接受他，但同时一些反对者也开始出现。

#### The Woman at the Well （Matt. 4:12; Mark 2:24; Luke 4:14; John 4:1-42） 井边的妇人（太4:12;可2:24;路4:14;约4:-42）

Some people think the events of Jesus' early ministry happened mostly by accident. This, however, is not true. When Jesus left heaven and became human, he already had a clear picture of the saving work he had to do. So from the very beginning all of his traveling, deeds and teaching were done just to carry out that ministry.

有些人认为耶稣早期的传道大多是偶然发生的。然而事实并非如此。当耶稣离开天堂并成为人类时，对于他必须要做的拯救就已经有了清晰的蓝图。所以从最开始，他所有的活动、行为、教导都只是为了完成那项使命。

Jesus began his public ministry in Jerusalem, the center of Old Testament worship. By cleansing the temple he showed himself to be the Lord of the temple, the long awaited Messiah. Throughout Judea John the Baptist had already preached against the false teachings （heresy） of the Jewish religious leaders. Now Jesus came proclaiming the true Gospel of salvation.

耶稣从耶路撒冷开始公开传道，这是旧约中敬拜的中心。通过洁净圣殿，他向人们显示了自己是圣殿的主人，是人们一直期待降临的弥赛亚。在整个犹太地区，施洗约翰已经公开反对犹太教领袖的错误教导（异端）。现在耶稣来宣告救赎的真正福音。

The Old Testament prophecies foretold that the Messiah would come to the Jews, but not to the Jews only （Is. 42:6; 49:6）。 As Simeon said, Jesus was to be the “glory of his people Israel” but also “a light for revelation to the Gentiles” （Luke 2:32）。 Thus, after beginning his work among the Israelites, Jesus set out for the Jewish province of Galilee. First, however, he paused in the Gentile region of Samaria.

旧约先知预言弥赛亚要来到犹太人中间，但并不仅限于犹太人（赛42:6;49:6）。正如西门所言，耶稣是“以色列民的荣耀”,也是“照亮外邦人的光”（路2:32）。因此，耶稣在以色列人中开始事工之后，出发到了加利利的犹太人聚集区。然而他首先在外邦人的撒马利亚停留了一下。

Most Jews traveling north from Judea felt it was necessary to avoid Samaria. Some seven centuries earlier Israelites had lived in this area, then called Samaria. However when the Assyrians conquered the area they deported many of the Jews and replaced them with pagan peoples （2 Kings 17）。 Soon the Jews who were still living in Samaria began intermarrying with the unbelievers. Soon their true religion also was mixed with other false beliefs.

大多数从犹太地向北移居的犹太人感觉有必要避开撒马利亚人。大约在7世纪早期以色列人居住在这个地区，后来称作撒马利亚。然而当亚述人攻克这地时，他们驱逐出了很多犹太人，取而代之的是异教徒（列下17）。很快仍然居住在撒马利亚的犹太人开始与不信的人通婚。同样他们的真信仰也很快与其他错误的信仰混合。

In Jesus' day the Samaritan's Bible was made up of the first five books of the Old Testament. They also worshiped Jehovah, but also they allowed pagan beliefs and idols. Their center of worship was the top of Mt. Gerizim, not the temple in Jerusalem. Consequently, the Jews looked down on the Samaritans. And the Samaritans in turn hated the Jews.

在耶稣时代撒马利亚人的圣经由旧约的前五卷组成。他们也敬拜耶和华，但他们也允许异教徒和拜偶像。他们崇拜的中心在基利心山的山顶，而不在耶路撒冷的圣殿。因此，犹太人轻看撒马利亚人。而撒马利亚人转而憎恨犹太人。

But Jesus would not take part in ethnic hatred. He viewed the Samaritans just as he did the Jews all were sinners in need of a savior. Interestingly, he chose a very sinful woman to evangelize on this trip.

但是耶稣不参与种族仇恨。在他眼中撒马利亚人和犹太人一样都是需要拯救的罪人。有趣的是，在这次旅途中，他选择了一个罪孽深重的妇人作为传福音的对象。

When we look closely, we can see Jesus' excellent evangelism skills with the woman at the well. He made her curious, making her interested in something she didn't have （John 4:4-15）。 Next, he showed her her sins and encouraged her to confess her guilt （vv. 16-19）。 Finally, avoiding an argument about worship methods, he told her he was the Messiah, the true and living God （vv 20-26）。

当我们更严密地看这段经文时，会发现耶稣在给这位井边的妇人传福音时，显示出了优秀的传福音技巧。耶稣让她好奇、让她对自己所没有的事情感兴趣（约4:4-15）。接下来他指出她得罪并鼓励她认罪（16-19节）。最后，为了避免有关敬拜方式的真论，他告诉那妇人他就是弥赛亚，那真正的、活生生的上帝（20-26节）。

The Samaritan woman's faith produced immediate fruits. She went to the people she knew and talked about the Savior. They came to Jesus, perhaps out of curiosity, but then believed his word of eternal life. Within two days many souls were saved.

这撒马利亚妇人的信心很快结出了果子。她到认识的人们那里跟他们谈论救世主。他们就来到耶稣面前，也许出于好奇心，但随后便信了他关于永生的话。两天之内很多灵魂得救了。

#### Jesus Preaches in Galilee （Matt. 4:27; Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15; John 4:43-45） 耶稣在加利利布道（太4:27;可1:14-15;路4:14-15;约4:43-45）

From Samaria Jesus and his disciples traveled north toward Galilee. Along the way Jesus let the disciples return to their homes and former occupations. Perhaps Jesus also spent some time resting after his first year of preaching.

离开撒马利亚，耶稣和他的门徒向北往加利利去。沿途耶稣让门徒回家或者从事以前的职业。也许在第一年的布道生活结束之后，耶稣也想花点时间休息一下。

However, Jesus was not to enjoy much rest and quiet. Many of the Galileans who earlier had seen him perform miracles in Jerusalem now recognized him. Soon news of his presence spread throughout Galilee.

然而，耶稣并没有充分地休息和安静一下。很多初期在耶路撒冷见过他行神迹的加利利人认出了他。耶稣来到加利利的消息很快就传开了。

#### Healing the Nobleman's Son （John 4:46-54） 医治大臣的儿子（约4:46-54）

In Cana Jesus was met by a certain nobleman whose son was sick. This man, possibly the man called Cuza in Luke 8:3, begged Jesus to come to Capernaum and heal the youth. The nobleman had a weak faith, one based on seeing miracles and not on the Word of Jesus Christ. The Lord knew this, so he sent him home with nothing but a word of hope and the promise, “You may go. Your son will live” （John 4:50）。 The nobleman believed, went home, and found his son healed. He and his entire household came to faith that day.

在迦拿耶稣见了一个大臣，他的儿子病了。这个大臣可能是路加福音8:3中提到的叫苦撒的人，他祈求耶稣到迦百农医治他儿子。这大臣信心小，而且他的信心基于想要看到神迹而不是耶稣基督的话语。主知道这点，所以他只给了大臣希望和承诺的话语，就打发大臣空手回家去了。“回去吧！你的儿子活了”（约4:50）。这大臣信了，回到家中，发现他儿子已经痊愈了。那日他和全家人都信了。

#### Rejection in Nazareth （Matt. 14:3-5; Mark 6:19-20; Luke 3:19-20; 4:16-30） 耶稣在拿撒勒被拒（太14:3-5;可6:19-20;路3:19-20;4:16-30）

Perhaps while Jesus was in Cana he received word that John the Baptist had been arrested. King Herod had imprisoned him at the fortress of Machaerus near the Dead Sea. The forerunner's task was complete. Now it was time for Jesus to begin his great Galilean ministry.

也许耶稣还在迦拿的时候就听到施洗约翰被捕的消息。希律王把约翰关押在死海附近的马卡鲁斯城堡里。约翰预备主的道路的任务完成了。现在是耶稣开始他伟大的加利利人传道的时候了。

As Jesus walked toward Nazareth one thought was on his mind --“a prophet has no honor in his own country.” That proverb was fulfilled on the Sabbath day when Jesus entered the synagogue in Nazareth. He knew the place well, having worshiped there since he was a child. Inside, the men sat on one side with the women hidden behind a screen on the other. Near the middle of the room there was a raised area with a speaker's stand and seat. To the south was a painted box （ark） which contained the sacred Scriptures.

当耶稣走向拿撒勒的时候，有一个想法映入脑中——“先知在他的家乡没有荣耀。”这一点在安息日耶稣进入拿撒勒的会堂时应验了。他很了解这个地方，从孩童时代他就在这里敬拜上帝。在会堂里，男人坐在一边，妇人则躲在屏幕后坐在另外一边。在房子中间有一个突起的地方，是讲道的人站和坐的地方。在南边是一只彩色的盒子（约柜），摆放着神圣的经文。

The service opened with a blessing followed by a creed, and then prayers. The leader then moved from the speaker's stand to the altar and offered a series of prayers for the day. Since Jesus was asked to give the sermon he was probably asked to conduct this portion off the service as well. After the prayers, one of Aaron's descendants, if one was present, pronounced the Aaronic Blessing （Num. 6:22-26）。 This ended the liturgy.

敬拜由祝福开始，接下来是宣讲教义，然后祷告。祷告之后司会的人就从讲道人站立的地方走到圣坛，报告这一天的祷告事项。既然耶稣被要求做讲道，那么他可能同样也被要求完成这些仪式内容。祷告结束之后，如果有亚伦的后代在场，那么就宣告亚纶人的祝福（民6:22-26）。以此结束礼拜仪式。

The teaching part of the service began with seven men reading parts of the Law （the first five books of the Old Testament）。 Next Jesus walked to the speaker's stand where he was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. He unrolled the scroll and read Isaiah 61:1-2. Meanwhile the congregation stood quietly and listened. When the reading was over Jesus sat in the speaker's seat and the people also sat down.

教导的部分以7个人读部分律法开始（即旧约的前五章）。接下来耶稣走到布道的位置，接过先知书以赛亚书。他展开书卷，朗读以赛亚书61:1-2.会众则安静站立聆听。读经结束后耶稣坐在讲道人的座位上，会众也坐下。

Jesus explained the good news in his text. He announced that he was the long awaited Messiah spoken of in those verses. At first the congregation was amazed, but soon they became angry. It those days the men often openly expressed themselves in the service. Soon there was mumbling. Then the sounds of anger grew louder. The people said that Jesus was just a simple carpenter's son. They demanded miracles as proof of his claim. Jesus tried to show the people the error of their ways, but they would not listen.

耶稣在主题中解释好消息（福音）。他宣告自己就是人们一直等待的弥赛亚，正如那些旧约章节中所说到的。刚开始的时候会众大为惊奇，但是很快他们就变得生气了。在那个时代，男人经常在礼拜仪式上公开表达自己的想法。很快会众中开始出现咕哝声。后来生气的声音开始大了。人们说耶稣只不过是一个单纯的木匠的儿子。于是他们就要求耶稣用神迹来证明他所声称的。耶稣试图向会众表明他们这样做是错的，但是会众不愿听从他。

By then the congregation had become a mob. They dragged Jesus from the synagogue and took him to a rocky cliff at the edge of the town. They wanted to throw him to his death, but his time to die had not yet come. Jesus walked through the midst of the mob and quietly left Nazareth.

那时会众成了乌合之众。他们把耶稣赶出教堂，把他带到城边的一个石崖边。他们想把耶稣扔下去，但是还不到他死的时候。耶稣从会众中间走过，安静地离开了拿撒勒。

#### Calling of Four Apostles （Matt. 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20） 呼召四个使徒（太4:18-22;可1:16-20）

From Nazareth Jesus then went to Capernaum which now became his home. Capernaum was an ideal base for Jesus' mission work. It a very important city in Galilee. Located on the shores of the Sea of Galilee it was home for many fishermen. It was situated along the chief road between the important city of Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea. It was a center for trade, commerce, and communication. The city was so important that it became the center for collecting taxes and a group of Roman soldiers was stationed there. Years later St. Paul followed Jesus' example and used important cities as centers for his ministry.

耶稣从拿撒勒去了迦百农，就是成为现在他的家的地方。对于耶稣完成使命的事工来说，迦百农是理想的奠基。迦百农是加利利地区非常重要的一座城市。坐落在加利利海边的迦百农是很多渔民的家。这条交通要道在连接于大马士革和地中海的重要城市之间。是贸易、商业和交通的中心。迦百农如此重要到，以致成为税收的中心，一群罗马士兵驻扎在这里。几年后圣保罗效仿耶稣，同样也把迦百农作为他宣教的中心。

One day while walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee Jesus spotted his friends Peter and Andrew. His message to them was simple, “Come, follow me and I will make you fishers of men” （Matt. 4:19）。 Before he had called them to be his followers, now he was calling them to be his helpers. A little further along the shore he saw James and John and called them as well.

有一天，耶稣走在加利利海的岸边，他发现了朋友彼得和安得烈。耶稣给他们的信息很简单“来，跟从我！我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样”（太4:19）。之前耶稣呼召他们跟从他，现在呼召他们成为助手。沿着海岸没过多远，耶稣见到了雅各和约翰，也同样呼召了他们。

#### Miracle of Fish （Luke 5:1-11） 打渔的奇迹（路5:1-11）

Soon a crowd had gathered around Jesus. In order to be more easily seen and heard he climbed into an empty fishing boat and had Peter push it a few feet off from shore. Sitting down, he began to preach the Gospel message.

很快耶稣身边就聚集了人群。为了能够让大家更容易看到、听到，他爬进一艘空的渔船，让彼得撑开船，稍微离岸。坐下后开始传讲福音。

When the sermon was over, he had Peter go out into deep water and let down the fishing nets. While fishing usually had its best results at night and near the shore, Peter still obeyed. Immediately the nets were filled with fish. Seeing what had happened, Peter's fishing partners went out in a second boat. The fish filled both boats until they nearly sunk. Amazed by the miracle, Peter cried out “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man” （Luke 5:8）！

讲道结束之后，他让彼得把船开到水深的地方，下网打渔。尽管通常情况下在夜里和靠近岸边的地方最容易打上鱼来，但彼得还是听从了耶稣。很快网就满了鱼。看到所发生的这一切，彼得的伙伴又开了一艘船来。鱼装满了两艘船，甚至船要沉下去。彼得为这奇迹所震惊，大喊说：“主啊，离开我，我是个罪人”（路5:8）！

This was clearly the wrong way to think. Sinners must seek Jesus' presence for the forgiveness of sins, not order him to go away. The proper response is that of the hymn writer Magnus B. Landstad who wrote:

这明显是错误的思考方式。罪人必然会寻找耶稣以获得赦免，而不是让主离开。正常的反应就如赞美诗作家马格努斯B. 兰德斯泰德所写的：

When sinners see their lost condition

And feel the pressing load of sin,

And Jesus comes upon his mission

To heal the sin-sick heart within,

All grief must flee before his grace

And joy divine will take its place.

罪人迷失时

倍感罪的压力

耶稣要完成他的使命

医治因罪受伤的心灵

在他的恩典中所有的罪得释放

来自属天的喜乐代替所有悲伤

But Jesus did not get angry with Peter. He simply stated, “Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men” （Luke 5:10）。

但耶稣没有生彼得的气。他简单地说道：“不要怕，从今以后，你要得人了”（路5:10）

#### Miracles in Capernaum （Matt.8:14-17; Mark 1:21-34; Luke 4:31-41） 在迦百农行神迹（太8:14-17;可1:21-34;路4:31-41）

So we have studied three miracles of Jesus: changing water into wine at Cana, healing the nobleman's son, and now catching a full boat of fish. Later, in one day alone, he cast a demon from a man who had entered the synagogue in Capernaum, healed Peter's mother-in-law, and that evening healed many and cast out many demons （Mark 1:21-34）。

到此我们已经学习了耶稣的三个神迹：在迦拿把水变成酒，医治大臣的儿子，打满一船的鱼。后来，在一天里，耶稣在迦百农的会堂里从一个男人身上赶走了鬼，医治彼得岳母的，在那天晚上医治了很多人，赶出很多鬼（可1:21-34）

Notice that Jesus did not work miracles to win the favor of the people. Sometimes he did his mighty works of love simply to help someone in need. At other times his wonders showed that he was God and the promised Messiah. But most of his miracles did both of these at the same time. For example, at the wedding in Cana he kept a young couple from being embarrassed. Yet, by doing this, he proved that he was the Son of God.

我们注意到耶稣并没通过行神迹去赢得人们的喜欢。有时候他只是出于爱而帮助有需要的人。而在另外一些时候，他的神迹表明了他就是上帝，就是将来的弥赛亚。但他所行的大多数神迹则同时具有这两个特点。比如，在迦拿的婚礼上，他让一对年轻夫妇脱离窘境。然而，通过神迹他证明了自己就是上帝的儿子。

We should also note that Jesus never did miracles in anger. In Old Testament times prophets frequently did mighty works showing God's anger towards sinful men （Num. 16:31; 2 Kings 1:10-12）。 Jesus, on the other hand, was against this （Luke 9:54-56）。 He only performed signs of grace and mercy.

我们也应该注意到耶稣永远都不在怒气中行神迹。在旧约时代，先知经常行神迹，显明上帝对罪恶的人类的怒气（民16:31;列下1:10-12）。另一方面，耶稣反对这样做（路9:54-56）。他只代表恩典和怜悯。

#### First Tour of Galilee （Matt. 4:23-25; Mark 1:35-45; Luke 4:42-44; 5:12-16） 第一次走遍加利利（太4:23-25;可1:35-45;路4:42-44;5:12-16）

After spending a few days in Capernaum Jesus decided to take his ministry throughout Galilee. He thought that the people of Capernaum needed some time to think about all they had seen and heard. Meanwhile he would go from town to town preaching the Gospel. Jesus did not arrive at this decision easily. It came only after hours of quiet prayer （Mark 1:35）。 As we have seen, the Lord always prayed before making major decisions.

在迦百农呆了几天后，耶稣决定要在整个加利利传道。他认为迦百农的人们需要一段时间思想所看到的和听到的。同时，他要从一个城市到另一个城市去传讲福音。耶稣并不是轻易地做了这个决定。而是静静地祷告了几个小时后的结果（可1:35）。正如我们所看到的，我们的主在做重大决定之前总是要祷告。

Jesus preached and performed miracles throughout Galilee. His acts of mercy, however, could at times cause problems for his teaching. One example can be seen in the story of a leper.

耶稣在整个加利利布道、行神迹。然而他的怜悯有时也给布道带来麻烦。在有关麻风病人的故事中我们能找到一个例子。

Leprosy was a very terrible disease. People with leprosy were considered the living dead. Leprosy first attacked the skin, leaving sores and raised lumps. Then it attacked the soft parts of the mouth and throat. Finally, as the disease got worse, the victim's hair would fall out. His nose and lips would be eaten away, and his bones and joints would begin to rot.

麻风是一种非常恐怖的疾病。得了麻风病的人被认为是活着的死人。麻风病首先会侵袭皮肤，非常痛而且有凸起的肿块。然后会进一步侵袭嘴和喉咙的软组织部分。最终，病情恶化，病人的头发会脱落。鼻子和嘴唇也会被腐蚀掉，骨头和关节开始腐烂。

One day as Jesus was walking along, a man “covered with leprosy” suddenly came up to him. Jesus reached out and touched him, and immediately the disease disappeared. Christ sent the man to the priest to be declared clean. But first he ordered him not to tell anyone what had happened. Jesus did not want people only to think about the miracles he did. He wanted them to think more about the message he was preaching. But what Jesus had feared took place. The man talked freely. As a result, crowds of sick and curious people gathered in every city where Jesus went. “As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere” （Mark 1:45）。

一天耶稣正走着的时候，一个“得了大麻风”的人突然来到他面前。耶稣伸出手摸他，这病立即消失了。基督让这个人去找大祭司并给他看。耶稣却首先要他不要跟别人讲这件事。耶稣不想让人们仅仅想到他所行得神迹。他想要他们更多地思想他所传道的信息。但耶稣担心的事情发生了。这个被医治的人倒说了很多。结果是耶稣每到一个城市，都聚集了生病的和好奇的人们。“叫耶稣以后不得再明明地进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来”（可1:45）。

#### Healing of a Paralytic （Matt. 9:2-8; Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26） 医治瘫子（太9:2-8;可2:1-12;路5:17-26）

After many days, perhaps weeks, Jesus returned to Capernaum. Soon a crowd gathered. But not all of these people were local people. Pharisees and Scribes from various Galilean towns and from far away Jerusalem had traveled to hear and see him. Many of these men were religious leaders. They wanted to keep an eye on Jesus.

过了很多天，大概有几周的时间，耶稣回到迦百农。就有许多人聚集。并非都是当地人。有法利赛人和教法师，他们从加利利各乡村和从遥远的耶路撒冷赶来的，为的是听耶稣讲道，看看耶稣。很多人都是宗教领袖。他们想要注意耶稣的举动。

An unusual event took place one day while Jesus was preaching to a large gathering inside Peter's house. Four men had promised to help their paralyzed friend by taking him to Jesus. But a large crowd blocked the doors so they could not get close to Jesus. Instead they carried their paralyzed friend up the outside stairs to the top of the flat roof. Then they removed some of the roof tiles, and using ropes lowered him down on a mattress.

有一天，耶稣正在彼得家给很多聚集起来的人讲道的时候，一件非同寻常的事儿发生了。一个瘫子的四个朋友答应帮助他来到耶稣面前。但人太多了，堵住了门，所以他们无法接近耶稣。他们抬着瘫痪的朋友上了外面的楼梯，到达平的屋顶。然后他们移走了一些瓦，用绳子连同床垫一起坠到房子里。

Jesus, however, didn't just cure the man. Instead he said something very unexpected: “Friend, your sins are forgiven” （Luke 5:20）。 The Pharisees and Scribes immediately became angry. They thought, “Who can forgive sins but God alone?” But that was the point Jesus was trying to make. Jesus was himself truly God. Then Christ healed the man. On that day the Lord gave a public show of his divine authority to forgive sins and of his power to heal.

耶稣当然并不仅仅是医治了这个瘫子。他说了让人意想不到的话：“朋友，你的罪赦了”（路5:20）。法利赛人和文士即刻就生气了。他们想，“除了神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”这正是耶稣想要说的。耶稣本人就是真神。然后基督医治了瘫子。那天主公开显明他的神赐的赦罪权柄，还有医治的力量。

#### Call of Matthew （Matt. 9:9-13; Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32） 呼召马太（太9:9-13;可2:13-17;路5:27-32）

Jesus spent that evening with some of the religious leaders of Israel. Soon after, he was surrounded by people who were not respected in society. They were well known as sinners, and were dinner guests of a man called Levi.

那夜耶稣和一些以色列的宗教领袖一起度过。很快他被那些在社会上不怎么受人尊重的人围绕着。他们是众所周知的罪人，也同样是利未宴请的客人。

Earlier that day Jesus had preached near the Sea of Galilee. Close by was the great highway running north to Damascus. Since this road was heavily traveled by merchants, the Roman government had set up toll booths. There tax collectors gathered import and export fees. These tax collectors often cheated people. They also worked for the Roman government. As a result, the Jews hated them.

前一天耶稣已经在加利利海附近传道。附近就是去北面大马士革的大路。既然这条路有大量的商人经过，罗马政府自然设立了收税站。在这儿税吏收取进出口费。这些税吏经常骗人。他们也是为罗马政府工作的。当然犹太人憎恨他们。

When Jesus passed the tax collector Levi, he said, “Follow me” （Matt. 9:9）。 Levi did follow Jesus. Shortly afterwards he invited Jesus and his disciples to a dinner also attended by his friends. When the Pharisees and Scribes heard of this they became angry. Jesus' response to them has warmed the hearts of repentant sinners to this day. “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance” （Luke 5:31-32）。

当耶稣从税吏利未身边经过时，他说：“跟从我”（太9:9）利未就跟从了耶稣。随后他立刻邀请耶稣和他的门徒到家里吃晚餐，他的朋友们也参加。当法利赛人和文士听说这件事时就发怒。耶稣的反应至今为止都温暖着认罪悔改人的心。“无病的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着。我来本不是召义人悔改，乃是召罪人悔改”（路5:31-2）。

#### Lesson on Fasting （Matt. 9:14-17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39） 有关禁食的教导（太9:14-17;可2:18-22;路5:33-39）

It was becoming more and more clear that Jesus' teaching and life was very different from the religion practiced by the Pharisees. Among other things, Jesus did not encourage his disciples to fast. When he was asked about this, his answer was simple. Since Jesus was with his disciples now in person, it was not the right time to fast. Fasting was done to show grief and sorrow. After Jesus returned to heaven, then his disciples could fast.

耶稣有关生活的教导与法利赛人所精通的宗教教导之间的不同越来越明显了。在耶稣所教导的诸多事情之中，他并不鼓励门徒禁食。当他被询问禁食的事儿时，他的回答很简单。既然现在耶稣亲自和门徒在一起，那就不是禁食的好时候。禁食用来显明悲伤和悔恨。耶稣回到天堂之后，他的门徒才应当禁食。
