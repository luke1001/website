#### Introduction  简介

The Gospel Accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John span the 33 years of Jesus' life. Yet more than one quarter of all they wrote describes but one week – Holy Week. This is not surprising. Christ came to earth to be the Good Shepherd, to lay down his life for the sheep （John 10:11; Zech 13:7-9）。 In this chapter we begin our study of Holy Week. However, on the day before Palm Sunday, a special event took place which we must not quickly pass over. Jesus' body was prepared for the grave.

马太、马可、路加和约翰福四卷福音书的记载跨越了耶稣33年的生活。然而他们却用了超过四分之一的篇幅来描绘仅仅一周的事件——圣周。这并不意外。基督来到世间要成为好的牧者，为羊舍命（约翰福音10:11;撒加利亚书13:7-9）。在这章中，我们开始圣周的学习。但是，在棕枝主日的前一天，一件特别的事情发生了，使我们无法视而不见。耶稣的身体已为死亡做好了准备。

#### Jesus Anointed at Bethany （Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 11:55-12:11） 耶稣在伯大尼被膏（马太福音26:6-13;马可福音14:3-9;约翰福音11:55-12:11）

Jesus had spent Thursday night at the home of Zacchaeus in Jericho. The next day he and the disciples made the 14 mile walk to Bethany, arriving sometime before sunset. That evening and the next day they relaxed at the home of Simon whom Jesus had cured of leprosy. Simon was either a relative or friend of Lazarus, Mary and Martha who all lived in that same town.

在耶利哥城撒该的家中，耶稣度过了星期四的晚上。第二天他和门徒们走了十四英里的路程，在日落前的某个时候来到了伯大尼。当天晚上以及第二天，他们都悠闲地呆在西门家中，耶稣曾洁净了西门的大麻风。西门也是拉撒路的亲戚或朋友，马利亚和马大也都住在伯大尼。

That evening, April 1, A.D. 30, a feast was held in Jesus' honor. Not surprisingly, Martha served. Mary, however, did something very unusual. She produced a bottle of very expensive perfume, and poured it on Jesus' head and feet. Jewish women did not let their hair down in public. Nevertheless, Mary wiped the perfume from Jesus' feet with her long hair.

公元30年四月一日的那个夜晚，为了向耶稣表达敬意，有人预备了筵席。马大不出意料地服事着。然而，马利亚做了些不寻常的事情。她做了一瓶异常昂贵的香膏，并用香膏抹耶稣的头和脚。犹太妇女从来不会在公众场合让头发垂下。然而，马利亚却用她的长头擦抹耶稣脚上的香膏。

How is it that Mary happened to have perfume worth one year's wages? Perhaps she had bought it to pour over Lazarus' body when he had died. But she never got the chance to use. Now she used the perfume to anoint the One who raised Lazarus from the dead.

马利亚怎么会有值一年收入的香膏呢？也许这是拉撒路死后，她买来要膏他尸体的。但是她没有机会使用这些香膏。现在，她用它们膏抹了使拉撒路从死里复活的那一位。

Why did Mary anoint Jesus? Because she loved him and wanted to show her thanks. Yet, to Jesus this was more than a show of love, it was also a prophecy. Mary had done her part to prepare Jesus' body for burial.

马利亚为什么要膏耶稣呢？因为她爱他，想要向他献上感激。但是，对于耶稣来说，被膏的意义要远远多于爱的表达，这也是一个预言。为了预备好耶稣的身体，不久后被埋葬，马利亚做完了她的那部分工作。

In the middle of this story of love we also see the beginning of evil. Judas put his love in money, not Jesus. In Jerusalem the Jewish leaders were waiting for Jesus, waiting to kill him.

在这个爱的故事中，我们也看到邪恶开始了它的工作。犹大爱慕金钱，而不是耶稣。在耶路撒冷犹太的领袖们正在等候着耶稣，等着将他杀死。

#### Palm Sunday  棕枝主日

Jesus' Triumphal Entry （Matt. 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:29-44; John 12:12-19）

Ride on, ride on, in majesty!

In lowly pomp ride on to die.

O Christ, thy triumphs now begin

O'er captive death and conquered sin.

Ride on, ride on, in majesty!

Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;

The Father on his sapphire throne

Expects his own anointed Son.


耶稣荣耀地进入圣城（马太福音21:1-11;马可福音11:1-11;路加福音19:29-44;约翰福音12:12-19）

骑行，骑行，带着无上的威荣

在卑微的盛况中向死亡骑行

噢 基督，凯旋已经奏响

胜过死亡的毒勾，胜过罪恶的辖制

骑行，骑行，带着无上的威荣

最后的战役来临，惨烈的战役来临

天父在那玉石的宝座上

期待着自己所膏的圣子归来

This hymn was written by Henry Milman. His words describe how the time had come for Jesus to complete his saving work. Several times he had told the disciples of his death. Now it was time for him to finish his self-sacrifice （Heb. 7:27）。

这首赞美诗的作者是亨利·米尔曼（Henry Milman）。他的歌词描述了耶稣完成他救赎工作的时刻是怎样地到来了。耶稣已经多次将他的死亡告诉给门徒们。现在，是时候将自己献上了（希伯来书7:27）。

On Sunday, April 2, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey. A crowd greeted him by waving palm branches and singing “Hosanna.” It was a proper way for the Lamb of God to enter the city. It was the day when the Jews selected a lamb to be killed for the Passover meal （Exod. 12:3）。

四月二日，星期天，耶稣骑在驴驹的背上进入了耶路撒冷。人群挥舞着棕榈枝，高唱着“和散那”向他致敬。这是上帝的羔羊进入圣城应有的样子。这是犹太人选出待宰的羔羊，享用逾越节晚宴的日子。

In ancient times, kings entered into cities by riding their horses or chariots surrounded by their soldiers. On Palm Sunday Jesus rode on a donkey surrounded by his disciples. The great Prince of Peace made his way not in glory but in humility. The people waved their palm branches before the Lord. Palm branches were symbols of military victory, but Jesus came to fight sin, death, and the power of the devil. The crowd shouted the well-known words of Psalm 118:25-26, “Hosanna” （meaning 'Oh, save us now‘） and expected to be freed from Roman rule. While Jesus accepted their “Hosannas” he knew he had come to free their souls. This was Jesus' day to be honored, yet he wept tears of sorrow when viewing Jerusalem. The city was beautiful, its inhabitants were not.

古时候，国王都是骑着高头大马，或坐在战车中，被士兵簇拥着进入一座城市的。在棕枝主日，耶稣骑着一头驴驹，被他的门徒围绕着。伟大的平安之子没有选择荣耀，而是谦卑地到来。人们在主的前面挥动着他们的棕榈枝。棕榈树枝是军队凯旋的象征，但是耶稣是来与罪、死亡和魔鬼的权势征战。人群高喊着诗篇118:25节中著名的篇章，“和散那”（意思是“噢，现在拯救我们”）并期待着可以脱离罗马的统治。当耶稣受用他们喊出的“和散那”时，他知道此行的目的是释放他们的灵魂。这一天，耶稣当受尊荣；然而，当他看到耶路撒冷时，他流出了哀伤的眼泪。这座城市是美丽的，但是居住其中的人却不是如此。

As evening came, Jesus entered the temple, noticed the money changers and the animals waiting to be sold for sacrifice, then left. He returned to Bethany for the night.

夜幕降临时，耶稣进入圣殿，他注意到兑换银钱的人们和等待被当作祭物出售的动物们，然后离开了那里。当晚耶稣返回伯大尼过夜。

#### Holy Monday  神圣的星期一

#### Cursing the Fig Tree （Matt. 21:18-19; Mark 11:12-14） 诅咒无花果树（马太福音21:18-19;马可福音11:12-14）

0n the morning of Monday, April 3, Jesus walked toward Jerusalem. He was very hungry when he came to a fig tree that should have had winter figs. However there were none, so he cursed the tree.


在四月三日，星期一的早晨， 耶稣走向耶路撒冷。当他走到一棵本应长满冬果的无花果树旁时，耶稣感到非常的饥饿。然而树上什么也没有，所以耶稣诅咒了这棵树。

This was not an act of anger, but was a symbol and prophecy. Earlier Jesus had spoken a parable about a barren fig tree （Luke 13:6-9）。 Now he taught the same spiritual truth. Israel looked like a godly nation, but inside they had no fruits of repentance and faith. Thus, God would be forced to judge them.

这个行为并非出于愤怒，而是一个标志和预言。此前耶稣曾说过一个比喻，关于不结果实的无花果树（路加福音13:6-9）。现在他所教导的是同样属灵的真相。以色列看上去像是一个敬畏神的国度，但是实际上，他们没有结出任何信心和悔改的果实。因此，上帝不得不审判他们。

#### Second Cleansing of the Temple （Matt. 21:12-17; Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48） 第二次洁净圣殿（马太福音21:12-17;马可福音11:15-19;路加福音19:45-48）

From the fig tree Jesus went to the temple. At the start of his ministry he had cleaned the temple （see Chapter 2）。 Now, at the end, he was forced to do it again. Greed rather than worship and praise were to be seen everywhere. While the church leaders plotted Jesus' death, it was the little children who sang his praise.

离开无花果树，耶稣再次走向圣殿。在他刚开始公开宣教的时候他曾洁净过神殿（参看第二章）。现在，在最后，他被迫同样再做一次。任何地方都可以看到，贪婪代替了敬拜和赞美。当宗教领袖们策划杀害耶稣时，只有小孩子喊出了他的赞美。

Monday of Holy Week came and went. Jesus returned to Bethany to sleep.

圣周的星期一开始又结束了，耶稣回到了伯大尼过夜。

#### Holy Tuesday  神圣的星期二

#### The Withered Fig Tree （Matt. 21:19-22; Mark 11:20-26） 枯萎的无花果树（马太福音21:19-22;马可福音11:20-26）

Early the next morning Jesus and his disciples walked along the road to Jerusalem. The disciples saw the fig tree now completely withered away. They must have questioned how they might perform such miracles. Jesus quieted them by speaking of faith without doubt.

第二天一早，耶稣和门徒们向耶路撒冷走去。门徒们看到了完全枯萎的无花果树。他们一定稀奇这神迹是如何发生的。耶稣谈论起没有疑惑的信心，并使他们安静下来。

From there it was on to Jerusalem and Jesus' last full working day in the public ministry. It was his last day to visit the temple, teach, and give warning to the Pharisees and Sadducees. It was the last day for him to call the nation to repentance.

从那里到耶路撒冷，是耶稣公开传道的日子里最后一个完整的工作日。这是他最后一天进入圣殿，教导并警告法利赛人和撒都该人。这是他最后一天呼唤这个国家悔改。

#### A Question of Jesus' Authority （Matt. 21:23-27; Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8） 耶稣权柄的疑问（马太福音21:23-27;马可福音11:27-33;路加福音20:1-8）

Jesus had just entered the temple when he was surrounded by religious leaders. By what right did he ride into Jerusalem as the Messiah, clean the temple, and then preach there? These were their questions, but their idea was to condemn him to death. In answer, Jesus asked them who had sent John the Baptist on his mission. John, a prophet of God, had declared Jesus to be the Messiah. The subject soon was dropped.

耶稣刚进入圣殿就被宗教的领袖们团团围住了。耶稣是凭着什么权柄作为弥赛亚骑驴进入耶路撒冷，洁净圣殿并在那里教导众人呢？这些就是他们的疑问，但是他们的目的是要判他死罪。作为回答，耶稣反问他们，是谁差派施洗约翰完成使命的。作为上帝的先知，约翰已经宣称耶稣是弥赛亚。这个话题很快不了了之了。

#### Parables of Judgment （Matt. 21:28-22:14; Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19） 审判的比喻（马太福音21:28-22:14;马可福音12:1-12;路加福音20:9-19）


The religious leaders of the Jews clearly had not believed the words of John. They did not accept Jesus as the promised Savior. As a final judgment on their unbelief, Jesus spoke three parables.

犹太的宗教领袖们明显不相信约翰所说的话。他们也不接受耶稣就是那位应许的救主。耶稣说了三个比喻，作为对他们不信最终的审判。

The Parable of the Two Sons showed the leaders' to be insincere. Many people who were known for leading sinful lives （tax collectors and prostitutes） came to believe in Jesus, repented and did the will of God the Father. But the Scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees who seemed so religious continued to reject the Savior

两个儿子的比喻表明这些领袖们是虚伪的。很多被公认为活在罪恶中的人来到耶稣这里相信他，悔改，并且按天父上帝的旨意行事。但是文士、法利赛人和撒都该人，这些看上去很虔诚的人们，却不断地拒绝这位救主。

The Parable of the Wicked Tenants was spoken to show how rebellious the Jews were and how this would soon result in the death of God's Son. Who do the people in the parable represent?:

邪恶租户的比喻是为了表明犹太人是如何地悖逆，以及这样的悖逆将会如何迅速地导致上帝儿子的死亡。比喻中的每个人都代表什么呢？

the landowner = God the Father

the vineyard = God's rule of Israel in Old Testament times

the tenants = Rulers, teachers, leaders

the servants = Old Testament prophets, John the Baptist

the son = Jesus Christ, Son of God

家主=天父上帝

葡萄园=在旧约时期上帝治理以色利的法则

租户们=官长、教师、领袖们

仆人们=旧约的先知们，施洗约翰

儿子=耶稣基督，上帝的儿子

Furthermore, Jesus noted that since the Jews had rejected him, Christianity now would be offered to Gentiles. “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” （Mark 12:10）。 And this is just what happened.

此外，耶稣还提到既然犹太人拒绝他，如今福音将会被传给外邦人。“匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。（马可福音12:10）”.并且这正是所发生的一切。

One final time, in The Parable of the Wedding Feast Jesus warned the Jewish leaders to turn from their evil ways so that judgment would not come upon them. The Lord also repeated that the Gospel, rejected by the Jews, would be offered to Gentiles.

最后，在婚礼筵席的比喻中，耶稣警告犹太领袖们转离罪恶的道路，以至于审判可以不临到他们。主也再次表明，犹太人所拒绝的福音，将要被赐给外邦人。

#### Exchange of Questions and Answers （Matt. 22:15-46; Mark 12:13-37; Luke 20:20-44） 问与答（马太福音22:15-46;马可福音12:13-37;路加福音20:20-44）

The Jewish leaders did not arrest and kill Jesus immediately because they feared the people. Only two days earlier a crowd had greeted Jesus as their king. Thus the leaders decided to try to catch Jesus in a mistake. So they began to ask him tricky questions.

因为他们害怕群众，犹太的领袖们没有立即逮捕和杀害耶稣。仅仅两天前，一大群人去迎候他们的君王耶稣。因此这些领袖们决定找到耶稣的把柄。于是他们开始向耶稣问一些刁钻的问题。

The first question had to do with taxes. They asked “Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” （Matt. 22:17）。 If Jesus answered “yes,” the Jewish people would have become angry, at least the ones who believed that God, not the emperor, was their real ruler. On the other hand, a “no” answer would have made him a traitor to Rome and guilty of treason.

第一个问题与税收有关。他们问到：“纳税给凯撒可以不可以？（马太福音22:17）”.如果耶稣回答“可以”,犹太人将会怒不可遏，至少那些相信上帝是他们真正元首——而不是罗马皇帝——的犹太人更会如此。另外，若回答“不可以”,将会让他成为罗马帝国的叛徒，被判以叛国罪。

Jesus' response covers the whole subject in a single sentence. “Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's” （Matt. 22:21）。 There is an earthly kingdom and a spiritual kingdom. The duties which people have toward both must be kept separated and should not be in conflict.

耶稣一句简单的回答涵盖了整个问题。“凯撒的物当归给凯撒，神的物当归给神。（马太福音22:21）”.既有地上的国度，也有属灵的国度。人们必须分清在这两个国度所具有的责任，并且不应相互混淆。

The Pharisees and Herodians had failed. So the Sadducees took their turn at trying to trap Jesus. Although they did not believe in the resurrection of the body, they still asked the Lord about the afterlife. His answer was that the human and family relationships of this world will not be part of the next life.

法利赛人和希律党失败了。于是轮到了撒都该人尝试陷害耶稣。虽然他们不相信身体的复活，他们还是向主询问关于来生的事情。耶稣回答是：此生的人类和家庭的关系，不会被带到来世。

The Sadducees seems to have accepted the first five books of the Bible. They had quoted words from Deuteronomy （25:5-6） to try to trap Jesus. Now he answered by quoting from Exodus （3:6）， “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham . . . Isaac . . . Jacob.” God did not say “I used to be the God” but “I am the God” of the Jews who had died centuries earlier. How could the relationship between God and believers continue if there was no life after death? The Sadducees were silenced.

撒都该人看起来是接受圣经前五卷书的。他们引用了申命记的经文企图陷害耶稣。现在耶稣引用了出埃及记的经文来回答他们：“我是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。”上帝没有说“我曾是谁的神”,而是说“我是”那些数个世纪之前已经死去的犹太人的神。如果死后再没有生命，上帝和信徒之间的关系如何能够继续呢？撒都该人无法作答。

With the Sadducees defeated, the Pharisees tried one last time to trap Jesus. For us to understand the question they asked, we must remember that the Pharisees put all their faith in obeying religious laws, some given by God, others invented by humans. They now asked Jesus, “which of these laws is the most important and which is the least important?”

撒都该人失败后，法利赛人尝试着最后一次陷害耶稣。为了能让我们理解他们所问的问题，我们需要知道法利赛人将他们全部的信心倾注在遵守宗教律法之上，其中的一些律法是上帝颁布的，另外那些则是由人添加的。现在，他们问耶稣：“律法上的诫命，哪一条是最大的呢？哪一条又是最小的呢？”

Christ answered by explaining that all God's Law was important and that the Commandments could be summarized in one word – love. The Pharisees who asked the question could only agree.

基督解释说，所有上帝的律法都是重要的，并且所有的诫命可以归结为一个字：爱；这就是耶稣的回答。提出问题的那个法利赛人只能赞同。

The Jewish leaders had tried to trap Jesus, but failed. Now for one last time, Jesus tried to reason with them. He asked a question of his own, not to trap them but rather to free them from their blindness. The question concerned David's Son and David's Lord. They were expecting a Messiah who would be like David （a man and a king）。 However, the Old Testament （Ps. 110） also referred to the Messiah as “Lord” （almighty God）。 Jesus was presenting himself to the Jews as the true Messiah – true Man and true God. Such a teaching got the attention of the people but was hated by the Jewish leaders.

犹太领袖门尝试抓住耶稣的把柄，但是都失败了。现在，耶稣最后一次试图劝化他们。他自己问了一个问题，不是为了试探他们，而是想将他们从捆绑中释放出来。这是一个关于“大卫的子孙”和“大卫的主”的问题。他们期待着一位像大卫（一个人以及一个国王）一样的弥赛亚。然而，旧约圣经（诗篇110）在提到弥赛亚时称之为主（全能的上帝）。耶稣作为真正的弥赛亚向犹太人显现他自己——真人和真神。这样的教导吸引了人们的注意，但是却使犹太人的领袖们怀恨在心。

#### Christ Speaks Against the Pharisees and Scribes （Matt. 23:1-39; Mark 12:38-40; Luke 20:45-47） 基督指责法利赛人和文士（马太福音23:1-39;马可福音12:38-40;路加福音20:45-47）

The Pharisees and Scribes were to “sit in Moses' seat” （Matt. 23:2）， in other words, to teach the people the Scriptures. The disciples and people were told to listen to the Bible teachings. But the religious leaders refused to practice what they preached.

法利赛人和文士都“坐在摩西的位上”（马太福音23:2），换句话说就是，他们教导人们圣经上的话。门徒们和百姓被告知要听从圣经的教导。但是宗教的领袖们却拒绝将他们所传讲的付诸实践。

They did all they could to bring themselves a good reputation, never stopping to give glory to God; they showed off before the people; they insisted on being called “rabbi” （my teacher）。 They had no humility in their lives.

他们竭尽所能为自己赢得好的名声，却未曾停下来将荣耀归给神；他们在人前炫耀；他们坚持被人称呼“拉比”（我的老师）。他们的生命必须谦卑下来。

In one of his longer speeches Jesus attacked their hypocrisy. Several times he repeated the word “woe,” meaning “damnation is coming to you.” In Matthew's account Christ spoke against the Scribes and Pharisees:

作为他最长的教导之一，耶稣抨击了他们的伪善之处。他一连几次地重复的这个词“祸”,意思是“诅咒要临到你们”.在马太福音的记载中，基督如此指责文士和法利赛人：

1. Because the false doctrine they taught led people away from salvation.

    因为教导错误的教义，他们带领人们远离了救恩。

2. Because they sought followers and made them hypocrites worse than they themselves.

    因为他们广收门徒，使这些门徒比他们自己更加伪善。

3. Because they did not keep their oaths to God and made others keep their earthly oaths.

    因为他们没有遵守对上帝的誓言，并且使其他人遵守他们属世的誓言。

4. Because they did not understand the most important points of the Law.

    因为他们没有明白律法中最重要的观点。

5. Because they insisted on being clean on the outside but didn't care about inner （moral, spiritual） purity.

    因为他们坚持外表保持清洁，却不关心内心（道德，属灵）的洁净。

6. Because they pretended to be pure but were evil inside.

    因为他们假装纯洁，内心却充满诡诈。

7. Because they honored the dead prophets but at the same time were planning Jesus' death.

    因为他们尊敬死去的先知，同时却在计划着杀害耶稣。

#### The Widow's Mite （Mark 12:41-44; Luke 21:1-4） 寡妇的小钱（马可福音12:41-44;路加福音21:1-4）

Jesus had been in the temple for several hours that Tuesday morning. He had been opposed by the very people who should have fallen to their knees and worshiped him. Were there any faithful Israelites left in Jerusalem?

星期二的上午，耶稣在圣殿中待了几个小时。他在那里遭到一些人的敌对，那些本该向他屈膝敬拜之人的敌对。耶路撒冷城还有信实的以色列人吗？

As Jesus looked around he saw a widow drop two small coins in the temple offering box. There were still some true Israelites. This woman trusted in God's care and answered with her love. Here was a believer who owned nothing, yet, at the same time, had the greatest treasure – salvation.

当耶稣举目四顾时，他看到一个寡妇向圣殿的奉献箱中投入了两个小钱。这个妇人相信上帝的照料，并用她的爱来回应。一个信徒纵然一无所有，然而与此同时，他拥有最伟大的财富——救恩。

#### Greeks Seek Jesus （John 12:20-36） 希腊人求见耶稣（约翰福音12:20-36）

While Jesus was looking at the widow the disciples reported that some Greeks wished to speak to him. The were starting to come to faith. These Gentiles had begun to realize Jesus was their Savior. 33 years earlier Simeon （see Chapter 1） had called Jesus “a light for revelation to the Gentiles” （Luke 2:32）， and now that prophecy was being fulfilled.

当耶稣还关注着寡妇的时候，门徒们报告说，一些希腊人希望能够跟耶稣交谈。他们刚拥有信心。这些外邦人已经开始意识到耶稣就是他们的救主。33年前西面曾称呼耶稣为“照亮外邦人的光”（路加福音2:32），现如今这个预言被印证了。

Jesus' spent most of his earthly ministry preaching to the Jews. After his resurrection, the Gentiles would hear of him. By that time Jesus would be exalted in his full glory.

在他公开服事时，耶稣花了大部分的时间向犹太人传道。他复活以后，外邦人将会知道他。到那时耶稣将在他丰满的荣耀中被接高升。

#### Concluding Remarks （John 12:36-50） 结语（约翰福音12:36-50）

When Jesus entered the temple that Tuesday morning his authority immediately was challenged. As he left the temple that forenoon, he again told where he got his authority. He and the Father are One.

当耶稣在星期二的早晨步入圣殿时，人们即刻挑战了他的权柄。当他在中午之前离开圣殿时，他再次生命他的权柄是从何而来的。他和天父本为一。
