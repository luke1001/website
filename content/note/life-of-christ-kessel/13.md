#### Introduction  简介

The Apostles' Creed contains a short summary of Jesus' life. For 33 years he lived in a “state of humiliation.” That is to say, Jesus did not always use his divine rights or powers. For example, in the creed we confess to believe in Jesus, “Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.” Yet Jesus is God, and because he is God he is eternal and almighty. How then could he be born, suffer, and even die? The answer is found in St. Paul's letter to the Philippians （2:6-8）： Jesus “humbled himself and became obedient to death – even death on a cross.” He did this to save sinful mankind. For the past dozen chapters we have been studying Jesus' humility. In this chapter, however, we see the God-Man in his “state of exaltation” in which he makes full and complete use of his divine rights and powers. The Apostles' Creed describes this in the words “He descended into hell. The third day he arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty. From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.”

使徒信经中包含有耶稣一生的剪影。在33年的人生中，他始终处于“卑微的状态”之中。也就是说，耶稣不总是显现他的神性和能力。比如，在信经中我们宣告相信耶稣，那个“因圣灵感孕，由童贞女马利亚所生，在本丢彼拉多手下受难，被钉于十字架，受死，埋葬。”但是耶稣是上帝，并且因为这一点，他也是永恒和全能的。那他如何出生，受苦，甚至死亡呢？答案可以在圣保罗书信的腓立比书（2:6-8）中找到：耶稣“就自己卑微，存心顺服，以致于死，且死在十字架上。”他通过这一切来拯救罪恶的人类。因为在前面的十二章中，我们已经学习了耶稣的降卑。因此在本章中，我们将要在“高升的状态”中看这位神人；在这个状态中，他毫无保留地使用了他的神圣权柄和能力。使徒信经描述这一点时是这样表述的：（耶稣）降在阴间。第三天从死人中复活。升天，坐在全能父上帝的右边。将来必从那里降临，审判活人、死人。

#### Holy Saturday （Matt. 27:62-66, Luke 23:56） 神圣的星期六（马太福音27:62-66,路加福音23:56）

During the Sabbath （sunset Friday to sunset Saturday） the mourning women who had spent Good Friday watching Jesus die were now at home. They knew that Joseph and Nicodemus had prepared Jesus for burial, but they wanted to pay their last respects as well. However, they did not go to the tomb on the Old Testament holy day, but waited for Sunday.

在安息日（从星期五的日落到星期六的日落），那些“在受难日”见证了耶稣死亡的妇女们如今都待在家中。她们知道约瑟和尼哥德慕已经在操办耶稣的安葬，但是她们同样想在最后的时候，表示对耶稣的敬意。不过，她们还是没有在安息日去坟墓那里，而是等待星期天的到来。

While the women kept the Sabbath, the chief priests and Pharisees broke the rules of the day. They entered the house of a Gentile, Pontius Pilate, and asked for a favor. Since they were afraid that the disciples might steal Jesus' body, they asked Pilate to put a guard at the tomb. Pilate agreed.

当这些妇女们守着安息日的同时，大祭司和法利赛人却违背着这一天的律法。他们进入了一个外邦人本丢彼拉多的家中，并且期望他帮个小忙。因为他们担心耶稣的门徒们会去偷他的尸体，他们请求彼拉多派人把守坟墓。这个请求被应允了。

While this was going on, the Lord Jesus' spirit was alive. He told the thief on the cross that that very day he would be with him in paradise. With his last breath Jesus gave his spirit into his Father's hands.

这些事发生时，耶稣的灵在天堂中。他曾告诉同在十字架上的那个贼，今日他要与耶稣同在乐园里了。在耶稣断气的时候，他将自己的灵魂交在了天父的手中。

#### Easter Sunday  复活主日

The Women Visit the Tomb on Easter （Matt. 28:1-7; Mark 16:2-8; Luke 24:1-8; John 20:1-2） At sundown on Saturday the Sabbath was over. Since it was dark the women still could not visit the tomb. So they passed another grief-filled night. Jesus, however, rose from the dead and descended into hell. He did not go there to suffer, however but to proclaim victory over the devil and those belonging to him （1 Pet. 3:18-18; Col. 2:15）。

在复活主日，妇女们来到了坟墓前（马太福音28:1-7;马可福音16:2-8;路加福音24:1-8;约翰福音20:1-2）。安息日在星期六日落时即结束了。因为天黑的缘故，妇女们无法去坟墓那里。因此他们经历了有一个悲伤的夜晚。然而，耶稣死里复活并降在阴间。他去地狱并不是去受苦，而是向魔鬼和属于他的一切宣告耶稣的得胜。

Sunday morning, April 9, the women rose at dawn, dressed, gathered their burial spices and set out on the lonely walk to the tomb. One woman, Mary Magdalene, had set out even earlier. As she walked, sad thoughts must have crossed her mind. Jesus, who had cast seven demons out of her and had saved her, was now dead. As she came to the tomb the dim light of dawn showed that the stone which had sealed the tomb had been rolled away. “Now,” she must have thought to herself, “they have even taken his dead body.” Without stopping to look further she ran to tell Peter and John the terrible news.

4月9日，星期天的凌晨，妇女们早早地起床，拿着她们用于安葬的香膏，形单影只地出发前往坟墓。其中的一个妇女，抹大拉的马利亚出发的还要更早些。路上，她的脑海里满是悲伤地念头。耶稣，曾从他的身体中赶走七个鬼并救了她一命的主，如今已经死了。当她来到坟墓前面的时候，藉着黎明微弱的亮光，她发现那块用来封闭坟墓的石头已经移开。“现在”,她一定想着：“他们甚至拿走了他的尸体。”来不及进一步查看，她跑着将这个噩耗告诉了彼得和约翰。

Meanwhile the other women arrived at the tomb. They included Mary （mother of the disciple James the Less）， Salome （mother of Jesus' cousins and the disciples James and John） and Joanna （who along with the others had supported Jesus ministry, Luke 8:2-3）。 Unlike Mary Magdalene, they not only came to the tomb, but even went in. There, two angels greeted them with the happiest sermon ever preached – “He has risen!” The heavenly messengers reminded the women of Christ's prophecies about his resurrection. And it was this Gospel message which filled their hearts with the certainty that he was alive. The women no longer cared about the tomb since it was empty. So the joyful women ran to tell the disciples the Good News.

期间，另外几个妇女来到了坟墓前。其中包括马利亚（雅各的妈妈），撒罗米（耶稣表兄弟，门徒雅各和约翰的妈妈），约亚拿（与其他人一起只吃过耶稣宣教的妇女，路加福音8:2-3）。和抹大拉的马利亚不同，她们没有停留在坟墓前，而是走了进去。在那里，两个天使问候了她们，并说出了有史以来最美好的宣告——“他复活了”.天上的使者提醒这些妇女们，使她们回忆起基督自己关于复活的预言。并且正是这个好消息，让她们满心相信，耶稣活着。因为坟墓早已空了，妇女们没有更多的逗留。于是，这些喜乐的妇女们跑着去将这个好消息告诉给其他的门徒们。

#### Peter and John Visit the Tomb （Luke 24:12; John 20:3-10） 彼得和约翰来到坟墓前（路加福音24:12;约翰福音20:3-10）


By the time the women had left the tomb, Mary Magdalene had told her sad news to Peter and John. Youthful John outran the older disciple to the tomb, but then he hesitated. Peter caught up and entered the tomb first.

妇女们离开坟墓后，抹大拉的马利亚已经将她所看到的坏消息告诉了彼得和约翰。年轻的约翰跑在前面，在年纪稍大的使徒前赶到了坟墓，但是当他到了那里，他犹豫没有进去。彼得赶到后，先进入了坟墓。

What impressed the two disciples most was the condition of the burial cloth. If thieves had stolen his body, the burial linens would also have been missing. On the other hand if Jesus had awakened out of a coma the wrap would have been unrolled and scattered across the tomb floor. But in fact, the cloth lay folded in place. It was as if in a miraculous way, Christ had risen right out of the cloth.

安葬耶稣的裹头巾和细麻布使这两个使徒印象深刻。如果贼偷走了尸体，这些安葬用的细麻布一定也会丢了。另外，如果耶稣只是从昏迷中苏醒，这些缠裹的布将被解开，然后被散乱地扔在墓穴的地上。但是事实是，裹头巾在一边卷着。这是不可思议的，耶稣已从裹头巾里复活而出。

#### Jesus Appears to the Women （Matt. 28:8-10; Mark 16:9-11; Luke 24:9-11; John 20:11-18） 耶稣向妇女们显现（马太福音28:8-10;马克福音16:9-11;路加福音24:9-11;约翰福音20:11-18）

One cannot read the Easter story up to this point without feeling some pity for Mary Magdalene. Her grief at Jesus' death was huge. Yet her love for him moved her to awaken earlier than the rest on Easter Sunday. Her sorrow convinced her that thieves had taken his dead body. However, God had a special event awaiting her. Mary Magdalene was to be the first to see the risen Lord Jesus Christ.

读此故事的人读到这里，很难不怜悯抹大拉的马利亚。她因为耶稣的死极为悲痛。她对耶稣的爱使她在这个复活主日的早晨比其他人更早地醒来，悲伤的她认为耶稣的尸体被偷走了。然而，上帝为她预备了特别的礼物。主耶稣基督从死里复活后，抹大拉的马利亚成为第一个见到他的人。

By the time she walked back to the tomb, Peter and John had left. She did not recognize the angels, and at first even Jesus himself. But then the Lord called her by name. At last her heart was filled with the greatest joy. She must have decided to remain by his side forever. Jesus, however, had other plans. Mary was directed to tell the disciples the Good News about the risen Lord.

抹大拉的马利亚回到坟墓后，彼得和约翰已经离开。她没有认出天使们，甚至没有一下子认出耶稣自己。但是随后耶稣叫她的名字。她的心随即被极大地欢喜充满。她一定期望能够永远留在耶稣的身边。然而，耶稣有他自己的计划。抹大拉的马利亚受命将这个主复活的好消息告诉给所有的门徒们。

Shortly afterwards Jesus showed himself to the other women who were on their way to the disciples. They too were sent out to tell the Good News.

这之后不久，当其他妇女们在去见门徒们的路上时，耶稣向她们显现了自己。她们随即也被差派去传讲这个大好的消息。

#### The Tomb Guards Ordered to Lie （Matt. 28:11-15） 坟墓的守卫被要求撒谎（马太福音28:11-15）

33 years earlier Satan had tried to kill Jesus in Bethlehem before the Lord could earn salvation for mankind. But Satan failed. Then, on various occasions the Devil tried to tempt Jesus into sinning which would have ruined God's plan of redemption. Again he failed. Now, knowing that his evil cause was lost, Satan tried to hide the proof of the atonement – Christ's resurrection. When the guards who had been posted at the tomb reported what had happened, the Jews bribed them with money to say that Jesus' body had been stolen.

33年前，撒旦就曾尝试要在伯利恒杀死耶稣，阻止他为全人类赢得救赎。但是撒旦失败了。随后，魔鬼尝试了很多不同的方式去诱惑耶稣犯罪，以至于神的救赎计划因此落空。他同样失败了。现在当知道他恶毒的目标功亏一篑后，撒旦尝试着隐藏起救恩的证据——基督的复活。当被安排在坟墓边的守卫报告了所发生的一切时，犹太人贿赂他们，让他们撒谎说耶稣的身体被偷了。

Since there are many today who believe in a living Jesus, it is clear that not all have accepted this lie. Once again the devil failed in his wicked purpose.

因为今天有许多人相信这位活着的耶稣，和明显并不是所有人接受了这个谎言。撒旦的邪恶企图上又失败了。

#### Jesus Appears to Peter （Luke 24:34） 耶稣向彼得显现（路加福音24:34）

The Easter sun was rising high over Jerusalem. Jesus had appeared to the four faithful women. Before noon he was to show himself to one man. Just as Jesus had pity on Mary Magdalene, he had pity on Peter. Three times Peter had denied Jesus. Now the disciple heard that Jesus was alive. He had looked for himself at the burial linens. He must have wondered if the risen Jesus would ever forgive him and speak to him again. Jesus helped his troubled soul by appearing to him even before the other disciples （1 Cor. 15:5）。

在耶路撒冷，复活主日的太阳慢慢地升高。耶稣已经向四个忠实的妇女显现了。在中午之前他还要向一个人显现他自己。就像是耶稣怜恤抹大拉的马利亚一样，他也惦念着彼得。彼得三次不认主。现在，这个门徒听说耶稣还活着。他自己已经在安葬用的细麻布上看到了希望。他一定想知道复活的耶稣是否会原谅他并再次对他说话。在其他的门徒之前耶稣首先向彼得显现，抚平了他不安的心。

#### Jesus Appears on the Emmaus Road （Mark 16:12-I3; Luke 24:13-35） 耶稣在通往以马忤斯的路上显现（马可福音16:1-13;路加福音24:13-35）

It was Easter afternoon. Two believers were returning home from Jerusalem. As they walked their minds were troubled. A stranger approached and asked them why they were so bothered.

在复活主日的下午，两个信徒正从耶路撒冷返回自己的家中。他们困惑地走着，一个陌生人和他们同行，并询问他们为什么事情而烦恼。

Instead of showing himself to their eyes, Jesus turned them to the Scriptures and convinced them of the resurrection. Even after they recognized him, it was the Gospel message which formed the basis of their faith. “They asked each other, 'Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”‘ （Luke 24:32）。 After Jesus disappeared, the men hurried back to Jerusalem to tell the disciples.

耶稣并没有让他们认出自己，而是借助于圣经，使他们确信耶稣已经复活。甚至当他们认出他后，仍旧是福音的信息建立了他们信心的根基。“他们彼此说：’在路上，他和我们说话，给我们讲解圣经的时候，我们的心岂不是火热的吗？”（路加福音24:32）。耶稣小时候，这两个人立时起身返回耶路撒冷，要将刚发生的一切告诉其他的门徒们。

As an unknown Christian poet wrote:

一个不为人知的基督徒使人曾写道：

Life is like the Emmaus road

生命就像以马忤斯之路

We travel not alone,

我们不是形单影只的旅者

Beside us walks our risen Lord

复活的主与我们同行

To guide and keep his own.

为要引领、保守那归属于他的

#### Jesus Appears to Ten Disciples （Mark 16:14; Luke 24:36-43; John 20:19-23） 耶稣向十个门徒显现（马可福音16:14;路加福音24:36-43;约翰福音20:19-23）

The greatest day in earth's history was drawing to a close. Before the day ended, however, Jesus came to his disciples. Most of the disciples were confused by the reports they had heard. Suddenly Jesus stood in their midst. When they looked at their Savior and friend they thought he was a ghost. Jesus corrected this false idea by showing them his flesh and eating some food.

有史以来最伟大的一天接近尾声。然而，在此之前耶稣来到他门徒的面前。门徒中大部分人正为他们所听到的所困扰。突然耶稣站在了他们中间。当看到他们的救主、挚友，他们以为他是个鬼魂。为了纠正他们错误的念头，耶稣让他们看自己的身体，还吃了一些食物。

How can the disciples' first doubts be explained? The evil Jewish leaders had remembered Jesus' prophecy that he would rise on the third day （Matt. 27:63）。 The women believed the angels' report that “he is risen!” The Emmaus disciples believed the Old Testament's prophecies about the resurrection. Why, then, was it so hard for them to believe what they had heard and seen? Perhaps they were still afraid of the Jews or afraid of Jesus （after having abandoned him in Gethsemane）？ Whatever the reason, Jesus calmed their troubled hearts by twice repeating, “Peace be with you!”

如何解释门徒们最初的疑惑呢？邪恶的犹太领袖记得耶稣曾预言说，他要在第三天复活（马太福音27:63）。妇女们相信天使们宣告的“他已经复活了！”.以马忤斯门徒们相信旧约关于复活的预言。那么，让他们相信所见所闻为什么就那么难呢？也许他们仍旧害怕犹太人，或害怕耶稣（当他们在客西马尼园离弃了耶稣之后）？无论哪一个原因，耶稣抚平了他们心中的不安，两次对他们说：“愿你们平安！”

The disciples had sinned against Christ, but the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus brought them peace – the forgiveness of sins. Soon they would go looking for other sinners and proclaim to them the Gospel of peace.

门徒们得罪了基督，但是耶稣的受死与复活带给他们平安——罪得赦免。不久之后，他们就要启程寻找其他的罪人们，并且向他们宣告这赐下平安的福音。

#### Jesus Appears to all Eleven Disciples （John 20:24-29）  耶稣向所有十一个门徒显现（约翰福音20:24-29）

When Jesus first appeared to the disciples, Thomas was not there. Like the others, he refused to believe in the resurrection without more proof. A week later Thomas had his stubborn soul satisfied. The Lord appeared and invited him to touch his holy hands and side. Thomas answered, “My Lord and my God.” The word “my” was important. Faith is a personal acceptance of the living Lord and God. Jesus was pleased with Thomas' faith, but not with the demands he made before he would believe. Jesus answered, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” （John 20:29）。

当耶稣第一次向门徒们显现时，多马没有在场。像其他人一样，在没有更多证据的情况下，他拒绝相信主的复活。一周之后，多马这颗多疑的心终于满足了。主向他显现，并请他摸主的手，探入主的肋旁。多马回应说：“我的主，我的神！”这个“我”字非常的重要。信心是个人对永活的主和上帝的接纳。耶稣对多马的信心感到满意，但是对他信之前的要求感到不满。耶稣回答说：“你因看见了我才信，那没有看见就信的有福了！（约翰福音20:29）”

#### Jesus Appears in Galilee （John 21: 1-23） 耶稣在加利利显现（约翰福音21:1-23）

Jesus told the women on Easter Sunday “Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me” （Matt. 28:10）。 After seeing Jesus in Jerusalem the disciples left for Galilee, where some of them went back to fishing.

在复活主日，耶稣告诉妇女们“你们去告诉我的弟兄，叫他们往加利利去，在那里必见我。（马太福音28:10）”在耶路撒冷见到耶稣后，门徒们起身前往加利利，他们中的一些人回到那里后又去打渔了。

Jesus came to these disciples and worked a miracle by supplying a large net of fish. Peter was full of joy to see the Lord, but the Lord still had not had a chance to talk to Peter about his sin, the three times he denied Jesus. Now, the time was right. Three times Jesus asked Peter if he loved him. In each case he answered that he did. Jesus gave Peter a new call to be an apostle. He now told Peter to go to the young （lambs） and old （sheep） and feed them the Gospel. The Lord also showed Peter that he would not deny him again. Rather than do that he would go to his own death. Indeed Peter was crucified for his faith about 33 years later. Meanwhile, Peter's friend, the Apostle John, outlived the other disciples and died of old age about A.D. 98.

耶稣找到这些门徒并成就了一个神迹，使他们网到极多的鱼。再次见到主，彼得非常兴奋。现在是时候了。耶稣三次问彼得是否爱他。每一次彼得都回答：爱。耶稣给了使徒彼得一个新的呼召。他如今告诉彼得：到那些小羊（羔羊）和羊（绵羊）那里，并用福音喂养它们。主也告诉彼得，他不会再不认自己的主了。他宁可去死也不会再做这样的事了。确实，在33年后彼得为他的信仰死在十字架上。与此同时，彼得的朋友——使徒约翰——相比其他的门徒活得更久，并在公元98年左右终老。

#### The Great Commission （Matt. 28:16-20; Mark 16:15-18） 大使命（马太福音28:16-20;马可福音16:15-18）

Some time later Christ appeared on a mountain. A crowd of over 500, including the disciples, had gathered （I Cor. 15:6）。 The words Jesus spoke have come to be known as The Great Commission. He said, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” （Matt. 28:19-20）。

一段时间之后，基督在一座山上显现。有超过500人聚集在那里，门徒们也在其中（哥林多前书15:6）。期间，耶稣所说的话后来被称作“大使命”.他说：“你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗，反我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守。（马太福音28:19-20）”

In the space of about a month Jesus had given the believers three great tools of faith: the Gospel, the Lord's Supper and Holy Baptism. These were the “Means of Grace,” the means by which God gives men the forgiveness earned by Jesus on the cross. Indeed, only through these three means can anyone come to faith and then remain strong until the end.

在差不多一个月的时间里，耶稣给了门徒们三个伟大的信心法宝：福音，圣餐礼和圣洗礼——也被称作“施恩具”.通过这样的施恩具，上帝将耶稣在十字架上所赢得的赦免赐给人们。确实，只有通过这三个途径，人们才能得到信心，并持守信心，至死不弃。

#### The Ascension （Mark 16:19-20; Luke 24:44-53）   高升（马可福音16:19-20;路加福音24:44-53）

The day was Thursday, May 18, A.D. 30. It was 40 days after Jesus' resurrection. In response to his command the disciples gathered on a hill near Jerusalem. St. Luke （Acts 1:6） reveals that they were still slow to understand the nature of Christ's Kingdom. From now on it would be up to the Holy Spirit to give them the Scriptural understanding they needed. Finally, Jesus once again told the believers to share the Gospel with the whole world. Then he ascended out of their sight. After 33 years on Earth, Jesus returned home, and he took up his position at the right hand of God the Father （Matt. 28:18）。

那一天是公元30年，5月18日，星期四。耶稣死而复活40天之后。他的门徒们遵循他的命令，聚集在耶路撒冷附近的一座山上。圣路加（使徒行传1:6）表明，门徒们对于领受什么是基督的国度，仍旧有些迟钝。从今以后，需要依靠圣灵赐给他们所需的属灵悟性。最后，耶稣再次告诉所有的信徒们，要向全世界分享福音。随即他从门徒的视野中消失，升天了。在世上生活了33年后，耶稣回到了他的家，并坐在了全能父上帝的右边（马太福音28:18）。

#### Conclusion to the Gospels （John 20:30-31; 21:24-25） 福音书的总结（约翰福音20:30-31;21:24-25）

The story of Jesus' life as told in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke is now complete. But John needed to add two last comments. “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” （John 20:31）。

马太、马可、路加福音所记载的耶稣生平到此结束了。但是约翰特别地加上了一点补充：“但记这些事，要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是神的儿子，并且叫你们信了他，就可以因他的名得生命。（约翰福音20:31）”
