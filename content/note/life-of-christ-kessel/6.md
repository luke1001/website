#### Introduction 概述

Jesus' great Galilean Ministry lasted from about January of A.D. 28 to early April of A.D. 29. Then it came to a sudden end. Beginning with the death of John the Baptist, Jesus wished to take a break from his public teaching so that he could teach his disciples in private. He was also beginning to prepare himself for the suffering and death that was getting ever nearer. In this chapter we begin with Jesus preaching on both sides of the Sea of Galilee. This was in the late fall of A.D. 28.

耶稣在大加利利地区的传道大约从公元28年1月持续到公元29年4月初。随后突然停止。施洗约翰死后，耶稣想要停止公开传道，休息一下，这样他好能够私下里单独教导他的门徒。他也好开始预备自己，为了那越来越近的受难和受死。在本章节中，我们先开始学习耶稣在加利利海两岸的传道。这些事件发生在公元28年晚秋时节。

#### Healing the Demon Possessed Men from Gadara （Matt. 8:28-34; Mark 5: 1-20; Luke 8: 26-39） 医治被鬼附的加大拉人（太8:28-34;可5:1-20;路8:26-39）

The morning following Jesus' busiest day the Lord Jesus and his disciples were still in their boat on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. As soon as they came to shore, Jesus was met by two men possessed by demons. The Gospels tell us especially about what happened to one of the men.

最忙碌的那天之后的早晨，主耶稣和门徒仍然停留在加利利海东岸的船上。他们一上岸，就有两个被鬼附的人来迎他。福音书中特别讲述了其中一个人身上发生的事。

Jesus spoke to the demons and threw them out of the man. The demons then entered a herd of pigs. These pigs then ran over a cliff into the sea. The man then began to witness to others about the power of God

耶稣对魔鬼说话并把他们从那人里赶出去。后来魔鬼进了一群猪里。这些猪闯下山崖掉进海里。随后这人就开始告诉别人上帝的大能。

#### Raising of Jairus' Daughter （Matt. 9:1,18-26; Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56） 使睚鲁的女儿复活（太9:18-26;可5:21-43;路8:40-56）

After healing the men from Gadara, Jesus and his followers returned across the Sea. There he was met by a happy crowd. One man in particular was not only glad but needed to see Jesus. Jairus, the head of a local synagogue, begged Jesus to come and save his dying 12 year old daughter.

治好从加大拉来的人之后，耶稣和门徒回来打算渡到海的对面去。在那边欢呼的人群迎接耶稣。有一个特别的人不仅仅是很高兴，而是有需要见耶稣。睚鲁，当地管理会堂的人，祈求耶稣来救他快要死的12岁的女儿。

While Jesus was going with Jairus a woman with a severe bleeding problem made her way through the crowd and touched his clothes. According to Old Testament Law （15:25-27） she was unclean and was not permitted to touch anyone. But she too was desperate. Jesus showed that he knew all things by recognizing her need. He then showed he was all powerful by healing her. But Jesus would soon show that he had even greater power!

在耶稣和睚鲁同去的时候，一位患有严重血漏的妇人从人群中挤过来，摸耶稣的衣服。根据旧约的律法（15:25-27），她不洁净而且不允许碰触别人。但她也是那么的急切。耶稣通过知晓她的需求来向众人显明他无所不知。然后耶稣又通过治愈患血漏的妇人彰显自己的全能。耶稣很快要显明他又更大的能力！

By this time Jairus' daughter had died. When Jesus reached his house a crowd of crying people had already gathered. Jesus cleared the room where the dead girl lay , keeping only Peter, James, and John with him. He then restored the girl to life.

这时睚鲁的女儿已经死了。当耶稣到达睚鲁家时，一大群哀哭的人已经聚集起来。耶稣让人们离开那死了的女儿躺卧的房间，只留下彼得、雅各和约翰同他一起。然后他使女儿复活了。

By raising this girl, and by raising a widow's son in the town of Nain （Luke 7:11-17）， Jesus shows us not only his loved for suffering people but his total power and authority as well. When the Prince of Life speaks, even the dead listen and obey. Therefore, death loses its sting for the Christian （1 Cor. 15:55-56）。 When we remember Jairus' daughter and the widow's son, several New Testament verses take on special meaning for us. For example St. Paul, speaking about Judgment Day, says “the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command . . . and the dead in Christ will rise first . . . And so we will be with the Lord forever” （1 Thess. 4:16-17）。 Interestingly, 1 Thess. 4:18 concludes, “Therefore encourage each other with these words.”

使睚鲁的女儿复活，还有在拿因城使寡妇的儿子复活（路7:11-17），耶稣借由这两个人的复活不仅向我们彰显他对受苦的人的爱，还显明了他的全能和权柄。当生命的王说话的时候，甚至是死的人也要听从和遵行。因此，对于基督徒来说死失去了它的毒钩（林前15:55-56）。当我们想起睚鲁的女儿和寡妇的儿子的时候，几节新约经文对于我们来说就有特别的意思了。举个例子来说，圣徒保罗讲到审判之日时，这样说：“主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音……那在基督里死了的人必先复活……这样，我们就要与主永远同在”（帖前4:16-17）。有趣的是，提前4:18结尾这样说：“所以你们当用这些话彼此劝慰。”

#### Blind Men and Dumb Spirit （Matt. 9:27-34） 瞎子和哑巴（太9:27-34）

As Jesus was leaving Jairus' home, he was asked to help other needy people. He healed two blind men so they could see again. He threw a demon out of a man so that he could speak again. The people were amazed. However, the Pharisees responded as usual: “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons” （Matt. 9:34）。

当耶稣离开睚鲁家时，被请求去帮助别的有需要的人。他治好了两个瞎子，他们就能再次看见了。他赶走了污鬼，那人就能说话了。人们都惊奇耶稣所做的。然而法利赛人的反应和往常一样：“他是靠着鬼王赶鬼”（太9:34）。

#### The Apostles Sent Forth （Matt. 9:35-11:1; Mark 6: 6-12; Luke 9:1-6） 差派使徒（太9:35-11:1;可6:6-12;路9:1-6）

It was probably during the early months of A.D. 29 that Jesus made his final preaching trip through Galilee. As he went from village to village preaching and healing, two terrible facts kept troubling his soul. First, the people were spiritually lost. Second, the Jewish religious leaders were not giving proper spiritual help and advice to the people.

大约在公元29年前面几个月期间，耶稣行遍加利利，进行最后的传道。耶稣在各乡之间传道、医治的同时，两件可怕的事实一直搅扰他的灵魂。第一，人们灵魂失丧。第二，犹太教领袖无法给出正确的圣灵的帮助和建议。

Jesus' love and concern now caused him to act. He called the disciples together and then sent them to preach to the people. However, before sending them out he gave them a set of guidelines to use throughout their ministries （Matt. 10:5-52）。 His instructions were as follows:

耶稣的爱和关注如促使他要行出来。他把门徒召集到一起，然后差派他们去传道。然而差派他们之前，耶稣给他们一套指南，这指南贯穿使徒的传道过程（太10:5-52）。他的指导如下：

1. The Target （vv 5-6）。 Jesus told the disciples to do the work for which he was calling them. At this time they were to preach only to Israelites. Later they would be sent to all men （Acts 1:8）。

    目的（5-6节）。耶稣告诉门徒呼召他们乃是为了做工。这时他们只向以色列人传道。以后他们将要被差派到全人类（徒1:8）。

2. The Tools （vv 7-10）。 The Gospel makes the ministry. The pastor's great tool is the message of God's love for his people. The miracles were only to be a witness to the preaching of the Word.

    工具（7-10节）。福音构成了传道。牧师最伟大的工具就是上帝爱世人的讯息。而神迹只是传扬神的道的见证。

3. The Method （vv 11-15）。 Armed with the Word, the disciples were to go in peace, wisdom, and innocence.

    方法（11-15节）。用神的道武装自己，门徒就会平和、智慧、驯良。

4. The Troubles （vv 16-25）。 The job was not going to be easy. The disciples were warned to be alert and morally blameless. When the forces of Satan worked against them, the Holy Spirit would be with the disciples and work through them. The message of Christ would sometimes divide families. Unbelievers would accuse the apostles of working with Satan's power, just as they had accused Christ of that.

    困境（16-25节）。为上帝工作并不是件容易的事。耶稣提醒门徒要时刻警醒，也要在在道德上清白。当撒旦的力量攻击他们时，圣灵会与门徒同在并胜过撒旦的权势。基督的使命有时会分离家庭。不信的人会指责门徒是靠着撒旦的力量做工，正如他们指责基督那样。

5. The Triumph （vv 26-40）。 To help them stand strong against the forces of evil the disciples were to remember that the Almighty God is all knowing, always present with his people, and always takes care of the people doing his work. Jesus himself would someday praise his faithful servants before his Father in heaven. Finally, through their preaching of the Gospel others would come to faith.

    称圣、典范（26-40节）。为了帮助使徒在魔鬼的势力前刚强壮胆，他们一定要记住万能的上帝无所不知，一直与他的子民同在，而且在意人们为他所作的工。耶稣自己在将来的某一天会在天堂他的父面前称赞他的信实的仆人。最终，通过他们传扬的福音，让其他人信上帝。

After Jesus had finished speaking to the disciples he sent them out in pairs. Perhaps they traveled and preached for as long as a month. We are not told. However, they came back filled with happiness at seeing how God had blessed the preaching of his Word.

耶稣与门徒讲完这些话就差派他们两两结伴去传福音。他们或许行走、讲道一个月的时间。关于这个时间圣经没有告诉我们。然而，他们返回时充满了幸福，因为他们看到了上帝是如何祝福传讲他的道的。

#### Death of John the Baptist （Matt. 14:6-12; Mark 6:21-29; Luke 9:7-9） 施洗约翰的死（太14:6-12;可6:21-29;路9:7-9）

Sometime during March of A.D. 29, while the disciples were still preaching among the people, news of a terrible murder reached Jesus. John the Baptist had been executed by Herod because he had preached against the king's adultery. Jesus must have been horrified by the ugly details of the story. But Jesus also was full of deep sorrow. The Forerunner's life and work had been ended. Jesus knew that soon he would lay down his life even for the likes of the sinners who had beheaded John （Mark 9:12-13）。

在公元29年3月的某一天，当使徒们仍然在人们中间传道的时候，一件可怕的谋杀的消息传到耶稣那里。施洗约翰已经被希律王处死，因为约翰说教反对希律的淫乱罪行。耶稣一定被这个故事的丑陋的细节所惊骇。但是耶稣也充满了深切的伤痛之感。这个为主预备道路的人的一生和工作已经结束。耶稣知道他很快也会放弃他的生命，甚至是为了那些已经砍了约翰的头的罪人。

#### Jesus' First Withdrawal 耶稣第一次“撤退”

Just as John's imprisonment marked the beginning of Jesus' Galilean ministry （see Chapter 3） now John's death marked its end. From this time on Jesus tried to stop his public ministry and teach the disciples in private. We call this his first withdrawal （drawing back from public ministry）。 This first effort to escape the crowds took him to the area near to Galilee.

正如约翰被关押标志着耶稣在加利利地区传道的开始（参看第三章），现在约翰的死标志着耶稣在加利利地区的传道结束了。从这时开始，耶稣试着停止公开传道和私下教导门徒。我们称此为耶稣的第一次退出（从公开传道中退出）。第一次努力避开会众，耶稣来到加利利附近的区域。

#### Jesus Attempts to Withdraw （Matt. 14:13-14; Mark 6:33; Luke 9:10-11a; John 6:1） 耶稣尝试远离人群（太14:13-14;可6:33;路9:10-11a;约6:1）

When the disciples returned from their preaching trip they were full of excitement. Jesus wanted to discuss what they had done and think over John's death. So he kept away from the crowd. Together with the disciples he left Capernaum and got on a boat which would take them six miles north to a more deserted area.

当门徒从他们的传道行程中回来时都很兴奋。耶稣想要讨论一下他们都做了什么，还有他们如何看待约翰的死。因此他远离人群。耶稣和门徒一起离开迦百农，上了一艘船，来到向北6里的多沙漠地带。

But the wind was blowing against them. At the same time the crowd on shore determined to see Jesus. They set out on foot toward Bethsaida Julia. Some men ran and were on hand to meet the ship when it put in to shore. They were joined by some of the people going to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover

他们逆着风航行。与此同时岸上的会众想要见耶稣。他们步行朝着伯赛大、犹利亚前进。有些男人跑起来期望在船靠岸时见到耶稣。有些去耶稣撒冷过逾越节的人也加入进来。

#### Feeding of the Five Thousand （Matt. 14:15-21; Mark 6:34-44; Luke 9:11-17; John 6:2-14） 喂饱五千人（太14:15-21;可6:34-44;路9:11-17;约6:2-14）

It was clear that Jesus could not be alone with the disciples. Once again, as he had done so often in the past, Jesus disregarded his own feelings. his love moved him to heal the sick. His love compelled him to preach the Kingdom of God to them.

很明显耶稣和门徒在一起并不寂寞。和往常一样，耶稣再次不顾自己的感觉，他的爱转到医治有病的人上面。他的爱促使他向他们传扬神的国度。

As evening approached, the people became hungry. Jesus' pity caused him to use his power again. He ordered the people to sit down in groups on the green grass of the hillside. Then he said a prayer over two small fish and five barley rolls. He then divided them into pieces and had his disciples hand them around to the people. In this simple way Christ performed a miracle of great power. 5000 men plus women and children ate their fill, and 12 baskets of pieces were leftover.

天将晚的时候，会众饿了。耶稣的怜悯让他再次使用大能。他吩咐众人有秩序地坐在山坡的草地上。然后他为两条小鱼和五个大麦饼祷告。耶稣把饼和鱼掰开，让门徒分发给众人。基督用这种简单的方式行出了最大的神迹。喂饱了包括男人、妇女和儿童在内共5000人，还剩了12筐的零碎。

#### Jesus Walks on Water （Matt. 14:22-36; Mark 6:45-56; John 6:15-21） 耶稣在水面上行走（太14:22-36;可6:45-56;约6:15-21）

Jesus' miracle fed the crowd with bread and fish, but this also gave the crowd some new ideas. They did not see Jesus as a savior from sin. Instead they saw him as a free doctor, a person who could give them food, and a king who would drive out the Romans. So now they were prepared to make Jesus their king by force, if that would be necessary （John 6:15）。

耶稣行神迹用饼和鱼喂饱了众人，但这也让他们有了新的想法。他们不把耶稣看做将他们从罪中拯救的救世主。而是把耶稣看做免费治病的医生，可以供给他们实物的人，以及能够逐出罗马人的王。因此，现在他们计划在有必要的情况下，就强制耶稣做他们的王（约6:15）。

Jesus knew their thoughts, and he wanted no part of their plans. Thus he sent away the disciples （who seemed to have been influenced by the crowd's ideas） and ordered them to take a boat to Capernaum. Soon it would be night, so he sent the people away and then went himself to a mountain to pray. Earlier （see Chapter 4） He had spent a night in prayer before selecting his disciples.

耶稣知道他们的想法，不想成为他们计划的一部分。因此他派出门徒（看上去已经收到会众想法的影响），让他们乘船到迦百农去。很快夜晚来临，他让人群散开，自己到山上祷告去了。之前，他在选门徒之前祷告了一整夜。

Now he prayed for strength to teach the people what his true purpose was. While Jesus prayed, the disciples rowed. About 3:00 in the morning he decided to help his followers. For eight hours they had been rowing against the wind and had rowed only two-thirds of a mile. Now Jesus showed his power over the laws of nature. He simply walked across the lake to the boat. At first the disciples thought that Jesus was a ghost. Then, just when he was ready to climb into the boat Peter jumped out and tried to walk on the water to meet Jesus.

现在他祷告神加给他力量，好让他教导人们晓得他来的真正目的。耶稣祷告的时候门徒把船从岸边撑开。大约凌晨三点时，耶稣决定帮助他的门徒。因为门徒已经逆着风航行了8个小时，却只行进了三分之二里的距离。现在耶稣要向自然规律彰显自己的大能了。他直接在水面上行走，走到船那里。开始是门徒以为耶稣是鬼魂。后来正当耶稣准备上船时，彼得跳出来，并试图在水面上走过来见耶稣。

Peter showed that he had the faith of a hero but also the faith of a coward. As long as he looked at Jesus and trusted his Word he made good progress. However, when he became concerned about the wind and waves Peter began to sink. In his great fear he cried out for help. Jesus reached out and saved him.

在这里彼得显现了他英雄的信心也显现了懦弱的信心。当他看着耶稣，信任耶稣所说的话时，他走在了水面上。然而当彼得开始关注风浪时，就开始下沉。因为极其惧怕，彼得大喊救命。耶稣伸出手救了他。

Once in the boat, Jesus made the water quiet, again showing his control over nature. This miracle washed the spiritual sleep from the disciples' eyes. Though they had not believed after the feeding of the 5000, they now boldly declared: “Truly you are the Son of God” （Matt. 14:33）。

一次在船上，耶稣平静了风浪，再一次显示他对自然的掌控。这个神迹洗清了门徒们灵里浑浊的双眼。虽然经历了喂饱5000人的神迹他们仍未相信，现在他们勇敢地宣告：“你真是神的儿子了。（马太福音14:33）”

#### Sermon on the Bread of Life （John 6:22-71） 关于生命之粮的信息（约翰福音6:22-71）

When the morning sun rose over Galilee the crowd began looking for Jesus. Unable to find him near Bethsaida Julia, they looked near Capernaum. In time they found him there in the synagogue.

当朝阳在加利利升起时，人群们开始寻找耶稣。在伯赛大附近没能找到他，他们又在迦百农附近寻找。最后他们在会堂中找到了他。

Knowing that the crowd was still looking for a king to give them earthly blessings and not for a spiritual Messiah, Jesus preached a most timely sermon. He did speak about bread. He said that in the Old Testament it was God, not Moses, who fed the people manna in the wilderness. In this way he had prolonged their earthly lives （Exod. 16:1-15）。 Now Jesus himself, sent from heaven, is the bread which gives eternal life. Those who would be saved must believe in him.

因为知道这群人仍旧在寻找一个能给他们属世祝福的王，而不是一个属灵的弥赛亚，耶稣讲了一篇极为及时的信息。他讲的是关于粮食。他说，在旧约中是上帝而不是摩西，在旷野中赐给人们玛娜。通过这种方式，上帝是他们得以在世生存（出埃及记16:1-15）。现在耶稣自己从天而降，成为赐下永生的粮食。那些要得救赎的人必须相信耶稣。

If one listens carefully to this sermon he will hear the great ideas of salvation: grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone. Yet the crowd did not like much of what Christ said. They were upset to learn that Jesus would not immediately take care of all their physical needs.

如果一个人认真地听了这次讲道，他会听到救恩最伟大的信息：唯独恩典，唯独信心，唯独基督。然而人们并不十分喜欢耶稣所说的话。因为知道耶稣不会马上照顾他们所有人身体上的需要，他们开始变得烦躁。

After this event Jesus lost much of his popularity. “From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him” （John 6:66）。 Seeing this, Jesus asked the twelve disciples if they too wanted to leave him. But Jesus' walk on the water and the sermon that followed had strengthened the faith in the disciples' hearts. It was Peter who now made a bold statement of faith, confessing that Jesus was God's Son and the only source of eternal life.

这事之后耶稣不再那么受欢迎了。“从此他门徒中多有退去的，不再和他同行。”（约翰福音6:66）。看到这些，耶稣就问十二个门徒，是否他们也想离开自己。但是耶稣行走在水面上和他随后的讲道使门徒心里的信更加坚定。还是彼得勇敢地宣告了他的信仰，承认耶稣是上帝的儿子，是唯一得永生的源头。

#### Arguments about Religious Laws （Matt. 15:1-20; Mark 7:1-23） 争论宗教律法（马太福音15:1-20;马可福音7:1-23）

Jesus' popularity continued to be a concern for the Jewish rulers in distant Jerusalem. So the Sanhedrin, whose job it was to check the teachings of all preachers, sent men north to check on Jesus. These men accused Jesus' disciples of doing wrong.

耶稣的受欢迎程度仍旧是远在耶路撒冷的犹太官长们担忧的事情。所以作为监督教师们教导的犹太公会，差派人到北边查看耶稣。这些人指控耶稣的门徒们做错了事情。

Religious Jews always washed their hands before eating. Some Pharisees even went so far as to suggest that not washing hands before eating was as serious a sin as adultery. The disciples did not wash nor did the multitude at the feeding of the 5000.

犹太教徒总是要在饭前洗他们的手。一些法利赛人过于偏激，甚至建议将饭前不洗手与淫乱罪相提并论。门徒们就没有洗手，那吃饱的5000人群同样没有洗。

The Lord Jesus saw that the problem was not really hand washing. It was the difference between man-made laws and God's Law. The Scribes and Pharisees considered man-made laws to be of equal importance with God's Law. Jesus pointed out that they even used these laws to in ways that went against the Ten Commandments.

主耶稣看到真正的问题并不完全是洗不洗手。这是人的律法和上帝律法的区别。文士和法利赛人将人制定的律法和上帝的律法放在同样重要的位置。耶稣指出他们如此地使用律法，甚至已经违反了十条诫命。

By this time a crowd had gathered hoping to hear an argument. Jesus explained that obeying God's Law begins in the heart and is not a matter of just doing outward deeds.

这时，已经聚集了很多想要看热闹的人。耶稣解释说，遵守上帝的律法是从心里开始的，而不只是做表面的工夫。 　　　 

The disciples, however, were upset that the powerful Pharisees were offended. Jesus explained that his Father would take care of these false teachers later. In the mean time Jesus repeated that an unclean heart, not dirty hands, make a man a sinner.

然而，门徒们因为强势的法利赛人被冒犯而感到不安。耶稣的回答是，天父稍后会处理那些错误的教师们。同时，耶稣再次提到，不是肮脏的手，而是不洁净的心让一个人变成罪人。
