#### Introduction 概述

So far we have studied the first 29 years of Jesus' life. Most of that time the Savior lived a rather normal life in Nazareth. He spent his time doing the work of a carpenter and studying the Bible. Few people knew him except his family and friends. This all changed when Jesus turned 30. From that time on his life was anything but normal. Now he spent all of his time in public ministry. He traveled throughout Palestine with his disciples （or students） and friends. Wherever he stopped to preach he gathered large crowds. Throughout the Jewish nation the name 'Jesus of Nazareth' became well known. This chapter describes Jesus' early ministry from about January through December of A.D. 27. The story begins, however, six months earlier with John's ministry.

到目前为止我们已经学习了耶稣生平中的前29年。这位救世主大多数时候在拿撒勒过着很平常的生活。他花时间做木匠活儿、学习圣经。除了家人和朋友很少有人了解他。耶稣30岁的时候，这一切都发生了变化。从那时起他的生活根本就不平常了。现在把所有的时间都用在公开传道上。他和使徒（或者学生）、朋友们一起走遍了巴勒斯坦地区。无论何时他停下来讲道，都会聚集大量的人群。“拿撒勒的耶稣”在整个犹太人地区开始被人们熟知。本章节描述了耶稣早期传道的信息，时间大概是从公元27年的1月到12月。然而故事的开始竟然要比约翰的传道早6个月。

#### John the Forerunner （Matt. 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18） 先行者约翰（太3:1-12;可1:1-8;路3:1-18）

John, the son of Zechariah, probably grew up in a small town near Jerusalem. From his father he learned about the special purpose for his life as described by Gabriel and the Old Testament prophets （Is. 40:3-5; Mal. 3:1; 4:5-6）。 Through his study of the Scriptures he gained wisdom concerning the true religion. However, he must have become very sad when he saw how corrupt Jewish worship had become.

撒迦利亚的儿子约翰也许在耶路撒冷旁边的一个小城里长大。约翰从父亲那里知道他的特殊使命，正如利百加和旧约先知书中所说的一样（赛40:3-5;玛3:1;4:5-6）。通过学习经文，约翰获得了有关真正的宗教的智慧。然而，当约翰看到犹太人的敬拜已经变得腐化的时候，他一定很伤心。

Religion for most Jews meant doing many rituals and obeying complex religious laws. One important group of religious Jews, the Pharisees, gave man-made rules and regulations equal importance with the Ten Commandments. Tithes （giving 10 percent of a person's money as an offering to God）， fasting （going without food）， religious washings, and other outward actions became all-important. Often the people forgot about God and the nature of true worship. The Pharisees also mixed politics with their religion. These Jewish patriots wanted to gain independence from the Romans at all costs. They told the people that the long awaited Messiah would be an earthly king who would drive their Roman enemies out of Palestine.

对于大多数犹太人来说，宗教信仰意味着举行很多仪式和遵循复杂的宗教律法。法利赛人是虔诚的犹太人中最重要的群体之一，他们把人所制定的规章制度的重要性等同于十诫。十一奉献（将个人十分之一的钱奉献给上帝，禁食（不吃饭），谨慎地洗净污浊和其他外在的行动都变的非常重要。往往因为这些人们忘记了上帝和真正的敬拜的意义。法利赛人还把政治和他们的信仰混为一谈。这些犹太教的拥护者想要不惜一切的代价从罗马的统治下独立出来。他们告诉人们，长久等待的弥赛亚会成为一位尘世中的王，会将罗马敌军逐出巴勒斯坦。

Another important religious group in Israel was the group known as the Sadducees. They tried to get along with Romans. They rejected the use of man-made laws in the church. But they also denied the resurrection of the body and that there really were angels and demons.

在以色列另外一个重要的宗教团体就是被熟知的撒都该教派。他们试图与罗马人和睦相处。他们拒绝在教会中使用人制定的法律。但是他们也拒绝承认身体的复活，以及天使和魔鬼的真实存在。

Perhaps as a young man John left home and moved to the desert of Judea. In the desert he lived off the land, dressed in clothes made of camel skins, and ate grasshoppers and wild honey. He also had time to think about the doctrines he had learned and the bad religious practices he had seen. Meanwhile, he waited for a message from God.

或许约翰还很年轻的时候就离开了家，来到犹大的旷野。在旷野中，他远离人居之地，穿骆驼毛衣服，吃蝗虫和野蜜。他也有时间思想他所学过的教义，以及他所见过的坏宗教实例。同时，他等待来自上帝的信息。

When John was 30 years old God called him into service. Soon he began preaching and baptizing. His mission was to show people their sinfulness, and, after they repented, to point them to the promised Messiah. The baptism of John had the same purpose as baptism has for us today. Through the water and the Word of God people received forgiveness of sins and, therefore, salvation.

约翰30岁时，上帝呼召他开始事工。很快他开始传道和施洗。他得使命是让人们知道他们是有罪的，同时在人们认罪悔改之后，指引他们转向带来希望的弥赛亚。约翰的施洗和如今我们所接受的洗礼具有相同的目的。通过水和上帝的道，人们被赦罪，得到救赎。

#### The Baptism of Jesus （Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-23） 耶稣受洗（太3:13-17;可1:9-11;路3:21-23）

John had been in the ministry for about six months when Jesus came to the Jordan River asking to be baptized. A person may ask why Jesus chose to be baptized. After all, he was sinless and therefore had no need of this sacrament that gives the forgiveness of sins. However, Jesus' saving mission included perfectly obeying God's law in place of mankind （Matt. 3:15; Gal. 4:4-5）。 God had commanded baptism; therefore, Jesus obeyed. But Jesus did more than just actively obey God's law by being baptised. This was also his entrance into the public ministry. Through his baptism he clearly accepted his mission as the Savior, and received special power from the Holy Spirit to carry out his task.

当耶稣来到约旦河请约翰为他施洗时，约翰已经做神职大约6个月了。有人可能会问，问什么耶稣选择受洗。毕竟他没有犯罪，因此他不需要接受这项赦罪的圣礼仪式。然而，耶稣拯救人类的使命包括完全顺服上帝的律法，而不是人类的律法（太3:15;加4:4-5）。上帝已经指令让耶稣受洗，所以他就遵守。但是耶稣所做的不仅仅是积极地遵守上帝的律法，去接受洗礼。这也是他开始公开讲道的一个突破点。通过受洗他更清楚地接受了作为救世主的使命，而且从圣灵得到了特殊的力量，为完成使命做好准备。

At the time of Jesus' baptism the entire Trinity appeared. Standing before John was God the Son, Jesus Christ. God the Holy Spirit came down in the shape of a dove, and God the Father spoke from heaven. It was only proper that all three persons of the Triune （3-in-1） God revealed themselves at this time. All three were present in the beginning and had created man in their image -- perfect and holy. All three had watched as man fell into sin. Finally, all three had agreed that the only way mankind might be saved was by sending Jesus to earth to live a perfect life and die a perfect death. On this special day the Three-in-One God was publicly showing that Jesus had come to bring salvation to all people.

在耶稣受洗时整个三位一体显现出来。站在约翰面前的是圣父、圣子、耶稣基督。上帝的圣灵以鸽子的样式降下，圣父从天上说话。三位一体中圣父、圣子、圣灵同时显现，上帝在此时显露他们是唯一合适的时间。起初圣父、圣子、圣灵也都显现过，并且已经按照他们的样式造了人——完美且神圣。当人类堕入罪中时，圣父、圣子、圣灵也都注意到了。最后，三一真神认为拯救人类的唯一方法就是，差派耶稣来到世上，成为真正的人并且受死。在这一特别的日子里，三一真神公开表明耶稣已经为全人类带来的了救赎。

#### Jesus Tempted by Satan （Matt. 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13） 耶稣受撒旦试探（太4:1-11;可1:12-13;路4:1-13）

After Jesus was baptized he went into the desert to pray. Because of his human nature, Jesus felt a very real need to talk with his heavenly Father. Here, as throughout his life, Christ spent time in prayer before and after special events.

耶稣受洗之后来到旷野中祷告。因为耶稣的人性，他感觉非常需要和天父交谈。这样，在基督的一生中，在重要的事情发生前后他都花时间祷告。

For a full 40 days Jesus fasted and prayed in the desert. Meanwhile Satan constantly tempted him to sin. （“Satan” is a Hebrew word meaning “adversary” or “enemy;” “devil” is a Greek word meaning “slanderer” or “liar.”） The Evil One lived up to his names, especially during the last three temptations.

耶稣在旷野中禁食祷告满了40天。在这期间魔鬼撒旦不断地引诱他犯罪。（“撒旦”是希伯来文字，意思是“对手”或“仇敌”,“魔鬼”是希腊文字，意思是“造谣中伤者”或“撒谎者”.）魔鬼不虚其名，尤其是在最后三个试探中。

Satan approached Jesus with the word “If” -- “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread” （Matt. 4:3）。 By this simple question the Devil wanted Jesus to use his divine powers for a selfish purpose.

撒旦用“若是”这个字眼试图影响耶稣——“你若是神的儿子，可以吩咐这些石头变成食物”（太4:3）。用这个简单的问题，魔鬼希望耶稣使用神的力量达到个人的目的。

In the second temptation Satan offered Jesus instant glory and acceptance by the people. If Christ jumped from the top of the temple and gently floated to the ground unharmed, many worshipers would see him and immediately accept him as the Messiah. It would have been sinful for Christ to put himself in unnecessary danger and so test his Father's care for him.

在第二次试探中，撒旦为耶稣提供眼下的荣耀和被人们接纳。如果基督从圣殿顶上跳下去，轻轻地落在地上，而且没有任何伤害，很多崇拜者就会看到他，立刻接受他就是弥赛亚的事实。如果基督将自己置于不必要的危险之中以测试天父是否在意他，那么他就犯罪了。

Finally, Satan tried to get Jesus to accept a deal: Jesus could sell his soul to the devil in exchange for earthly power and wealth. Notice how Jesus overcame every temptation by quoting the Scriptures! After the third great temptation Jesus ordered Satan to go away. Because of the power of Jesus' word, the devil had no choice but to obey. Thus the Evil One lost a great battle with the Savior.

最后，撒旦试图让耶稣接受一项交易：耶稣可以出卖自己的灵魂作为交换地上的权势和财富的条件。这里要注意耶稣通过引用经文战胜每一个试探！在第三个极大地试探之后耶稣要撒旦离开。因为耶稣话语的力量，魔鬼别无选择，只能顺服。因此，魔鬼撒旦在这场征战中败给了救世主。

#### Jesus with John （John 1:19-34） 耶稣和约翰（约1:19-34）

After almost six weeks in the desert Jesus went back to the Jordan River and John the Baptist. The day before John had told some Jewish religious leaders that he himself was not the promised Savior, but had come to prepare his way. Now, seeing Jesus coming, John pointed to Christ and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” （John 1:29）！ With these words John simply and clearly described Jesus and his work. First John got the people's attention. Then he gave Jesus the meaningful title of “the Lamb of God.” This name reminded people of the first Passover （Ex. 12:1-13）， when God had led his people out of Egypt long ago. At that time the blood of a lamb was painted on the door frames of every Jewish home. God then sent an angel of death who killed the firstborn son in all the houses of Egypt. But the angel “passed over” the houses where he saw the lamb's blood on the door. Isaiah 53 later prophesied that the Messiah, like the passover lamb, would himself die so that sinners would not have to die. Jesus was that lamb.

耶稣在旷野待了约六个星期之后，回到约旦河，施洗约翰那里。前一天约翰告诉几个犹太教徒的领袖说他不是预言的救世主，而是来预备主的道路的。现在，看见耶稣来了，约翰指着基督说：“看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的。”（约1:29）！约翰用这些话，简单而清晰地描述了耶稣和他的事工。约翰首先引起人们的注意。然后，他给耶稣一个意味深长的称呼“神的羔羊”.这让人们想起第一个逾越节（出12:1-13），那是很久以前上帝带领他的子民逃离埃及。那时每个犹太人家都用羔羊的血涂抹门框。后来上帝派死亡天使杀死了所有埃及人家头生的儿子。但是当天使看到门上有羔羊的血时，就“越过”这户人家了。后来以赛亚书53章预言弥赛亚就像逾越节的羔羊，自己受死，以致罪人不必受死。耶稣就是那只羔羊。

#### Six Disciples Called （John 1:35-51） 耶稣呼召六个门徒（约1:35-51）

In the next two days Jesus called six men to be his disciples: Andrew and his brother Peter, John and his brother James, Philip and his friend Nathanael （also called Bartholomew）。 Jesus knew that one day he would return to his Father in heaven. Through his disciples he would leave on earth a record and witness of what he had said and done, and what it all meant.

在接下来的两天里，耶稣呼召了六个人做他的门徒：安得烈和他的兄弟彼得，约翰和他的兄弟雅各，腓力和他的朋友拿但业（也叫做巴多罗买）。耶稣知道有一天他要回到天父那里去。耶稣通过这些门徒在世上留下记录：他所说的、所做的和这一切的意义。

It is interesting to study the qualities Jesus looked for in his disciples. He did not choose followers who were highly educated or very rich. It appears that John and James may have been the only disciples from middle-class families and who had some education. Nor was Jesus looking for people with one type of personality. Peter was quite outgoing and full of energy, while Andrew was quite different. What all the disciples had in common, however, was a simple sincere faith. They were anxiously waiting for the promised Messiah. Furthermore, their faith produced good works. After learning that Jesus was the promised Savior, Andrew, John and Philip right away found others and brought them to Christ.

耶稣在寻找选择门徒时所看重的品质看起来很有趣。他不选择那些受过高等教育或者富有的信徒。只有约翰和雅各来自中产阶级家庭并接受过一些教育。耶稣也不是只找具备某种个性的人。彼得非常开朗而且精力充沛，而安得烈就非常不同。然而所有这些门徒有一个共同点，就是简单真实的信心。他们一直急切地盼望弥赛亚。进一步而言，他们的信产生了好的行为。在得知耶稣就是救世主之后，约翰和腓力立刻找到别人并带到耶稣面前。

#### The Wedding in Cana （John 2:1-12） 迦拿的婚宴（约2:1-12）

With his six disciples by his side Jesus returned to Nazareth. His mother, Mary, had left for Cana to attend a wedding to which he had also been invited. Since the disciples were Jesus' friends and companions a hurried invitation was extended to them also. At the wedding the supply of wine soon ran out. This embarrassed the wedding couple and their families, because all guests invited to a wedding were to be given proper amounts of food and wine.

耶稣和六个门徒一起回到拿撒勒。耶稣的母亲马利亚去迦拿参加婚礼，他也被邀请参加。既然门徒们是耶稣的朋友和同伴，自然他们也被匆匆邀请去参加婚礼了。在婚宴上储备的酒很快用完了。这让结婚的这对夫妻和他们的家人感到非常窘迫，因为应该供给所有被邀请来参加婚礼的人正常量的食物和酒。

Mary, Jesus' mother, felt that this was a good time for Jesus to reveal himself. For 30 years she had known in her heart that Jesus was true God, the promised Messiah. Now he had shared this secret with his disciples. Mary felt that this would be the right time for him to show others that he was God by helping the bride and groom.

耶稣的母亲马利亚认为这是耶稣显出他的好时候。因为，30年来在她内心里知道耶稣是真神，是预言中的弥赛亚。现在耶稣已经与门徒说了这个秘密。马利亚认为，通过帮助新郎和新娘，正是耶稣向别人显示他就是神的合适时机。

Jesus' response to Mary may seem somewhat harsh to us. He said, “Dear woman, why do you involve me? My time has not yet come” （John 2:4）。 By saying this Jesus wished to remind Mary that she should no longer think of him only as her son. He was the Son of God.

耶稣对马利亚的回答在我们看起来似乎有点残酷。他说：“母亲，我与你有何相干，我的时候还没有到。”（约2:4）。耶稣说这话是希望提醒马利亚，不应该再只把他看做自己的儿子。他是上帝的儿子。

Soon his time did come. He ordered the servants to pour water into the large stone jars that were standing nearby. When these jars were then presented to the master of the wedding, the water had changed to wine.

很快他的时候到了。他命令仆人把附近的几口大石头缸倒满水。当这些缸被展现给婚礼的主人的时候，水已经变成了酒。

It may or may not be important that Jesus had brought along six disciples, and he turned six jars of water into wine. In any case, wedding guests drank some of the many gallons of wine provided by Jesus. The remainder served as a wedding gift to the young married couple.

耶稣带来六个使徒，又使六口缸的水变成了酒，这也许重要，也许并不重要。不管怎样，参加婚宴的宾客喝了很多耶稣变的酒。

We should note several points about this story in Jesus' life. By going to the wedding Christ showed that he approved of marriage. He also showed his loving concern for and desire to help people with their problems in life. But above all, “He thus revealed his glory” （John 2:11） to the disciples. He proved through this miracle that he was the promised Messiah, and the disciples' faith in Jesus increased.

关于耶稣在世间的这个故事我们应该注意到几点。通过参加婚礼基督表明他赞同婚姻。也表明了他乐意关心并且渴望帮助人们解决生活中的难题。但最重要的是，向门徒们“显出他的荣耀来”（约2:11）。借由这件神迹，耶稣证明了他是预言要来的弥赛亚，同时门徒的对耶稣的信也增加了。

#### First Cleansing of the Temple （John 2:13-25） 第一次洁净圣殿（约2:13-25）

The wedding at Cana probably took place some time in March of the year A.D. 27. After the wedding feast Jesus, together with his mother, brothers, and disciples, went to Capernaum for a few days. From there （most likely without Mary） they went along with the many pilgrims who were traveling to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover festival.

迦拿的婚礼大约发生在公元27年3月的某个时间。喜宴之后耶稣和他母亲、弟兄和门徒一起去迦百农住了不多几日。从迦百农开始他们与很多去耶路撒冷庆祝逾越节的朝圣者们一起结伴而行（没有和马利亚在一起的可能性很大）。

Jesus may have made this trip each year since he was 12 years old. But this time it would be different. Now he would begin his public ministry. It was time to fulfill the 475 year old prophecy of Malachi （3:1）： “Suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come, says the Lord Almighty.”

耶稣从12岁开始每年都要去耶路撒冷。但是这次会有所不同。现在他要开始公开传道。是时候实现475年前玛拉基书的预言了：“万军之耶和华说，你们所寻求的主，必忽然进入他的殿；立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，快要到来。”

The holy temple complex in Jerusalem was a very large group of buildings. King Herod had begun the building project 46 years earlier. The Jewish historian Josephus said, “The money spent on this work could not be counted; no building ever was more magnificent.” The real importance of the temple, however, should not have been the buildings themselves, but the worship that took place there.

位于耶路撒冷的圣殿是一个非常大的建筑群。早在46年前希律王就开始建造圣殿。犹太历史学家约瑟夫斯说：“无法计算花在这项工程上的钱；也从来没有过这样壮丽的建筑。”但是，圣殿的重要性的真正所在，并不是建筑本身，而是这里所发生的敬拜。

God's House was to be a place of sacrifice and prayer. God planned the sacrifices to serve two purposes. By requiring the death of an animal, God was reminding man of the cost of sin. And by requiring the life of an “innocent” animal in the place of the sinner, he was pointing forward to the Savior who one day would be sacrificed for the sins of all mankind. Because of these pictures that pointed to the results of sin and unearned salvation that came through a “substitute,” it is easy to understand why the temple was a house of prayer （Is. 56:7）。 Here sinners could come and tell God of their sorrow, repentance, hope for salvation, and thanksgiving.

上帝的殿是献祭和祷告的地方。上帝所设计的献祭有两个目的。通过要一种动物的死，上帝提醒人罪的代价。又通过一种无辜的动物的生命来代替罪，上帝预示了救世主将来会为了全人类的罪而牺牲。因为这些画面表明了罪的结果，也表明了人类不配得的拯救由“替代品”来实现，所以为什么圣殿是祷告的殿就容易理解了（赛56:7）。这样有罪的人就可以来到殿中，将他们的悔恨、悔改、期望得到拯救和感恩告诉上帝。

However, by the time of Christ, greed had brought problems to proper temple worship. Jews and proselytes （Gentiles who had converted to the Jewish religion）， except for the women, slaves and children, had to pay a half-shekel temple tax （Exod. 30:11-16）。 Most preferred to pay during the Passover festival. Hence, there was a need for moneychangers to change the foreign money carried by many pilgrims for Jewish coins.

然而到了基督的时代，贪婪给圣殿正常的敬拜带来了问题。除了妇女、奴隶和孩子，犹太教徒和皈依犹太教的人（皈依犹太教的外邦人），都必须支付舍客勒的殿税（出30:11-16）。大多数人宁愿在逾越节期间支付。因此，就有兑换钱币的需求了，很多朝圣者带来的外币需要兑换成犹太币。

Herds of animals were also kept at the temple. Here Jewish pilgrims could buy the animals they wished to sacrifice to the Lord. This was much easier than bringing them from their homes far away. But a problem developed in the location of these moneychangers and animal sellers. Greedy Jewish people moved the places where they sold these things closer and closer to the temple. Finally they set up shop right in the temple courtyard. The holy temple designed for worship and prayer became filled with the noise of cattle, sheep, doves, and these sellers, as well as the smell of the animals.

大量的牲畜也被留在圣殿里。在这里犹太朝圣者可以买到他们牲畜献祭给主。这要比从很远的家中带来容易得多了。但是在这些兑换钱币买卖牲畜的地点问题就出现了。贪婪的犹太人把卖这些东西的地方移到离圣殿越来越近的地方，这样祷告的地方充满了牛、羊、鸽子和叫卖的声音，还有动物发出的气味。

Jesus did “suddenly . . . come to his temple.” He entered the courts, made a whip of ropes and drove out the animals. He then went to the tables of the moneychangers and tipped them over, causing their coins to roll on the ground. Finally, he went to the birdcages and ordered the doves removed.

耶稣“突然…来到他的殿中。”他进入殿中，拿绳子做成的鞭子赶出了牲畜。然后他走到兑换钱币的桌子前，推翻了桌子，钱币撒了一地。最后，他又到卖鸽子的人前让他们离开。

That day Jesus not only cleansed the temple, he also publicly identified himself as the Messiah. To the merchants Jesus exclaimed （John 2:16）， “Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!” Christ was the Messiah and he alone could call the temple “my” Father's house. Later, when questioned about his authority he answered in a riddle. The temple of his body would be destroyed （on the cross）， but in three days it would be rebuilt （the Resurrection）。 At the very beginning of his ministry he pointed to the end.

这一天耶稣不仅洁净了圣殿，还公开确认他就是弥赛亚。耶稣对那些商人说（约2:16）：“把这些东西拿去！不要将我父的殿当做买卖的地方！”基督就是弥赛亚，只有他能够称呼圣殿为“我”父的殿。后来，当他的权柄被质疑时，他用一个难解之谜来回答。他身体的殿会损坏（在十字架上），但是三天之后又会重建（复活）。在他传道的刚开始他就表明了最终的结局。

#### Jesus and Nicodemus （John 3:1-21） 耶稣和尼哥底母（约3:1-21）

In the days that followed Jesus moved among the people, taught them, and did miracles （John 2:23）。 As a result many of the pilgrims came to believe in him. The Jewish religious leaders, however, were not ready to listen to him. There was one exception, Nicodemus.

在耶路撒冷过逾越节的这些日子里，耶稣在人们中间活动，教导他们，施行神迹（约2:23）。结果是很多朝圣者都信了他。然而犹太教的领袖并不听从他。尼哥底母是个例外。

John tells us that Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin （3:1）。 From this we can be certain of several things. As a Pharisee he wished to earn salvation by obeying the laws of the Bible and the other man-made religious laws. As a member of the Sanhedrin he would help judge people accused of false teaching, worshiping false gods, or acting as false prophets. Thus, he should have had a deep understanding of the Old Testament.

约翰福音里说到尼哥底母是法利赛人，是犹太人的官，议员（3:1）。据此有几点我们可以明确：作为法利赛人，他希望通过顺服圣经的律法和其他人制定的宗教律法，而得到救赎；作为议会的议员，他对人们控告错误的教导、敬拜假神或者假先知等做出审判。

To avoid being seen by other leaders, Nicodemus came to see Jesus at night. He admitted that Jesus was a rabbi （teacher of God's word） and had divine power to do miracles. Jesus then turned the discussion to God's plan for mankind. First the master showed Nicodemus that man by himself can never earn citizenship in the Kingdom of God. For that to happen a deep change has to take place. Through the preaching of the Word and the Baptism of repentance the Holy Spirit makes this change. Nicodemus, a student of the Bible, should have known this, but his mind had been tricked by his human reason.

为了避免被其他的官看到，尼哥底母在晚上来见耶稣。他承认耶稣是拉比（传讲上帝的道的老师），有神的力量行神迹。耶稣随后把讨论的话题转到上帝给人类的计划上。首先向尼哥底母表明，人类靠着自己永远也不能成为天国的子民。要进入神的国必然要发生深层的改变。通过传讲神的道，接受悔改的洗礼，圣灵使之改变。尼哥底母，同样也学习圣经，应该知道这一点，但是他的思想已经被他的人性的推理所欺骗。

Then Jesus preached the Gospel using an Old Testament picture. Long ago in the desert poisonous snakes had begun to bite God's people （Num. 21:4-9）。 Some of the people obeyed God and looked at a bronze snake that Moses had placed on a pole. Faith in God's promise brought them healing. But the snake was merely a picture of the spiritual salvation that was to come through Jesus Christ. Jesus would be “lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life” （John 3:14-15）。

耶稣使用旧约的情景传讲福音。在很久以前的旷野中毒蛇已经开始吞噬上帝的子民（民21:4-9）。有些人顺服上帝，望了摩西挂在杆子上的铜蛇。对上帝诺言的信靠让他们痊愈了。但是这蛇只不过是灵魂拯救的写照，这拯救来自耶稣基督。耶稣会被“举起，叫一切信他的都得永生”（约3:14-15）

Finally, Christ showed Nicodemus that man can never earn his own salvation. Only God's undeserved love, through Jesus, can do that. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” （John 3:16）。

最后，基督向尼哥底母表明，人类永远无法自救。只有上帝给人类的那种不配的的爱，通过耶稣，能够实现拯救。“因为神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生”（约3:16）

#### Early Judean Ministry （John 3:22-36） 早期在犹太地传道 （约3:22-36）

A few days later Jesus left Jerusalem. For the next eight months （May through December, A.D. 27） He taught and baptized in the countryside of Judea （John 3:22）。 Actually, Jesus himself did not baptize, but he did so through his disciples （John 4:2）。

几天后耶稣离开耶路撒冷。在接下来八个月里（公元27年5月到12月）耶稣在犹太地教导和施洗（约3:22）。实际上耶稣本人不施洗，而是通过他的使徒给人们施洗（约4:2）。

During this time disciples who earlier had gathered around John the Baptist began following Jesus instead. This made some of John's disciples upset. John, however, knew what his job was in God's plan of salvation. He directed all who would listen to Jesus Christ （John 3:22-36）。 John's ministry was now almost completed. He had prepared the way for the Lord. Jesus the Savior would now be the center of men's attention, while John would be put in prison, killed, and be taken to heavenly glory.

在此期间，那些早就拥护施洗约翰的门徒开始转而跟随耶稣。这让约翰的一些门徒有些失落。然而约翰知道他所做的在上帝的拯救计划之中。他引导所有人听从耶稣基督（约3::2-36）。到此，约翰的使命几乎完成了。他已经为主预备了道路。救世主耶稣现将成为人们注意的焦点，而约翰会被下到监里，被杀害，被荣耀地接到天堂。
