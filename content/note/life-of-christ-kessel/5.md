#### Introduction 概述

When Jesus was baptized he received special strength from the Holy Spirit （see Chapter 2）。 Now that we have studied the first year and a half of Jesus ministry, we can see why he needed that strength. The religious leaders were constantly objecting to what Jesus did and said. And yet Jesus kept complete control of himself and always kept a proper Christian view of his ministry. In this chapter we continue our look at Jesus' Great Galilean Ministry （June-October, A.D. 28）。 Once again we see him despised and rejected by many, yet filled with love and compassion. Boldly he continues his mission of sharing the Gospel message.

耶稣受洗时从圣灵得到特别的力量（参照第二章）。到此为止我们已经学习了耶稣一年半的传道经历，我们能看出为什么他需要那种特别的力量。宗教领袖不断地反对耶稣的所行与言论。然而耶稣同时也完全地控制自己，总是保持职分中合宜的基督的观点。在本章中我们继续看看耶稣伟大的加利利地区传道生活（公元28年6-10月）。从中我们再次看到耶稣被很多人鄙视和敌对，然而他仍然充满爱和怜悯。他继续大胆地完成分享福音的使命。

#### A Model Christian Faith （Matt. 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10） 基督徒信心的典范（太8:5-13;路7:1-10）

After his Sermon on the Mount Jesus returned to Capernaum. There some Jewish elders came to Jesus asking him to help a Gentile （non-Jew）。 They told him about a Roman captain who wished Jesus to heal his sick and dying servant. Of course, Jesus healed the servant. He even commented, “I have not found such great faith even in Israel” （Luke 7:9）。

耶稣在山上讲完道之后就回到迦百农。有几个犹太长老到耶稣那儿请求他帮助一个外邦人（不是犹太人）。他们告诉耶稣，有一个罗马百夫长希望耶稣能医治他的仆人，这仆人害病快要死了。当然耶稣医治了这个仆人。他甚至说：“这么大的信心，就是在以色列中，我也没有遇见过。”（路7:9）。

Luke 7:1-10 reveals what Christ calls a great faith. The captain was humbled because of his sins. He admitted that he was not worthy of Jesus' help （vv 6-7a）。 Yet he firmly trusted that Jesus was willing and able to help （vv 7b-8）。 Finally, his faith in God produced good works （vv 4-5） including his concern for his servant's life （vv 2-3）。

路加福音7:1-10的经文中向众人揭示了基督所认为最大的信心。百夫长因为自己的罪而谦卑。他承认自己不配得耶稣的帮助（6-7a节）。然而他坚信耶稣愿意并能够帮助他（7b-8节）。最终他对上帝的信心得到了好结果（4-5节），包括他对仆人生命的关注（2-3节）。

#### Raising A Widow's Son （Luke 7:11-17） 使寡妇之子复活（路加福音7:11-17）

From Capernaum Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd traveled about 25 miles to the southwest to the town of Nain. There they witnessed a sad sight. A group of people were carrying a young man who had died to the cemetery. His mother, a widow, was now left all alone. Jesus had mercy on the mother, touched the coffin and ordered the dead boy to arise. Immediately the young man sat up and spoke. Those who witnessed this miracle should have worshiped Jesus as the Messiah. Instead many thought he was just another prophet like Elijah or Elisha, who had worked similar miracles （1 Kings 17:21; 2 Kings 4:35）。 But Jesus did not have to pray first. He could perform this kind of miracle by his own authority and power.

耶稣和门徒还有极多的人从迦百农行走了25英里，到了西南的拿因城。在那儿他们目睹了令人伤心的情景。一群人正抬着一位已经死的年轻人去墓地。他的母亲是个寡妇，如今就只孤零零一个人了。耶稣怜悯他母亲，就按着杠吩咐那死人起来。那年轻人就坐起来，并且说话。那些目睹耶稣所行的神迹的人们本应该敬拜耶稣，称他为弥赛亚。然而很多人认为耶稣只是像以利亚或者以利沙一样的另一先知而已，这两位先知也曾行过相同的神迹（王上17:21;王下4:35）。但是耶稣没有先祷告。他能用自己的权柄和大能行这种神迹。

#### Messengers from John （Matt. 11:2-19; Luke 7.18-35） 约翰差人来问耶稣（太11:2-19;路7:18-35）

Jesus passed the summer months in Galilee, preaching, teaching, and healing. Meanwhile 70 miles to the south John the Baptist was locked in a prison. It seems that Herod let John's disciples visit their master from time to time. Some of them must have told John they were confused about Jesus. If he was the Messiah, why did he not come and rescue John the forerunner?

耶稣在加利利度过了整个夏季，讲道、教导、医治。在这期间，施洗约翰被关在从加利利向南70英里的监狱里。从这段经文中看起来似乎希律王让施洗约翰偶尔拜访他们的主。有些人一定已经告诉约翰他们对于耶稣的困惑。如果他是弥赛亚，为什么不来解救先来为他铺平道路的约翰呢？

Rather than answer their questions directly, John sent two of his followers to Jesus. When they found him they asked, “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?” （Luke 7:19）。 Jesus answered by inviting them to see for themselves whether he was fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies. They quickly saw that Jesus was fulfilling them!

约翰没有直接回答他们的问题，而是差了两个门徒到耶稣那里去。当他们找到耶稣时就问：“那将要来的是你吗？还是我们要等候别人呢？”（路加福音7:19）。耶稣通过让邀请他们自己来看看是否他正在实现旧约预言来回答这个问题。他们很快见到了耶稣正在实现那些预言！

As the two disciples left, Jesus looked at the crowd around him. His heart was filled with deep disappointment. Although Jesus was very clear in his teachings and showed that he was God in many ways, many of the people refused to believe or did not immediately believe. There were only a few loyal followers like John. And while some people had accepted John's testimony and baptism, most were like the Pharisees and Scribes. They did not accept but rather laughed at John or spoke evil of his teachings. They thought that demons were causing John to lead such a simple way of life in the desert. In the same way they would not listen to Jesus. They thought he was not religious enough because he ate and drank like the common people.

这两个门徒走后，耶稣看着周围的会众。他的心充满了深深的失望。尽管耶稣在教导中说得很清楚，也用很多方式显明了他就是上帝，但还是有很多人拒绝相信或者不是立即相信。像约翰这样忠实的门徒只有几个。一些人接受约翰的见证和洗礼，更多的人则像法利赛人和文士一样，心存怀疑。他们不接受，反而嘲笑约翰或者恶言相对耶稣的教导。同样他们不愿听从耶稣。他们认为耶稣不够虔诚，因为他像常人一样又吃又喝。

#### Condemning of Three Cities （Matt. 11:20-30） 宣判三个城市 （太11:20-30）

Elsewhere things were very much the same. The cities of Korizin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum are cases in point. During his ministry Jesus had visited the first two of these cities and had performed mighty miracles. Then there was Capernaum, the most honored of all cities, Jesus' mission headquarters. There the local people had witnessed many of his miracles.

在别处事情也照样发生。哥拉汛、伯赛大好迦百农是例证。耶稣在传道过程中到过前面的的两个城，并行了大神迹。然后来到迦百农，是所有城中最具荣光的城，也是耶稣布道的中心。在迦百农当地的百姓见证了很多奇迹。

While it is true that the people of these cities were impressed by Jesus' miracles and flocked to see him and to have him satisfy their needs, nevertheless, “they did not repent” （Matt. 11:20）。 To them, Jesus was a doer of good deeds, not a long awaited and much needed savior from sin. Consequently, Jesus pronounced a curse. On Judgment Day it would be more tolerable for the pagans of ancient Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom than for the three cities of Jesus' day. （By the way, this story also shows that there are different amounts of suffering in hell.）

这些城的百姓对耶稣所行的神迹印象深刻，而且成群结队地去见耶稣，让耶稣满足他们的需要，然而，“他们不悔改”（太11:20）。对于他们来说耶稣是做好事的实干家，不是一直等待到来的、更需要的将他们从罪中拯救的救世主。因此，耶稣宣告了一个咒诅。到审判的日子，推罗、西顿和所多玛所受的，比耶稣在世的这三个城要容易受。（顺便说一下，这个故事也表明了在地狱里所要受的苦是有分别的。）

In spite of so many unbelievers Christ's ministry was like a fruit tree - it did produce fruit or results. As promised （Is. 55:11）， God's Word does change the hearts of people. Looking on the brighter side, Jesus thanked his Father for those whose hearts had been changed. Finally, to show that God's grace was for everyone, Jesus invited all people to exchange the guilt of their sins for his spiritual rest, peace and security.

尽管有很多不信的人，基督的传道像果树一样——的的确确生出果子或者卓有成效。正如先知书所预言的一样（赛55:11）上帝的道让百姓心意更新。耶稣看到令人高兴的一面，为那些心意已经改变的人向上帝献上感谢。最终，为了显明上帝的恩典是给每个人的，耶稣邀请所有会众用他的灵魂的安息、安心和安全替代他们罪的捆绑。

#### Jesus' Feet Anointed （Luke 7:36-50） 耶稣的脚被膏抹（路加福音7:36-50）

By now Jesus was very famous around Galilee. Simon the Pharisee hoped to increase his own social position by inviting Jesus to dinner in his home. While Simon appeared friendly, he did not greet Jesus with a kiss, and he did not have his servants wash Jesus' dusty feet. These were the normal ways people showed hospitality to their guests.

迄今为止，耶稣已经闻名于加利利地区周边一带。法利赛人西门想要通过邀请耶稣到家里坐席来提高自己的社会地位。虽然西门表现得很友好，但是他没有用亲吻来问耶稣的安，也没有让仆人洗耶稣已经脏的脚。这是人们殷勤招待宾客正常的方式。

While they were dining, a woman entered the room. Some people recognized her as a woman who earned money by having sex with men. Now, however, she was crying because of her sin. She completely humbled herself before Christ, washing his feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair. Seeing this, the host Simon decided that Jesus really could not be a prophet, because he did not seem to know that this woman was a very bad sinner. But Jesus did know. Through a parable he taught that people like this woman who feel their sins most deeply, will love God the most when they come to know his forgiveness. So Jesus assured her that her sins were forgiven, noting that her faith had saved her. Only God can forgive sins. The other dinner guests questioned in their minds by what right Jesus could forgive her those sins. They could still not see that Jesus could do this because he was God.

在他们正吃饭的时候，有一个女人进了屋内。有些人认出她是那靠着与男人上床赚钱的女人。然而此刻她正为自己的罪而哭泣。在基督面前他完全地降卑自己，她用眼泪为耶稣洗脚，并用头发擦干。主人西门见此情景就认定耶稣果真不是先知，因为看上去他不知道这女人是个罪人。耶稣当然知道。他用一个比喻教导人们：像这妇人一样知道自己罪孽深重的人，当他们知道耶稣的宽恕时，将会更爱上帝。因此耶稣确认她的罪赦免了，她的信救了她。只有上帝能够赦罪。同席的人心中疑惑耶稣是靠着什么权利赦免她的罪的。他们依然没无法看到耶稣能做这事正因为他就是上帝。

Before leaving this story we should talk about who this woman was. Many writers have claimed that she was Mary Magdalene. In fact, today most Christians think of Mary as a converted prostitute or adulteress. But nowhere does Scripture say this. Therefore, we should not either. The Eighth Commandment tells us that we should speak well of people, so we should do the same to Mary Magdelene.

在结束这个故事之前，我们应该讨论一下这妇人到底是谁。很多作者断言她就是抹大拉的马利亚。事实上，现在很多基督徒认为马利亚是改变信仰的卖淫女或者奸妇。但经文中没有提到这些。因此，我们也不确定。第八条诫命告诉我们，要说人的好话，所以对抹大拉的马利亚我们也应该如此行。

#### Preaching Throughout Galilee （Luke 8:1-3） 在整个加利利地区传道（路加福音8:1-3）

The next several weeks, perhaps months, of Christ's ministry are summarized in three short verses （Luke 8:1-3）。 Yet, in this brief summary we have answers to two very interesting questions: on what subject did Jesus preach, and where did he get money or food to carry on his ministry?

接下来的几个星期里，或许是几个月的时间里，圣经中用短短的三节经文概述了（路8:1-3）。然而在这短短的叙述中，我们能找到两个有趣的问题的答案：耶稣讲道的主题是什么？继续进行传道所需的钱和实物由哪儿来？

Throughout the villages and cities of Galilee Jesus preached “the good news of the kingdom of God.” In fact, there are three separate instances of Jesus' preaching in Galilee: first, Mark 1:39 and Luke 4:43; second, Luke 8:1; third, Mark 6:6 and Matt. 9:35. In each case he preached the same message, the good news of the Kingdom of God or Heaven.

走遍加利利各城各乡，耶稣宣讲“神国的福音。”事实上耶稣在加利利的传道包括三个单独的例子：第一，马可福音1:39和路加福音4:43;第二，路加福音8:1;第三，马可福音6:6和马太福音9:35.在每个事例中他都传讲相同的信息，即神国或天国的福音。

Briefly, the Kingdom of God is the rule of God, through the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of believers. Those who through the work of the Spirit believe in Jesus as Savior are no longer subjects of Satan's Kingdom, but belong to God. Thus Christ preached the Gospel. He preached about himself （John 3:16）。

简单地说，神的国度就是神藉着圣灵在信徒的心中作王。那些由圣灵做工而信耶稣是救世主的人不再属于撒旦国度了，而属于上帝。因此基督传扬福音。他所传的正是他自己（约翰福音3:16）。

Godly women made freewill offerings so that Jesus and his disciples could devote their full time to ministry. Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Susanna. They can also teach us how we too can use our time, money and talents the way God would want us to （Christian stewardship）。 Their faith in Christ led them to show love and do good works.

属神的妇女们自愿奉献，好让耶稣和门徒能全时间去传道。在这妇人中就有抹大拉的马利亚，约亚拿和苏撒拿。他们的行为也教导我们应该如何按照上帝所期望的方式使用我们的时间、金钱和才能（基督徒管理）。他们对基督的信让他们彰显爱并做好的事。

#### Jesus' Busiest Day 耶稣最忙碌的一天

We now begin a study of the busiest day in the life of Jesus Christ. It was a day of working miracles, preaching, speaking in parables, and confronting the unbelievers. Above all it was a day when the Lord showed his love for lost souls.

现在我们开始学习耶稣基督生命中最忙碌的一天。这是行神迹、讲道、做比喻和面对非信徒的一天。更重要的是这一天正是主对失丧的灵魂显出爱的一天。

#### Jesus Throws Out a Demon and is Accused of Devilry （Matt. 12:22-45; Mark 3:19-30; Luke 11:14-36） 耶稣赶出污鬼和被指责（太12:22-45;可3:19-30;路11:14-36）

It was late summer or early fall of A.D. 28 when Jesus and his disciples finally set out for home. Possibly about noon they arrived in Capernaum hungry and tired from a long walk. No sooner had they sat down to eat than a great crowd gathered to hear Jesus. As he did so often, Jesus forgot about his own needs and thought of other people first. He began to preach words of spiritual rest and to fill the listeners with the Gospel. But his friends did not understand this total concern for the ministry. They thought it showed that he was insane （Mark 3:21）。

耶稣和门徒最终动身回家是在公元28年的夏末或初秋时节。他们大约在中午到达迦百农，经过长途跋涉，他们又累又饿。他们刚坐下来要吃饭，就有一大群人聚集起来要听耶稣讲道。和往常一样，耶稣忘记自己的劳累与饥饿，而首先考虑别人的需求。他开始讲有关灵的休息的话题，并用福音充满那些听众们。但是，他对传道的全然关注，他的朋友们并不理解。他们认为耶稣有点癫狂了（可3:21）。

That afternoon Jesus healed a man who could not hear or speak by throwing a demon out of him. When the crowd saw this, they began to compare Jesus to the promised Messiah. But the Pharisees, in order to protect their own power, accused Jesus of being controlled by Satan （Beelzebub）。 They said that he was doing his miracles through the devil's power.

那天下午耶稣治好了一个不能听或者不能说的人，将他里面的污鬼赶出。当会众看到这些时，就开始把耶稣与将来的弥赛亚相比。但是法利赛人为了保护他们自己的权势，就指责耶稣被撒旦（别西卜）所掌控。他们说耶稣靠着魔鬼的能力行出这些神迹。

Jesus defended himself with common sense. “Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub. Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out” （Luke 11:17-19）？

耶稣用常识为自己辩护。“凡一国自相纷争，就成为荒场；凡一家自相纷争，就必败落。若撒旦自相纷争，他的国怎能站得住呢？因为你们说我是靠着别西卜赶鬼。我若靠着别西卜赶鬼，你们的子弟赶鬼又靠谁呢”（路11:17-19）？

Christ went on to speak about a type of sin that could not be forgiven-a sin against the Holy Spirit. Although this sin is often not understood or used properly, it is really not so puzzling.

基督继续讲，敌对圣灵的这类罪是不能被赦免的。尽管这种罪经常不被理解或者正确使用，但是确实不那么令人费解。

The work of the Holy Spirit is to lead man to repent of his sins and believe in Jesus Christ （2 Cor. 7:10; 1 Cor. 12:3）。 But sometimes a person who has come to faith later decides to speak or act against the Holy Spirit. He rejects all attempts made by the Spirit to influence him and recall him to faith. If this happens and he no longer listens to the Spirit, how can he repentance and come to faith again? （Also compare Luke 12:10; 1 John 5:16; Heb. 6:4-8）。

圣灵做工引到人们认罪悔改，并相信耶稣基督（林后7:10;林前12:3）。但有时已经信的人后来决心在言语或行为上干犯圣灵。他拒绝所有圣灵所发出的信号，那些影响他、让他回转信主的声音。如果这些发生在他身上，他就再也不听从圣灵，那么他怎么能认罪悔改、再次相信呢？（此处亦可对照路加福音12:10;约翰一书5:16;来6:4-8）。

Jesus' logical words and his stern warning did not bring the Pharisees to repent. Now they demanded that Jesus show them some miracle or sign to prove he was God's Son. They forgot all about Jesus' earlier miracles. So Jesus refused to give another sign at that time. Instead, he hinted that soon the greatest of all signs would take place. Just as in the Old Testament Jonah （1:17） was in the fish for three nights and days and then was thrown up on the shore alive, so Christ would die and three days later be seen alive.

耶稣符合逻辑的话语和严厉的警告没能让法利赛人悔改。现在他们要求耶稣像他们显示神迹或者记号，以证明他是上帝的儿子。他们全然忘记了耶稣之前所行得神迹。所以那时耶稣拒绝了他们。耶稣反而是暗示他们，所有记号中最大的一个很快就会发生了。正如旧约中约拿（1:17）在鱼腹中三日三夜后被活着吐在岸边一样，基督将受死，三日后复活。

#### Jesus' Nearest Relatives （Matt. 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21） 耶稣的近亲（太12:46-50;可3:31-35;路8:19-21）

Jesus' miracle and teaching reached the heart of one woman in the crowd. Unable to keep quiet, she began to cry out. She asked God to bless the mother who had given birth to Jesus. While this was fulfilling Mary's own prophecy （Luke 1:48） Jesus soon directed attention away from Mary to the blessings God wishes to give to all who believe - “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it” （Luke 11:28）。

耶稣的神迹和教导深入会众中一位妇人的心。她无法再保持安静，开始大哭起来。她请求上帝祝福那生了耶稣的母亲。而这正应验了马利亚自己的预言（路加福音1:48），耶稣很快将大家的注意力从马利亚转到祝福上，就是上帝要给所有信的人的福分——“是却还不如听神的道而遵守的人有福”（路11:28）。

About this time Mary, along with Jesus' half-brothers and half-sisters, appeared. They wished to save Jesus from overworking himself. In a reply which reminds us of an earlier story （Jesus at age 12 in the temple, Luke 2:49）， Jesus said that he was doing his Father's business, building the household of God.

大约在此时，马利亚和耶稣的同母异父的兄弟姐妹们一起出现了。他们想要把耶稣从过度的工作中解救出来。耶稣说他正在以他父的事为念，正在建造上帝的家，他的回答让我们想起之前的一个故事（耶稣12岁时在殿中所说的，路加福音2:49）。

#### Parables of the Kingdom （Matt. 13:1-53; Mark 4:1-34; Luke 8:4-18） 国度的比喻（太13:1-53;可：1-34;路8:4-18）

By now it was probably mid-afternoon. Jesus and the crowd left the home and went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. There Jesus entered a boat and used it to preach to the crowd which sat on the beach. He spoke in parables. A parable is an earthly story with a heavenly meaning. With simple stories from everyday life, Jesus now taught the people.

现在差不多已经是下午晚些时候了。耶稣和会众离开家去了加利利海的岸边。耶稣上了一艘小船，在船上对着坐在岸上的会众讲道。比喻就是地上的故事指代天国的含义。耶稣现在用日常生活中简单的故事教导人。

Someone might ask why Jesus chose to speak in parables rather than in a sermon. While Christ used parables throughout his ministry, he did so most often when popular opinion was against him. At such times he could openly speak in parables. Those who believed in him would understand, while those who didn't would remain confused.

What did Jesus' parables mean? The simplest way for us to determine the meaning of a parable is to follow three simple rules. First, see whether Christ himself gives the meaning. Second, look at the rest of the story to see if that explains the meaning. Usually some event or series of events inspired their use and gives a clue to their meaning. Third, know that each parable has only one central truth. The details which give color to the earthly story usually add little to the heavenly meaning.

有人可能会问，为什么耶稣选择讲比喻而不是用讲道进行一大通教训。然而在整个传道的过程中，基督都使用比喻，他大多数时候是在大众的观点与他的不同时使用比喻。这时他会公开地讲比喻。那些信他的人会理解比喻的意思，而那些不信的人仍然很疑惑。

耶稣的比喻是什么意思呢？对于我们来说要确定比喻的意思，最简单的方法就是要遵循三个简单的规则。第一，先看是否基督自己解释了比喻的意思。第二，查看故事其余的部分看看是否有解释。通常有些事件或者一系列的事件会有所启迪，给出线索。第三，要知道每个比喻都仅有一个总的真理在里面。那些使地上故事看起来更真实的细节通常没有多少属天含义。

Jesus spoke eight parables, all concerning the Kingdom of Heaven. The first five were addressed to the crowd on the beach. After that he moved to a house in Capernaum and spoke the last three. The parables are of:

耶稣讲的八个比喻都与天国有关。前面五个是讲给岸边的会众的。随后他到了迦百农讲了后面三个。比喻如下：

1. The Sower

    撒种

2. The Tares Among the Wheat

    稗子

3. The Seed Growing by Itself

    种子生长

4. The Mustard Seed

    芥菜种

5. The Leaven

    酵母

6. The Treasure in the Field

    地里的财宝

7. The Pearl of Great Price

    昂贵的珠子

8. The Net Cast into the Sea

    撒网

Parables 1, 6 and 7 show how the kingdom of God is planted and grows in the heart of a person, while the others show how the kingdom develops in the world.

第一、第六和第七项比喻显明上帝的国度是如何植入人心并生长的，其他几个比喻显明神国如何在世界上发展。

#### Stilling the Storm （Matt, 8:18-27; Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25, 9:57-62） 平静风浪（太8:18-27;可4:35-41;路8:22-25,9:57-62）

By now it was evening. To escape the crowd Jesus and the disciples found a boat to take them across the Sea of Galilee. Before they could leave, however, three men asked to become his disciples. Jesus warned them that such a commitment would mean great personal sacrifice. They would have to put God's work first in their lives. The men left.

现在夜晚已经来临。为了避开人群，耶稣和门徒们找到一艘船带他们穿过加利利海。然而在他们离开之前，三个人想要成为耶稣的门徒。耶稣告诫他们成为他的门徒意味着巨大的个人牺牲。他们必须把上帝的事放在生命的首位。那人就离开了。

Jesus and the disciples then began to sail across the lake. Jesus soon fell into a deep sleep. As frequently happens on that sea, a sudden and violent storm arose. The boat began to sink. The disciples were full of terror and woke Jesus. They shouted, “Teacher, don't you care if we drown?” （Mark 4:38）。

耶稣和门徒随后开始乘船度过加利利湖。耶稣很快就熟睡了。海上突然起了风暴，这在加利利海是常发生的事。船开始下沉。门徒们非常恐惧就叫醒耶稣。他们喊道：“夫子，我们丧命，你不顾吗？”（可4:38）。

Jesus got up and took care of the problem. He spoke two commands. “Silence, be quiet” （Mark 4:39）！ Immediately there was a complete calm. The disciples were totally amazed. Thus, Jesus' busiest day came to a close.

耶稣起来解决他们的问题。他发出了两项指令。“住了吧，静了吧”（可4:39）！海面立刻平静了。门徒们全然惊呆了。至此，耶稣最忙碌的一天结束了。
