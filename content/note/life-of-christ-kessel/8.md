#### Introduction 简介

Isaiah the prophet foretold that the Messiah would be “despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering” （53:3）。 This was a very good description of Jesus. He had labored for over a year and a half in Galilee, yet, for the most part, the seed of his saving Word did not produce fruit. Instead of being accepted as the Savior, the Lord was called a demon or false prophet. Now as Jesus made up his mind to go to Jerusalem （Luke 9:51） he fully understood that once again he would be despised and rejected and finally put to death. However this was why he had been born （Matt. 20:28）。


先知以赛亚预言说，弥赛亚将会“被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患。”（以赛亚书53:3）。这是对耶稣一个很好的描述。他已经在加利利辛苦了超过一年半的时间，然而，对于那最重要的部分，他救恩话语的种子没有结出果实来。救主不单没有被接受，反而被称为鬼王或假先知。现在当耶稣决意前往耶路撒冷时（路加福音9:51），他完全懂得自己将再一次被藐视和厌弃，并最终被处死。然而，他正是为此而生的。

#### Private Journey to Jerusalem （John 7:2-10） 私下前往耶路撒冷（约翰福音7:2-10）


Throughout his life many people had tried to force Jesus into doing what they wanted done. Mary, for example had asked Jesus to help at the wedding in Cana. The five thousand who had been fed by the fish and bread wanted to force Jesus to become their earthly king. Now again well-meaning people tried to tell the Almighty Savior what he should do. This time it was Jesus' own half-brothers （see Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3）。


纵观耶稣的一生，太多的人试图迫使耶稣按照他们想要的去做。比如马利亚在迦拿的婚宴上就曾请求耶稣的帮助。已经吃饱了饼和鱼的5000人，希望迫使耶稣成为他们世上的国王。如今，好心的人再次使徒告诉这位全能的救主，什么是他应该做的。这一次，他们是与耶稣亲如兄弟的人们。

The Feast of Tabernacles was about to take place. At this yearly event, held in October in A.D. 29, the Jews remembered the 40 years their ancestors had wandered in the wilderness living in tabernacles （tents）。 Like thousands of other Galilean pilgrims, Jesus' relatives were preparing for the trip to Jerusalem. They asked Christ to go along and do some miracles in the big city. Like so many others, they believed Jesus could be a Messiah who could lead Israel to political independence. But they failed to accept him as the deliverer from sin, eternal death, and the power of Satan.

住棚节即将要开始了。发生在公元29年十月份的这个年度的事件中，犹太人纪念他们的先祖40年在旷野徘徊，住在帐篷里。像成千上万的加利利朝圣者们一样，耶稣的亲戚们也准备好前往耶路撒冷。他们请基督一同前往，并在那个大城市里施展些神迹奇事。像其他很多人一样，他们相信耶稣可能就是弥赛亚，那个能够带领以色列在政治上独立的人。但是他们并未认同他就是那位将他们从罪、永远的死亡和撒旦的权势下拯救出来的人。

Jesus did not go with them. But, once they had left, he and his disciples did go on to Jerusalem by themselves. In April of the next year Jesus would make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. That was the right time according to his timetable.

耶稣没有跟他们同行。但是，当他们离开后，耶稣和他的门徒们也出发独自前往耶路撒冷。在第二年的四月份，耶稣将要荣耀地进入圣城。那才是他时间表中的完美时刻。

#### Jesus at the Feast of Tabernacles （John 7: 11-52） 耶稣在住棚节中（约翰福音7:11-52）

Was Jesus of Nazareth the Messiah or not? This question was discussed by many Jews at the Feast of the Tabernacles. So they kept looking for him, hoping he would show himself （John 7:11-13）。

拿撒勒的耶稣是不是弥赛亚呢？在住棚节期间，这个问题被很多犹太人们谈论着。所以他们一直在找他，希望他能够自己说明这点（约翰福音7:11-13）。

Then one day, halfway through the Feast, Jesus came to the temple and began to teach. As he spoke the people became confused. Jesus was from a poor family, yet he spoke as if he was highly educated. He said he spoke the words of God, his Father. This wonderful teacher said that his life was in danger, but no one came forward to argue with him or arrest him. Some people felt the Messiah would appear out of nowhere; others thought the Savior would come from Bethlehem, yet everyone knew Jesus was from Nazareth. Finally, he said that he would soon leave and they could not come along or even find him. A few days later He even claimed to be the source of salvation.

随后在节日过半的时候，一天耶稣来到圣殿中并开始教导。当他说话的时候，人们心里变得疑惑。耶稣来自一个穷苦的家庭，然而他说话像是接受了高等的教育。他说这些是来自与他的天父——上帝的话语。这奇妙的教导宣称耶稣的生命正面临着危险，但是没有人站出来与他争论或抓捕他。一些人觉得没有人知道弥赛亚从哪里来；另一些人认为救主应该出自伯利恒，然而所有人都知道耶稣是拿撒勒人。最后，耶稣说他将马上离开，人们不能与他同行，也无法找到他。一些天之后，他甚至宣称将成为救恩的泉源。

The crowd was divided. Was Jesus a prophet or the Savior? Should He live or die? Even the temple guards sent to arrest him became confused.

人群散开了。耶稣是一个先知，还是救世主呢？他该或者还是死去呢？甚至连派去抓捕耶稣的守卫也变得迷惑了。

#### The Woman Caught in Adultery （John 8:1-11） 犯奸淫的妇女（约翰福音8:1-11）

The day after the Feast ended, Jesus came to the temple courtyard. There the Jewish leaders tried to trap him. A woman caught in the act of adultery was brought before him. The Jews wondered whether or not he would forgive her sins, since the Law of Moses said this sin should be punished by stoning the sinner to death （Deut 22:24; Lev. 20:10）。 The Lord answered with a single sentence-“If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her” （John 8:7; see Deut. 17:7）。

节日结束后，耶稣来到圣殿的外院。犹太的领袖们在那里使徒陷害他。一个犯了淫乱被抓到的妇女被带到耶稣面前。犹太人想知道耶稣是否会赦免她的罪，因为摩西的律法中说，惩罚这样的罪时应该用石头将罪人打死（申命记22:24;利未记20:10）。主用一句话作为回答：“你们中间谁是没有罪的，谁就可以先拿石头打她。”（约翰福音8:7;参见申命记17:7）。

#### Jesus Addresses the Crowd （John 8:12-59） 耶稣对众人的演讲（约翰福音8:12-59）

Jesus had come to the temple to speak, and he did just that. Predictably, He then discussed （John 8） many of the points he made earlier （John 7）。 He spoke of his authority which came from his position as God the Father's Son, of the plot against his life, of his return to heaven, and of his claim to be the source of salvation. If Jesus were to be put to death it would not be an accident or the result of a misunderstanding. Jesus was to be judged on his claim to be the eternal Son of the Father （John 8:58）， the Messiah, the Savior of the world. The verdict reached by the Jews was that he should be stoned. However, Jesus was not yet ready to sacrifice his life.

耶稣已经来到圣殿教导，他确实做到了。不出所料，他随即讨论了（约翰福音8）很多此前提到的看法（约翰福音7）。他谈到了作为上帝的儿子而具有的权柄，谈到了害他性命的阴谋，谈到了他要回到天堂，还谈到他宣称自己是救恩的源泉。如果耶稣被杀死，那不是一个意外或者误会的结果。因为他声称自己是天父不朽的儿子、弥赛亚和救世主，他将要被审判。犹太人得出的结论是他应该被石头打死。然而，耶稣还没预备好将自己作为祭物献上。

#### The Man Born Blind Healed （John 9:1-41） 生来瞎眼的人被医治（约翰福音9:1-41）

In the New Testament Jesus is sometimes called the “light.” Isaiah the prophet looking forward to Christ said “The people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned” （Isaiah 9:2）。 Simeon holding the baby Jesus in his arms knew that Jesus would be “a light … to the Gentiles” （Luke 2:32）。 The evangelist John （1:4） spoke about the Savior as “the light of men.” Finally, Jesus, himself as he addressed the Jews at the Feast of Tabernacles exclaimed, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” （John 8:12）。


在新约中，耶稣有时被称为“光”.先知以赛亚盼望基督的时候说：“在黑暗中行走的百姓，看见了大光。住在死荫之地的人，有光照耀他们。”（以赛亚书9:2）。西面怀抱着小耶稣的时候，他知道这个婴儿将成为“照亮外邦人的光”（路加福音2:32）。使徒约翰（约翰福音1:4）说到耶稣是称其为“人的光”.最后，在耶稣向犹太人演讲时，他自己大声宣告说：“我是世界的光，跟从我的，就不在黑暗里走，必要得着生命的光。”（约翰福音8:12）。

Now, after being rejected by the Jews and barely escaping from them, Jesus came upon a man who was blind from his birth. The twelve disciples did not think about the man's personal misery. Instead they asked Jesus why he had this handicap. The disciples, like many people, believed that a person got sick or had problems because he had committed some big sin. Jesus corrected this false idea and directed them away from the cause to the cure.

现在，被犹太人决绝并逃离他们之后，耶稣遇见一个生来就瞎眼的人。十二个门徒并没有考虑到他个人的苦难。反而，他们问耶稣这个人为什么有这样的残缺。门徒们像很多人一样，相信一个人生病或者遇到麻烦，是因为他犯了大罪。耶稣更正了他们的错误想法，并使他们不再关注瞎眼的缘由，而关注耶稣的医治。

The Lord used this blind man to talk about his earlier teaching. Just as he brought physical light （sight） to the dark world of the blind man, so Jesus brings spiritual light to souls in the darkness of sin.

主藉着这个瞎眼的人来谈论他早前的教导。就像是他给这个瞎眼的人漆黑的世界带来光亮（视力）一样，耶稣也给那些在罪之黑暗中的灵魂带来属灵的光明。

Once again, however, hatred blinded the Pharisees to the point that they refused to see the Light of the world. They now tried to get the man Jesus healed to turn against him. But his new eyesight had let in true spiritual vision.

然而，敌意再一次使法利赛人看不见这一点，他们拒绝看见世界的光。现在他们试图让被医治的那人反过来抵挡耶稣。但痊愈的眼睛已经让他进入了真正属灵的视野。

#### The Good Shepherd （John 10:1-21） 好牧者（约翰福音10:1-21）

The events which followed the healing of the blind man filled Jesus' heart with grief. The religious leaders of the Jews could not care for the people of God. They had already spoken threats against those who said that Jesus was the Christ （John 9:22）。 And they followed through by evilly treating the case of the former blind man （9:34）。 Turning to the Pharisees, the disciples, the blind man, and all who could hear, Jesus spoke of shepherds and sheep （pictures that hearers of the Old Testament could easily understand, Ps. 23; Is. 40:11; Ezek. 34）。


医治了瞎子后发生的事情使耶稣心中充满了忧伤。犹太的宗教领袖不能照顾上帝的子民。他们早已威胁国那些口称耶稣是基督的人了（约翰福音9:22）。并且他们纠缠不休，恶毒地了解了此前那个瞎子的事情。耶稣转向法利赛人、门徒们、瞎子和素有能能听到的人们，谈论起牧者和羊群的教导（描绘出旧约的听众容易理解的场景，诗篇23;以赛亚书40:11;以西结书34）。

First Christ showed he was different than the false leaders. They were false shepherds; they were only hired to care for the sheep; they didn't really care about them, but ran away when danger came. But Jesus was a Good Shepherd. He knows his sheep, loves them, and is willing to give his own life to protect them.

首先，基督表明他与那些假的领袖不同。他们是假牧者；他们只是雇佣来照顾羊群的；他们不是真心地关心羊，当危险来临时就跑掉了。但是耶稣是一个好牧者。他知道他的羊，爱他们，愿意为了保护他们而舍弃自己的性命。

Then Christ described his relationship to believers. Believers listened to their shepherd's voice. They followed their shepherd and thus remained safe. Jesus knew his sheep. He offered them eternal life, and no one could take the sheep away from him.

随后，基督描绘了他与信徒们的关系。信徒们听他们牧者的声音。他们跟随自己的牧者，并且因此常保平安。耶稣知道他的羊群。他给他们永生，并且每人能将这些羊从他的手中夺去。

Jesus also spoke of calling others （the Gentiles） to himself. He explained that he was the only way to salvation. This Jesus would earn for all men through his willing sacrifice on Calvary's cross.

耶稣也谈到呼召其他人（外邦人）归向他。他解释说，他是唯一得救赎的途径。这位按着耶稣的意愿，他将要在髑髅地的十字架上被献为祭物，并以此赢得所有的人。

This speech of Jesus is a New Testament version of the 23rd Psalm. Some of the Jews were stirred to faith when they heard it. Others said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?” （John 10:20）。

耶稣的这席话是诗篇23篇的新约版本。一些犹太人听到这话时就心动相信了。另外一些人说：“他是被鬼附着，而且疯了，为什么听他呢？”（约翰福音10:20）。

#### Journey Into Samaria （Luke 9:51-62） 在撒马利亚里的行程（路加福音9:51-62）

After the Feast of the Tabernacles was over, Jesus and the disciples returned to Galilee. Soon, however, he set out for Jerusalem once again （Luke 9:51）。 This time he knew he was on his way to suffer and die for the sins of all mankind. This time Jesus decided to travel through Samaria, not around it.

住棚节结束后。耶稣和门徒们返回加利利。然而没过多久，他再次启程前往耶路撒冷（路加福音9:51）。这一次他知道他将走上这条为所有人的罪受苦和死亡的路。这一次耶稣决定要穿过撒马利亚地区，而不是绕过她。

With a group of up to 100 people Jesus came near a Samaritan village. The villagers refused to give hospitality to Jesus because he was going to Jerusalem. They felt their own Mt. Gerizim was the holy place for worship. James and John thought that Jesus should call down fire from heaven to destroy the village （2 Kings 1:10-12）。 The Samaritans refused to receive the One who was to be worshiped, and the disciples forgot that Jesus' mission was to save, not destroy souls （Luke 9:55）。

将近100个人跟随着耶稣来到了撒马利亚的一个村庄附近。因为他们要去耶路撒冷，村民们拒绝热情地款待耶稣。他们觉得自己的基列心山是敬拜的圣地。雅各和约翰认为耶稣应该叫火从天上下来消灭整个村庄（列王记下1:10-12）。撒马利亚人拒绝接受一个将被人们敬拜的人，同时门徒们忘了耶稣的的使命不是消灭灵魂，而是拯救他们（路加福音9:55）。

#### Jesus and the Seventy Missionaries （Luke 10: 1-24） 耶稣和七十个宣教士（路加福音10:1-24）

The unfriendly Samaritans did not stop Jesus from his mission or cool his love for sinful mankind. Soon he sent 70 disciples on a preaching tour. The instructions they received were similar to those given the Twelve Apostles earlier （see Chapter 6）.


这些不友好的撒玛利亚人并没有让耶稣停止他的使命，或让他对罪人的爱冷淡下来。很快耶稣差派70个门徒开始他们的宣教旅程。耶稣给他们的教导与此前他给十二使徒的如出一辙（参见第六章）。

There were several reasons for sending out the disciples at this particular time. First, just as Jesus had sent two disciples on ahead into the Samaritan village to announce his coming, so the 70 would go into areas where he was not well known （Perea, Judea） and prepare for his arrival. Second, Jesus knew he did not have many more days on earth. Others would have to continue his work. This preaching tour would serve as on-the-job training for such ministers.

在这个特别的时期，有好几个原因将这些门徒差派出去。首先，就像耶稣差派了两个门徒，在他们之前进入撒玛利亚的村庄，去宣告耶稣的到来一样；这70个人将进入那些对耶稣不甚了解的区域（庇哩亚，犹大），并预备好耶稣的到来。其次，耶稣知道他在世的时候不多了。其他人将要继续他的工作。这次宣教之旅将通过实践来训练这些宣教士们。

The results of the preaching tour were great. The message of Jesus struck hard at Satan. Then Christ said a prayer like one of his earlier ones （cf. Matt. 11:25-27）。

宣教之旅的结果是美好的。耶稣的信息沉重地打击了撒旦。随后，基督向他此前一样，献上了一个祷告（参看马太福音11:25-27）。 　　　

#### Parable of the Good Samaritan （Luke 10:25-37） 好撒马利亚人的比喻（路加福音10:25-37）

The next several events recorded by St. Luke （10:25-13:21） cannot be put into exact order. However, we will follow the order given in Luke's Gospel.


我们无法准确地知道圣路加接下来所记载的一些事件发生的顺序。不管怎样，我们可以遵循路加福音中记载的顺序。

The parable of the Good Samaritan is one of the best known in all of Scripture. Today people who help others are often called Good Samaritans. Hospitals are often given this name. Most people think this parable teaches us that God wants us to help our fellow human beings.

好撒马利亚人的比喻是圣经中最著名的故事之一。今天那些帮助了其他人的人常被称作好撒马利亚人。医院经常以此命名。很多人认为这个比喻教导我们，上帝希望我们帮助我们的同路人。

However, the parable was spoken to answer a question about salvation not about being a good neighbor. An expert in the law came to Jesus asking “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked the man what he thought. The expert then quoted Deut. 6:4-5 and Lev. 19:18 （words which were said every morning and evening by religious Jews）。 When Jesus told the man to obey those commands, the man asked who his neighbor was. Jesus then told the man this parable. It did not answer the question “Who is my neighbor?” but “Whose neighbor am I?” If the expert in the law had taken this parable to heart he would have confessed his own sinfulness and would have admitted his need of a Savior.

然而，这个比喻是在回答一个关于救赎的问题，而不是关于做一个好的邻舍。一个旅法师来见耶稣说：“我该做什么才可以承受永生？”耶稣问这个人他的想法。律法师引用了申命记6:4-5和利未记19:18节的经文（犹太教徒每个早晨和晚上所说的话）。当耶稣告诉这个人要遵守这些命令时，他又问“谁是我的邻舍呢？”随后，耶稣给他讲了这个比喻。这个比喻没有回答“谁是我的邻舍呢？”这个问题。但是回答了“我是谁的邻舍呢？”如果这个律法师将这个比喻放在心中，他定会认自己的罪，并且承认他需要一个救主。

#### Jesus with Mary and Martha （Luke 10:38-42） 耶稣和马大、马利亚（路加福音10:38-42）

Jesus traveled into Judea to a town called Bethany. There he stayed at the home of Martha and Mary （about whom we will learn more in later chapters）。 Martha was full of energy. She wanted to be a perfect hostess to Jesus. Mary sat and listened to Jesus speak. She was the wiser. Christ praised Mary for choosing the one thing she really needed. After all, “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” （Matt. 20:28）。


耶稣来到了犹大一个叫伯大尼的小城。他住在马大喝马利亚（在随后的章节中我们还会了解更多关于她的事情）的家中。马大是一个精力十足的人。她想完美地招待耶稣。马利亚坐在那里，听耶稣讲道。她是聪明的。基督夸奖了马利亚，因为她选择了真正需要的。毕竟“人子来不是要受人的服侍，而是要服侍人”（马太福音20:28）。

#### The Disciples Taught How to Pray （Luke 11:1-13） 教导门徒如何祷告（路加福音11:1-13）

0ne day after Jesus had finished praying a disciple asked, “Lord, teach us to pray” （Luke 11:1）。 Jesus did just that. He taught them to whom they should pray – God in heaven; for what they should pray – spiritual and bodily needs; how they should pray – without stopping; and what to expect from prayer – an answer from a loving God. As students of the Master, all Christians should learn this lesson well.



一天，当耶稣结束了祷告后，一个门徒问他：“求主教导我们祷告”（路加福音11:1）。耶稣就教导他们。他告诉他们祷告的对象应该是——天上的父；教导他们该祷告什么——灵魂和身体的需要；他们该如何祷告——不停地；以及在祷告中期待什么——一个充满爱的上帝给出的答案。作为主的学生，每一个基督徒都应学好这一课。

####　Condemning the Pharisees and Lawyers （Luke 11:37-54） 定法利赛人和律法师的罪（路加福音11:37-54）

Today it is popular to think that Jesus was a gentle person. Many people cannot believe Jesus could be as harsh as his words in Luke 11:37-54. But we must simply accept the simple words of Scripture. Jesus' love was great even for the Pharisees and lawyers. He struck fear in their hearts with these strong words. He tried to wake them up from their false beliefs. Thus Jesus accused the Pharisees of just going through the actions of religion, of doing good outwardly while inside their souls were spiritually dead. The experts of religious law were even worse. They were not only fooling themselves; they were taking others to hell with them.



今天流行的想法是，耶稣是一个很好的人。很多人不相信耶稣会像路加福音11:37-54节中，说那么严厉的话。但是我们必须单纯地理解圣经上简单的话语。对于法利赛人和律法师，耶稣的爱一样是极大的。通过这些强有力的话语，耶稣击打着他们心中的恐惧。他试图将他们从错误的信仰中唤醒。因此耶稣职责法利赛人，批评他们只关心宗教的行为，批评他们表面做的好，但他们里面的灵已经死了。律法师甚至更糟糕。他们不只使自己愚拙；还拉上别人一同下地狱。

Jesus' warnings did not lead to the result he wished. Instead, the Pharisees and lawyers continued to ask him questions hoping he would say something wrong so they could attack him.

耶稣的警告没有达到预期的效果。与之相反，法利赛人和律法师继续问他问题，希望抓到他话中的把柄，然后他们就可以攻击耶稣。

#### Discussion with Disciples and Others （Luke 12:1-59）　与门徒和其他人的讨论（路加福音12:1-59）

Jesus now turned to his disciples, warned them against the Pharisees' teaching, and encouraged them in their defense of the Gospel. It should not surprise us that he repeated statements He had made earlier. After all good teachers often repeated their main points.


耶稣现在转向他的门徒们，警告他们防备法利赛人的教导，并激励他们为福音辩护。不出所料，耶稣重复了他此前的宣告。毕竟所有好的老师都经常重复他们认为重要的见解。

While Jesus was speaking to the disciples a crowd gathered to see the man who had been so bold as to argue with the Pharisees. Then someone in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me' “ （Luke 12:13）。

当耶稣对门徒说话的时候，一群人聚集而来，要看看这个敢于和法利赛人争论的人。随后，人群中的一些人问耶稣：”夫子，请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。“（路加福音12:13）。

This person was not interested in Jesus' message of joy, peace, and pardon; he was only interested in his own financial affairs. Jesus answered, ”Man, who appointed me to be a judge between you?“ （Luke 12:14）。 Jesus refused to consider his case. He was saying that the spiritual and earthly kingdoms are and must be kept separate. Fifteen centuries later the leaders of the Lutheran church wrote:

这个人对耶稣喜乐、平安和赦免的信息不感兴趣；他只关心他自己的财产问题。耶稣回答说：”你这个人，谁立我做你们断事的官呢？“（路加福音12:14）。耶稣拒绝考虑他的问题。他教导说属灵的国度和地上的过国度是分开的，并且一定不要混为一谈。十五个世纪之后，路德宗教会的领袖们写道：

”Therefore, church and government are not to be mixed up. The power of the church has its own mission to preach the Gospel and offer the sacraments. It should not interfere in the job of the government, nor help appoint rulers in the world, nor set aside government laws, nor stop people from obeying the law, nor interfere with decisions about any government laws or agreements, nor insist to government rulers which laws should be set up to regulate the form of government. For Christ says, “My kingdom is not of this world,” and again, “Who made me a judge over you?”

“然而，教会和政府不要混淆不清。教会的能力有他自己的使命，就是传讲福音并施行圣礼。教会不应该干涉政府的工作；不能帮助任命世上的官员；不应拒绝政府的法律；不能阻止人们遵纪守法；不干涉任何关于政府法律和条约的决定；也不坚持要求政府的官员们，应该设立某一条法律来治理政体。因为基督说：‘我的国不在这地上’以及‘谁让我为你们断事呢？'

This question of the man in the crowd made Jesus so concerned that he began to discuss attitudes toward earthly possessions. In the parable of the rich fool he warned against selfishness and greed. Turning to the disciples he taught them not to worry. The two sins are cousins. ”Greed can never get enough, worry is afraid it might not have enough.“”

这个人群中某人的问题，让耶稣如此关注，以致他开始讨论对于世上财富的态度。在富有的傻瓜的比喻里，他警告那些自私和贪婪的人。对与他的门徒们，耶稣则教导他们不要忧虑。这两个罪是表兄弟’贪婪永不满足，忧虑则担心拥有可能不足够。‘“

The man of God must always be prepared for Christ's Second Coming as Jesus himself taught. He must not become wrapped up in earthly matters. Before that coming, however, difficult trials will happen to people. The cross divides mankind. Disciples who are faithful, unlike others, respond to these warning signs.

如耶稣自己教导的那样，上帝的子民必须常常准备好迎接基督的第二次降临。他一定不再纠缠于那些世俗之事。然而，他来之前，艰难的考验会临到人们身上。十字架使人类被分别开来。那些忠实的门徒们和其他人不同，他们对这些警告的信号有所回应。

#### Final Call to Repentance （Luke 13:1-9） 悔改的最后呼召（路加福音13:1-9）

Jesus' warnings about judgment day started the crowd thinking. Remember that Jews often thought disasters were God's punishment for particular sins. Therefore, they decided that this was the right time to discuss the matter of a recent temple tragedy. Roman soldiers had killed some Galileans who had been offering sacrifices. Jesus noted that this and another tragic event where punishments on individual sins. Rather, they were signs meant to warn of God's coming judgment on all those who had not repented. To make this point Jesus spoke a parable about a fig tree that produced no fruit.

耶稣关于审判日的警告开始于人群的思考。还记得吗？犹太人常常认为灾难都是上帝对特别之罪的惩罚。所以，他们决定这正是绝佳的时机，来讨论一件最近发生在圣殿中的悲剧。罗马士兵杀害了一些献祭的加利利人。耶稣提到此事，也提到另一件惩罚个别犯罪的不幸事件。当然，这些信号都是对那些还没有悔改的人，发出上帝那即将审判的警告。为了表明这点，耶稣说了一个无花果树不产果子的比喻。

#### Healing of a Woman on the Sabbath （Luke 13:10-21） 安息日医治一名妇女（路加福音13:10-21）

Were the Pharisees troubled by the ”woes“ Jesus pronounced against them? Did his warning about Judgment Day produce repentance?

法利赛人被耶稣向他们所宣告”祸“所困扰吗？耶稣关于审判日的警告使他们悔改了吗？

One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a Gideon synagogue. There he healed a woman who for 18 years had been inflicted by a demon. Some Jews condemned him for healing on the Sabbath. But, by comparing a Jewish girl to a donkey, Jesus shamed those Jews and delighted many people.

一个安息日里，耶稣正在基甸的会堂中教导。在那里他医治了一名被鬼附了18年的妇女。一些犹太人因为耶稣在安息日里治病而定他的罪。但是，通过对比一个犹太女孩和一头驴，耶稣羞辱了那些犹太人，并让很多人感到痛快。

The sight of people rejoicing, encouraged Jesus. Though small now （like a mustard seed） the Kingdom of God would expand greatly. Like yeast the Kingdom would be a silent yet powerful force.

看到人们的信息，耶稣很受鼓舞。尽管上帝的国度现在很小（像芥菜种一样），但她将会极大地扩展。像酵母一样，这个国度会成为一股安静但是强有力的能量。
