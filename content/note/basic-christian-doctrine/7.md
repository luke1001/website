第五课 (LESSON #5) 信心的增长: 上帝接纳我进入主家庭---圣洗礼
alt
GOD’S GRACE GIVEN TO US THROUGH BAPTISM
通过受洗，上帝把恩典赐予我们alt
So far, we have learned that no one can believe on his own. Only God can make us alive in Christ (Ephesians 2:1-10). God, the Holy Spirit, makes us alive by giving us his grace.
到现在为止，我们知道，没有人能够仅仅靠自己而相信。只有上帝可以使我们在基督里活过来。（以弗所书 2章1---10节）因上帝，圣灵赐给我们的恩典，我们得以活过来。
Consider the story of the gospel where Jesus raised his good friend Lazarus from the dead (John 11).  As we learn about God’s miraculous power in Baptism, I pray that you see nothing short of a miracle, not much unlike the one that took place with Lazarus when Jesus raised him from the dead.  The Bible teaches us that God brings spiritually dead people to life through the regenerating waters of Holy Baptism.  
想想福音书里，耶稣使他的好朋友拉撒路从死里复活的故事。（约翰福音11章）当我们了解上帝在洗礼中彰显的大能时，我求主使你不要轻看这个神迹，就像发生在拉撒路身上耶稣使他从死里复活的神迹一样。圣经教导我们，上帝用圣洗礼中新生圣水使人从灵里的死亡活过来。
When Jesus came and told the world of God’s grace he also instituted two special church acts which would give his people concrete assurance of the forgiveness of sins.  They are Baptism and the Lord’s Supper.  We call these two sacred acts Sacraments.
当耶稣到来并告诉这个世界上帝的恩典时，他也设立了两个特别的教会圣工，从而给他的子民他们的罪得宽恕的具体保证。即圣洗礼和圣餐。我们把这两个圣工称作圣礼。

A SACRAMENT is . . .
 一个圣礼是。。。。。
a sacred act…
一个圣工。。。。
alt
1. instituted by Christ (Matthew 28:18-20)
由基督设立（马太福音28:18-20）
2. with certain visible elements connected with God’s Word (Baptizw = “to wash, or apply water)
用某种与上帝的话语有联系的可见的元素。（受洗意思是，清洗，或使用水）
3. by which God gives forgiveness, new life, and salvation (Titus 3:5)
借此，上帝给予宽恕，新生和救赎。（提多书3：5）
God gives us forgiveness of our sins through his word, when it is preached and when it is attached to these two sacraments.  God gives us his grace through Word and Sacrament.  Therefore, we call these his “Means of Grace.”  Think of how the farmer uses tools to till his ground.  So too, God uses tools of the gospel, the Word and the Sacraments to create and sustain faith in the hearts of his children.
alt
当宣讲上帝的话语，当他的话与圣礼相联系时，通过他的话，上帝给我们他对罪的宽恕。上帝通过话语和圣礼赐予我们恩典。因此，我们称圣礼为神的恩典之道 。想想农民如何用工具 耕地，同样，上帝把福音，话语，圣礼当做工具，在他的儿女的心里创造和持守信心。

Note:  We must keep in mind that baptism is a work of God and not of man.  Otherwise we stand to lose all the joy and comfort God wants us to get from our Baptism.
注意：我们必须记住，洗礼是上帝的工作，不是人类自己完成的。
否则，我们就会失去上帝要我们从洗礼里得到的所有的喜乐和平安。
Where in the Bible does Christ command Baptism?
圣经的什么地方耶稣命令受洗？
Matthew 28:18-20 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
（马太福音28:18-20）耶稣进前来，对他们说，“天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了，所以你们要去，使万民做我的门徒，奉父，子，圣灵的名给他们施洗。凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”

Here Jesus says that our mission is to make disciples of all nations.  In the original Greek, baptizing and teaching are means by which people are “made disciples.”  God’s grace comes through the Word preached and through the promise of forgiveness attached to Baptism.
这里耶稣说到，我们的使命是使万民做上帝的门徒。在原希腊文里，施洗和教导是人类成为门徒的方式。上帝的恩典的到来是通过宣讲他的话语，通过依附于洗礼的宽恕罪的应许。

Where in the Bible does it say that in Baptism God saves sinners?
圣经哪里提到，上帝在洗礼里拯救罪人？
 I Peter 3:18-22 For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, 19through whom[d] also he went and preached to the spirits in prison 20who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
彼得前书：因基督也曾一次为罪受苦，就是义的代替不义的，为要引我们到神面前。按着肉体说，他被治死，按着灵性说，他复活了。他借这灵曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听，就是那从前在诺亚预备方舟，神容忍等待的时候，不信从的人。当时进入方舟，借着水得救的不多，只有八个人。这水所表明的洗礼，现在借着耶稣基督复活也拯救你们，这洗礼本不在乎除掉肉体的污秽，只求在神面前有无亏的良心。耶稣已经进入天堂，在神的右边，众天使和有权柄的，并有能力的，都服从了他。
• In this inspired letter of the Apostle Peter, God affirms that he saves us from our sins through Baptism.  Baptism guarantees us salvation and a clear conscience before God through Christ’s death and resurrection.
在这封使徒彼得经圣灵默示的书信里，上帝证实通过洗礼他把我们从罪里拯救。通过基督的死亡和复活，洗礼保证我们得救赎，和在上帝面前坦然无惧（原文是清楚明白的意思或有颗清楚的良心）。
Acts 2:38-39 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.  And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.
 使徒行传 2：38-39：彼得说：“你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，
就必领受所赐的圣灵。因为这应许是给你们和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们神所召来的。“
• Peter promises the repentant Jews that they will receive forgiveness through Baptism.
彼得向忏悔的犹太人承诺，他们将通过洗礼里得到神的宽恕。
 Note: There are no New Testament references to Baptism where Baptism does not impart some spiritual blessing.  Every blessing is shown to be springing from God’s grace through Baptism.
注意：新约圣经里没有提到施洗不会给予灵性祝福。 事实上,每一个灵里的祝福都显示了来自于籍着洗礼而来的上帝的恩典alt
List the following blessing offered or given in Holy Baptism…
列举以下在神圣的洗礼中得到的赐福。
Titus 3:5 … he (God our Savior) saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.  He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
提多书3:5:他便救了我们：并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，借着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。

Galatians 3:26 You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
迦拉太书3：26 所以，你们因信基督耶稣都是神的儿子， 你们受洗归入基督的，都是披戴基督了。

I Corinthians 12:12 The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body.  So it is with Christ.  For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body…
哥林多前书 12：12 就如身子是一个，却有许多肢体；而且肢体
虽多，仍是一个身子；基督也是这样。我们都从一个圣灵受洗，
成为一个身体。


Blessing赐福:-----------------------alt

Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
以弗所书 5：25 你们做丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。要用水借着道，把教会洗净，成为圣洁，可以献给自己，做个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污，皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。



Blessing赐福:-----------------------alt
Romans 6:4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.  Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life;
罗马书 6：4
所以，我们借着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动 有新生的样式，像基督借着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。所以，不要 容罪在你们必死的身上做王，使你们顺从身子的私欲。也不要将你们的肢体 献给罪，做不义的器具，倒要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神，并将肢体做义的器具献给神。

Blessing赐福:-----------------------
Martin Luther said: The world is now so full of sects clamoring that Baptism is an external thing, and that external things are of no benefit. But God's Word and command institute, establish, and confirm Baptism.
马丁路德说：“世界现在充满了喧闹的教派，认为洗礼是外在的东西。外在的东西没有任何益处。
但是，上帝的话和命令制定，建立，确定洗礼。
Analyze this statement:  “Infant baptism is rejected, because only an adult can consciously perform an act of obedience,” as a Baptist confession of 1688 puts it; “in order to be baptized one must actually profess repentance towards God, faith in and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ.”  Since children cannot do this, they therefore are not to be admitted to baptism.
分析这一陈述：“禁止婴儿受洗，因为只有成人能有意识地表现服从的行为，”,一个 1688年浸信会的信条说；“为了受洗，人必须真实地向上帝表示忏悔，对主耶稣基督的信心和服从。”既然儿童不能做到这个，他们因此不能被允许接受洗礼。
Is this really consistent with what the Bible says?
这是否真的和圣经一致？
Read the following passages from the Old Testament and answer the questions:
阅读以下旧约经文的章节，回答问题：alt
Genesis 17:10-14
10 This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.  11 You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.  12 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.  13 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.  14 Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
创世纪17:10-14 你和你的后裔必世世代代遵守我的约。你们所有的男子都要受割礼，这就是我与你并你的后裔所立的约，是你们所当遵守的。你们都要受割礼，这是我与你们立约的证据。你们世世代代的男子，无论是家里生的，是在你后裔之外用银子从外人买的，生下来第八日，都要受割礼。你家里生的和你 用银子买的， 都必须受割礼。这样，我的约就立在你们肉体上，做永远的约。但不受割礼的男子必从民中剪除，因他背了我的约。
1. When did a male child officially come into covenant with God?
男孩什么时候正式和上帝立约？
2. Who was cut off from God if the child was not circumcised: the parents or the child?
如果孩子不受割礼，谁会从民中剪除，父母还是孩子？alt
Exodus 12:48 “An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.
出埃及记12：48 若有外人寄居在你们
中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的
男子务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，
他也就像本地人一样，但未受割礼的，
都不可吃这羊羔。
3. What do you think? Should someone who has not yet received a Christian baptism receive the sacrament of Holy Communion?  Why or why not?
. 你怎么看？还没有接受基督教洗礼的人可以领受圣餐吗？说明理由。
Exodus 4:24-26  At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met {Moses}  and was about to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched {Moses'} feet with it. [c] "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said. 26 So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)alt
出埃及记4:24-26 摩西在路上住宿的地方，耶和华遇见他，
想要杀他。西坡拉 就拿一块火石，割下他儿子的阳皮，丢在摩西脚前说，
你真是我的血郎了。这样，耶和华才放了他。西坡拉说，你因割礼就是血郎了。
4. What do you think? In the days of Israel when God made a promise of grace by which a child might enter into a relationship with him (circumcision) it didn’t really matter to God when you did the circumcision, but rather that you just get it done at some point in time.
   你怎么认为？在以色列年代，当上帝和以色列人立下恩典的应许（割礼），男孩可以与上帝建立联系。什么时候行割礼对上帝不是紧要的，只要你在某个时候做了就好。

Deuteronomy 10:16, 30:6;
16 Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.alt
6 The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.
申命记10:16, 30:6;
所以你们要将心里的污秽除掉，不要再硬着颈项。
耶和华你神必将你心里和你后裔心里的污秽除掉，好叫你尽心尽性爱耶和华你的神，
使你可以存活。
5.  How do these two verses teach us that circumcision was more than just an external act?
    . 这两个经文如何教导我们行割礼不只是外在的行为？
Listen how St. Paul parallels circumcision with the New Testament covenant called Baptism:
请看保罗是如何把割礼和新约中称为洗礼立的新约做对比。
。alt
Colossians 2:9-12 For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.  In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
歌罗西书2：9-12因為神本性一切的豐盛都有形有體的居住在基督裡面，  你們在他裡面也得了豐盛。他是各樣執政掌權者的元首。你們在他裡面也受了不是人手所行的割禮，乃是基督使你們脫去肉體情慾的割禮。你們既受洗與他一同埋葬，也就在此與他一同復活，都因信那叫他從死裡復活神的功用。

• Is there any danger to withhold baptism from a baby, according to the Bible?  The answer is yes!  You are endangering the child by withholding the blessings of baptism from a child that is born into this world, “Dead in trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1).  Also, the parents are also tempting God by despising this precious means of grace and withholding it from their child.
• 根据圣经，拒绝给婴孩洗礼有任何危险吗？回答是是！你阻止给降生到这个世界的婴孩得到洗礼的恩赐，使他陷于危险，“死在过犯罪恶中”（以弗所书2：1）。同样，父母轻视这珍贵的授予恩典的方法和阻止他们的孩子得到恩赐是在向神挑衅。

Is everyone who is baptized automatically saved?
人受洗后自动得救吗？
Mark 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.信而受洗的，必然得救，不信的，必被定罪。
• Whoever rejects the forgiveness that God offers in baptism refuses any chance for heaven.
• 人若拒绝神籍着圣洗礼所赐与的饶恕就是拒绝进入天国的机会.

Why does the Lutheran Church baptize infants?
  为什么路德宗教会为婴孩洗礼？
 Acts 2:38-39 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.  And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.
使徒行传2：38-39彼得說：你們各人要悔改，奉耶穌基督的名受洗，叫你們的罪得赦，就必領受所賜的聖靈；因為這應許是給你們和你們的兒女，並一切在遠方的人，就是主─我們神所召來的。
• For the same reason that the first believers had their children baptized.  Through baptism they were assured that God extended his grace also to their children.
• 因为同样的理由，最早的信徒给他们的孩子受洗。通过洗礼他们确信上帝将恩典延续到他们孩子身上。alt

Acts 16:33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.
使徒行传16：33当夜禁卒洗了他们的伤(被棍打出血了)，又立时都受了洗。同时，又领他们上自己的家，给他们摆上饭。他们全家因为信了主
• The burden of proof from these passages is on those who would want to exclude children, not include them.
• 从这节中证明责任在那些想把儿童排除在外，不为他们受洗的人身上。

Psalm 51:5 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
诗篇51：5我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎时就有了罪。
a. Our children are sinners from conception
a.   我们的孩子在母胎中就是罪人
Ezekiel 18:20 The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.
以西结书18：20  惟有犯罪的，他必死亡。儿子必不担当父亲的罪孽，父亲也不担当儿子的罪孽。义人的善果必归自己，恶人的恶报也必归自己。
b. Our children are accountable for their sinfulness
b.    我们的孩子当为他们的罪孽负责任。
1 Peter 3:18-22 (read earlier from the lesson)alt
彼得前书3：18-22（课前阅读）
c. God promises forgiveness through baptism
c. 通过洗礼上帝应许宽恕我们
Matthew 28:19 (read earlier from the lesson)
马太福音28：19（课前阅读）
d. God does not limit Baptism to any age group
d.  上帝对任何年龄的人不限制受洗。

e. Since the sacrament is gospel and God works faith through his gospel, we trust that he can cause our children to believe through this Sacrament.  The miracle of faith in children through Baptism is no more incredible than the miracle of faith in adults.  Conversion comes from God and the power of the gospel, not the decision of mankind to make a choice.
e. 既然圣礼是福音，并且上帝通过他的福音在信心里做工，我们相信他能通过圣礼使我们的孩子相信。通过受洗，信心的奇迹彰显在儿童身上和在成人身上是一样的。转化来自上帝和福音的大能。而不是人类作出的选择。

Luke 18:15-17 15People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. 16But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 17I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
路加福音18：15-17有人抱着自己的婴孩来见耶稣，要他摸他们；门徒看见就责备那些人。耶稣却叫他们来，说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在　神国的正是这样的人。我实在告诉你们：凡要承受　神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。”

II Timothy 3:15 And how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.  
提摩太后书3：15并且知道你是从小明白圣经。这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧。
f. God can work faith into the heart of little babies as well as adults.  The Greek word in these passages which are translated, “babies” or “infancy” are only used of unborn children or infants.  So when church bodies in the world insist that babies are too young to have faith, they aren’t learning that from the Word of God, but rather from their own sinful reason.
f    上帝能让信心象在成人心中一样在小婴孩心里做工。在这节里，希腊文翻译为宝宝或婴孩只用于未出世的孩子。所以当世上的教会坚持婴孩太小而没有信心，他们不是从学习上帝的话得到的，而是来自他们自已罪性的常理判断。

Why do some churches not baptize infants?
  为什么有些教会不给婴孩受洗？
• They view Baptism as a work of the individual. They call it an "outward sign of an inward change".  Since it is a work of the individual, only those who know about it and can ask for it will be baptized.  This is taught nowhere in Scripture and came into practice during the 1600's through the Anabaptists.
• 他们视洗礼为个人的工作。他们称之为“内在改变的外在表征。”既然它是个人的工作，只有了解它并要求它的人才被受洗。这不是圣经所教导的，是在到了17世纪通过再洗礼派教徒开始实行的。

Did the early church baptize infants?
早期教会给婴孩受洗吗？
Absolutely, because the early church held that baptism was a means which God used to apply grace to the individual. Consider the following:
当然，因为早期教会把洗礼作为上帝施恩典于人的一种方法。考虑下面几点：
• The church father, Origen, born 185 A.D., tells us the practice of baptizing children was handed down to them from the apostles.
• 教会领袖，奥利金，生于公元后185年，告诉我们对儿童施洗的习惯是从使徒们那传下来的。
• Irenaeus (202 A.D.), who was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of the Apostle John, wrote: "Christ came to save all men by himself; all, I say, who through him are reborn into God; infants, little children, boys, young men and old men."
爱任纽（公元后202），他是坡旅甲的门徒，而坡旅甲是使徒约翰的门徒，他写下：基督亲自到来拯救所有的人；所有的，我是说，通过他在上帝那再生的人；婴孩，儿童，男孩，年轻人和老年人。“
•
• The great Augustine, born 353 A.D., said he never heard of anyone who accepted the Bible as God's Word who also rejected infant baptism.
• 伟大的奥古斯丁，生于公元后353年，说过他从未听说任何人接受圣经作为神的话语却拒绝婴孩受洗。
Numerous inscriptions on the graves in the catacombs, dating back to the very first centuries of Christianity, testify to the fact that the early Christians baptized their children.  Here is one: “Aristus lived eight months.  He was recently baptized."
追溯到早期几个世纪的基督教，无数刻在地下墓穴的坟墓的碑文证明了早期基督徒为孩子受洗的事实。这有个例子：立德活了8个月。他最近受洗。“

Does it matter how much water is used in baptism?
洗礼时用多少水事关重要吗？

No! Scripture nowhere specifies an amount of water to be used.  On some of the catacombs dating as far back as 165 A.D., there are pictures of baptisms by pouring water over the head.  It is not the water that has the power but the Word of God applied with water in the name of the Triune God.
不！圣经里没有一处具体说明要用多少水。追溯到远至公元后165年，在一些地下墓穴，有些把水从头上浇下去的洗礼图画。不是水有大能而是因着奉三位一体神的圣名受洗的水而应用神的话语的大能。
Baptism is a wonderful gift from God.  How God works through baptism is no less mysterious than the Trinity itself.  He does not ask that we understand it, but only that we faithfully use this gift and enjoy its benefits throughout our entire lives.
洗礼是来自上帝的美好的礼物。上帝通过洗礼做工和三位一体一样神奇。他不是要求我们理解，而是要求在我们一生中，我们忠实地使用这个礼物，享受洗礼的各样祝福。
