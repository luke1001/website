第六课 (LESSON 6)主的晚餐的神圣设立和团契的圣经教导
alt
·    人类的理智肯定是来自神的礼物，却多年以来无疑亵渎了神关于他设立的最神圣的晚餐亵的清晰明确的话语。人类的理智关于为何神清晰的话不能是真的在世上造成各种障碍。当我们全面学习这一教义就像圣经清楚地显明给我们，让我们回到马丁路德曾说的“不是基督教需要被合理化，而是我们的理智需要有基督的理性。”
·   The words of institution are far too plain for human arguments: “This is my body, and this is my blood.” As we look at this study of God’s Word, we will plainly see that in this meal, Christ himself will be present with us in person. Since body and blood is what constitutes a person, so it is that we will see that Jesus merely promises that his person will be with us in that meal.
Matthew 26:17-30 17On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and altasked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?" 18He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.' " 19So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.  20When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. 21And while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."  22They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely not I, Lord?"  23Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. 24The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."  25Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you." 26While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my altbody."  27Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. 28This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."  30When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
马太福音26:17-30   17除酵节的第一天，门徒来问耶稣说：“你吃逾越节的筵席，要我们在哪里给你预备？”18耶稣说：“你们进城去，到某人那里，对他说，‘夫子说：我的时候快到了，我与门徒要在你家里守逾越节。’”19门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的，就去预备了逾越节的筵席。20到了晚上，耶稣和十二个门徒坐席。21正吃的时候，耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们：你们中间有一个人要卖我了。”22他们就甚忧愁，一个一个地问他说：“主，是我吗？”23耶稣回答说：“同我蘸手在盘子里的，就是他要卖我。24人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的，但卖人子的有祸了！那人不生在世上倒好。”25卖耶稣的犹大问他说：“拉比，是我吗？”耶稣说：“你说的是。”    26他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。”27又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：“你们都喝这个，28因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。29但我告诉你们：从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里同你们喝新的那日子。”30他们唱了诗，就出来往橄榄山去。

I Corinthians 10:16 16The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? (KJV)
哥林多前书10:16我們所祝福的杯，豈不是同領基督的血嗎﹖我們所擘開的餅，豈不是同領基督的身體嗎﹖

·   The King James Version was written in 1511 in old English. But notice how the word translated“communion” or “common union” captures the real presence of the Lord’s Supper. “The cup [or wine] is a common union with the blood of Christ,” and the bread is a common union with the body of Christ.” This is a very good translation of the Greek word that is used in this verse. A simple definition of the Lord’s Supper: It is the bread and wine connected with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and it grants to all who receive it by faith the remission of sins.
·   詹姆士国王译本是在1511年用古英语写的。但注意到“共同享有”一词或“共同为一体”抓住了主的圣餐的圣体实在的意义。“这杯（或葡萄酒）是和基督的血的同为一体，”这饼是和主的身体同为一体。”对这节里使用的希腊词翻译地很好。一个对于主的圣餐的简单定义是：它是和我们的主耶稣基督的身体和血相联系的饼和葡萄酒，它授予所有因着信心接受圣餐的人罪的赦免权。


Can Jesus truly be Present in the Sacrament?
 耶稣真的在圣餐仪式中与我们同在吗？

Matthew 18:20 “For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them”alt
马太福音18：20“因為無論在哪裏，有兩三個人奉我的名聚會，那裏就有我在他們中間。」

What article of faith do we confess about God in regards to this passage?
根据这一章节我们关于神的信仰的信条是什么？

So then, if God’s everywhere, what do you suppose it means that he’s with us when two or three are gathered together in his name?
那么，如果神无处不在，你认为当两三个人奉他的名聚会，他必与我们同在是什么意思？
Remember what the Old Testament civic Law said about corroboration of the accused? Between how many people did the testimony have to be established between?
 When Christians gather together in the name of Jesus altChrist, there Jesus is in an intimate way strengthening and encouraging us through the presence of his Word. Is he there with us? Absolutely! His Word says so and we know that he’s omnipresent.
记得旧约中民法关于被告的确证的事实吗？证词要由多少人做见证才能确定？
当基督徒奉耶稣基督之名聚会，耶稣通过他的话与我们同在亲密地加固和激励我们。他与我们同在吗？当然！圣经这样说的，我们知道他是无处不在的。

I Thessalonians 5:11
Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
帖撒罗尼迦前书5：11所 以 你 们 该 彼 此 劝 慰 ， 互 相 建 立 ， 正 如 你 们 素 常 所 行 的 。

Hebrews 10:25
Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
希伯来书10：25你 們 不 可 停 止 聚 會 、 好 像 那 些 停 止 慣 了 的 人 、 倒 要 彼 此 勸 勉 ． 既 知 道 〔 原 文 作 看 見 〕 那 日 子 臨 近 、 就 更 當 如 此 。

Didn’t Christ give his disciples and therefore us his own assurance that he would be present with us when he ascended into heaven? What did he say to his disciples after charging them to preach the gospel to all creation (to the whole world)?
难道基督没给他的门徒们，因此也给我们保证当他升入天堂将与我们同在的吗？在他嘱咐门徒要将福音传给万民（给整个世界）后他说了什么？ alt
Matthew 28:20
“Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
马太福音28：20“我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”

·   As Christians we ought to take our Savior’s presence as a great comfort to know that when I go forth with his Word, I have his own personal attendance. That way, when his Word is rejected and denied, I also take the comfort in his Words, which say, “If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them” (Luke 9:5). And later he said to the 72, “He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me” (Luke 10:16). Also, his continual presence in our ministry is strength and confidence for the Christian, in order that we might not hesitate to perform the tasks of his kingdom cheerfully.
·        作为基督徒，我们应该把救主与我们同在作为极大的安慰，因为知道当我们奔向他的话语，有他亲自看护。那样，当他的话被拒绝和否认时，我同样在他话语里得安慰，他说“凡不接待你们的，你们离开那城的时候，要把脚上的尘土剁下去，见证他们的不是”（路加福音9：5）。后来他对差遣的72个人说：“听从你们的就是听从我：弃绝你们的就是弃绝我。” （路加福音10：16）。还有，在我们的事工中他不断与我们同在就是给于基督徒力量和信心，好让我们毫不犹豫地并高兴地执行他天国的任务。

哥林多前书11:23-25
26While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
27Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. 28This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."
他們吃的時候、耶穌拿起餅來、祝福、就擘開、遞給門徒、說、你們拿著喫，這是我的身體。
26:27 又 拿起杯來、祝謝了、遞給他們、說、你們都喝這個，
26:28 因為這是我立約的血、為多人流出來、使罪得赦。
26:29 但 我告訴你們、從今以後、我不再喝這葡萄汁、直到我在我父的國裡、同你們喝新的那日子。

22While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
23Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.
24"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them. 25"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."
14:22 他們 吃的時候，耶穌拿起餅來，祝了福，就擘開，遞給他們，說：「你們拿著吃，這是我的身體」；
14:23 又拿起 杯來，祝謝了，遞給他們；他們都喝了。
14:24 耶穌說：「這是我立約的血，為多人流出來的。
14:25 我實在告訴你們，我不再喝這葡萄汁，直到我在　神的國裏喝新的那日子。」
19And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
20In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
１９ 又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就掰开，递给他们，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。”
２０ 饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。	23For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." 25In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."
我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的，就是主耶稣被卖的那一 夜，拿起饼来，
２４ 祝谢了，就掰开，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的（“舍”有古卷作“掰开”），你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。”
２５ 饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我的血所立的新约，你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。”
                                                                                                  alt
·   Nowhere else in Scripture do we have the words of institution recorded. But before we look at the 3 different interpretations and human arguments regarding this precious meal, let’s remember the words of St. Paul:
·   圣经别处没有记录设立圣餐的话。但在我们看3处不同释经和人们关于这宝贵的圣餐的争论前，让我们记住圣保罗的话：

I Corinthians 2:10,12-14
“But God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God… We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.”
哥林多前书2:10,12-14只有神借着圣灵向我们显明了。因为圣灵参透万事，就是神深奥的事也参透了。12 我们所领受的，并不是世上的灵，乃是从神来的灵，叫我们能知道神开恩赐给我们的事。13 并且我们讲说这些事，不是用人智慧所指教的言语，乃是用圣灵所指教的言语，将属灵的话，解释属灵的事。（或作将属灵的事讲与属灵的人）14 然而属血气的人不领会神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙。并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。

1.     How has God revealed his Word to us?
       神如何向我们显明他的话语？

2.    Why does Paul say that we received the Spirit of God and not the spirit of the world?
       保罗为什么说我们领受神的灵而不是世上的灵？

3.   What do you suppose the deep things of God are?
      你认为神是什么深奥的东西？

What do others Teach and Why?
其他人教导什么和为什么那样教？

第二部分
· The Roman Catholic Church, with its hierarchy believes and confesses that by the power of the pope, cardinal, bishop, priest etc., that when they announce the words of institution over the elements, the bread and wine are miraculously “crossed over” (transubstantiated) into the body and blood of Jesus and bread and wine is no longer present. This led to the middle age superstition that the laity couldn’t receive the blood, for fear they would spill it and since the Catholics reasoned that blood was naturally in the body, they would just distribute the body of Christ to the laity for fear they might spill it. Some to this day still practice that. Also, when the meal is over with, they still believe that the consecrated bread and wine, now body and blood of Christ still remains his body and blood so they put it away in a safe for later use.
·   罗马天主教会，具有等级制度相信并宣称通过教皇，红衣主教，主教，牧师等人的力量，当他们在饼和葡萄汁的物质的东西上宣告设立的话语，饼和葡萄汁就神奇地转变成耶稣的身体和血，饼和葡萄汁不再存在了。这导致中世纪的迷信，非神职人员不能接受血，因为害怕他们把血洒出来，既然天主教的理由是血自然地存在身体内，他们因为怕外人把血洒了就把基督的身体分给他们。有些教会至今仍然遵行这个。同样，当圣餐结束，他们仍相信神圣的饼和血，已是基督的身体和血还保留在他的身上，所以他们把它放在保险柜收起来留着以后用。

·   Because the teaching of the Real Presence is the subject of our study, let’s look at the Reform argument of symbolic representation: Ulrich Zwingli, a contemporary of Martin Luther, was rather crude in his interpretation of the words of institution. He declared that the word “is” means “signifies”; the bread signifies the body of Christ and the wine signifies the blood of Christ. He flatly denied that the body and blood of Christ were present in the Lord’s Supper, and ridiculed Lutherans that by insisting on the real presence of the Lord’s body they acted very much as did the children of Israel in the wilderness when they yearned for the “flesh pots” of Egypt (Exodus 16:3).
·   因为圣体实在的教学是我们学习的主题，让我们看看象征性陈述的改革宗派争论：慈运理，一个当代的马丁。路德，但他对设立圣餐的阐释相当粗糙。他宣称“是”意思是“表示”：饼表示基督的身体，葡萄汁表示基督的血。他坚决反对基督的身体和血在主的晚餐中与我们同在，并奚落路德宗信徒他们坚持主的身体的圣体实在就像在旷野的以色列子民渴望埃及的“肉锅”（出埃及记16：3）
His argument for his own cause was pretty foolish, from a theological standpoint. He made the mistake of pointing to such passages as, for instance, where Christ calls himself the “gate” in John 10:7 when Jesus said, “I am the gate for the sheep.” Zwingly maintained that Christ is not a gate, but that he signifies a gate.

从神学的角度看，他的辩论理由是很愚蠢的。他错误地指出例如章节，当基督在约翰福音10：7称他自己“门，”耶稣说“我就是羊的门。” 慈运理坚持基督不是门，但他代表一个门。
altaltalt
Do you see the foolishness of his argument? If Christ signified a gate, then we might ask “what kind of gate does he signify?” “A gate that has bars on it?” “A gate that is used for cattle?” “A wood-paneled gate?”
你看到他争论的愚蠢之处吗？如果基督代表门，那我们可以问“他代表哪种门？”“一个有栅栏的门吗？”“一个给牛进出的门吗？”“一个木嵌板门吗？”

Christ doesn’t signify or represent a gate. If anything, a gate is what signifies Christ. For just as a gate is used to enter someone’s house or property or sheep pen, so it is that no one enters the Father’s kingdom except through the gate, which IS Jesus Christ. Since the definition of a gate is something that opens and closes, it is therefore proper to say, “Yes, Jesus is a gate.”  alt
基督不是表示或代表一个门。如果有什么区别的话，就是一个门是代表着基督什么地方。因为正如门是用于进入某人家或地产或羊圈，因此无人能进入父的国除非经过这道门，也就是耶稣基督。既然门的定义是关和开的东西，因此正确的说法是“是的，耶稣就是门。”   

·   John Calvin, who died in 1564 in Geneva, held similar views to those of Zwingli, but his arguments were a little cleverer. He believed that the communicant was really nourished by the body and blood of Christ, yet he denied the real presence because he insisted that the body of Christ was in heaven, where Jesus ascended and therefore could not be here on earth. Calvin taught that the communicant was elevated in their hearts and minds into heaven where Christ is, and there is where the communicant apprehends the blessings that are “signified” by the earthly elements.
·   约翰。加尔文，1564年在日内瓦去世，和慈运理持相似观点，但他的辩论稍聪明些。他相信领圣餐者被 基督的身体和血所滋养，但他否认圣体存在因为他坚持基督的身体在天堂，基督已升天，因此不可能在世上。加尔文教导领圣餐者的心灵与思想被提升到天堂，耶稣在的地方，在那他们能理解由物质的东西“代表”的祝福。

When it’s all said and done, what do the Scriptures plainly set forth for us? Jesus said, “This is my body…” “This is my blood.” Instead of trying to outsmart the plain Word of God, let us remember that our Lord expects us to approach his Word with the hearts of little children. In other words, unwavering faith!
归根到底，圣经对我们明白地提出什么？耶稣说，“这是我的身体。。。”“这是我的血，”不要试图自作聪明阐释神明白的话语，让我们记住神希望我们以孩子的心去理解他的话。换句话说，坚定的信心！
Matthew 18:3 “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”
马太福音18：3“我实在告诉你们，你们若不会转，变成小孩子的样式，断不得进天国。”

Let us bear in mind the words of King Solomon as we approach the plain words of the Bible…
当我们接近圣经明白的话语时，让我们记住所罗门王的话。。。

Proverbs 30:6 Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.
箴言30：6 他的言语你不可加添，恐怕他责备你，你就选为说谎的。

What are the Blessings of the Lord’s Supper?
主的晚餐的赐福是什么？

 Some helpful passages:
一些有帮助的章节：
I Corinthians 11:25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”
哥林多前书11：25 饭后也照样拿起杯来，说，“这杯是用我的血所立的新约，你们每逢喝的时候要如此行，为的是纪念我。”
1. When I take the Lord’s Supper, I’m reminded of…
每当我吃主的晚餐，使我想起。。。
Matthew 26:28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
马太福音26：28 这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
2. What does God give to me in this sacred meal?
神在这神圣的晚餐里给我什么？
Matthew 26:26-28 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body." Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”
马太福音26：26-28他們吃的時候、耶穌拿起餅來、祝福、就擘開、遞給門徒、說、你們拿著喫，這是我的身體。又拿起杯來、祝謝了、遞給他們、說、你們都喝這個， 因為這是我立約的血、為多人流出來、使罪得赦。 但我告訴你們、從今以後、我不再喝這葡萄汁、直到我在我父的國裡、同你們喝新的那日子。
3. Most importantly, in a miraculous way what does Jesus give that sinners so desperately need…
最重要的是，耶稣以奇妙的方式给与罪人极其需要的什么。。。


 For whom is the Lord’s Supper intended?
主的晚餐是为谁预备的？

I Corinthians 11:23-26
23For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me." 25In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me." 26For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
哥林多前书11:23-26我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的，就是主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来，祝谢了，就掰开，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的（“舍”有古卷作“掰开”），你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。”饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我的血所立的新约，你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。”你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。
1. When Paul says, “23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you…” what is the significance of these words “passed on to you”? Who did Paul pass these words on to?
当保罗说，“我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的。。。”“传给你”的重要意义是什么？保罗把这话传给谁？
2. When Paul says that we “proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes,” what is God giving like-minded Christians the opportunity to do?
当保罗说我们“表明主的死，直等到他来，”神给心意相同的基督徒机会做什么？
· The Lutheran Church has long practiced an unpopular teaching in the eyes of the world called “Closed Communion,” which entails the following instructions before we take communion with another Christian…
路德教会一直执行在世人眼里不受欢迎的“内部圣餐”的教导，伴随以下在我们与其它信徒领用圣餐前的指导。。。
1. The Christian must be thoroughly instructed in the Word of God
基督徒必须完全地由神的话语指导。
2. The Christian must recognize that in the Lord’s Supper we receive Jesus’ body and blood in a miraculous way.
基督徒必须承认在主的晚餐中我们奇妙地接受耶稣的身体和血。
3. The person must be able to examine themselves. Mental illness or young age might affect the Christian’s ability to “examine him/herself”
人必须省察自己。有精神疾病或年幼者可能影响基督徒自我省察的能力。
4. Christians who are repentant of their sins and not living in open sin
基督徒悔改自己的罪，不明目张胆犯罪。
5. Christians who confess a common faith to all the teachings of the Bible
基督徒对圣经所有的教导承认共同的信仰。

What is the Requirement for Fellowship

Philippians 1:27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel
腓利比书1：27只要你們行事為人與基督的福音相稱．叫我或來見你們、或不在你們那裡、可以聽見你們的景況、知道你們同有一個心志、站立得穩、為所信的福音齊心努力．
1. Most church bodies today seek unity on the basis of minimizing differences. Why do you think God’s Word teaches us to be “perfectly united,” or standing in “one spirit”?
大多数教会团体今天基于把差别极小化以寻求统一。你认为神的话为什么教导我们要“ 完美的合一，“或同有一個心志“？
2. Can someone who believes in Transubstantiation and a person who believes in Representation and a person who believes in the Real Presence of Christ’s body and blood, take communion together and really say that they are “one in spirit,” and “perfectly united in mind and thought”?
相信圣餐变体的人，和相信圣餐代表意义的人，和相信基督的身体和血的圣体实在的人能在一起领用圣餐并真地说他们是“同一心志”，和“在心灵和思想上完美合一”吗？

第三部分

John 14:6 Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father altexcept through me.alt
约翰福音14：6 耶稣回答说，：“我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉著我，没有人能到父那里去。“
Acts 4:12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."
使徒行传4：12除 他 以 外 ， 别 无 拯 救 ； 因 为 在 天 下 人 间 ， 没 有 赐 下 别 的 名 ， 我 们 可 以 靠 着 得 救 。
Cult – A cult denies that Jesus is true God and denies that he is the Savior. A person who belongs to a cult is going to hell because Jesus offers mankind no other way of salvation except through him. Examples of modern day cults – The Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons); Jehovah Witnesses. Both of these cults deny that Jesus is true God.
邪教—邪教否定耶稣是真神，否定他是救主。一个属于邪教的人将下地狱，因为耶稣为人类提供唯有通过他的救赎之路。现代邪教的例子---后期圣徒的教会（摩门教），耶和华见证会。这些邪教都否认耶稣是真神。

Isaiah 55:11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
以赛亚书55：11我 口 所 出 的 话 也 必 如 此 ， 决 不 徒 然 返 回 ， 却 要 成 就 我 所 喜 悦 的 ， 在 我 发 他 去 成 就 （ 发 他 去 成 就 ： 或 译 所 命 定 ） 的 事 上 必 然 亨 通 。
Hebrews 10:23-25 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another – and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
希伯来书10：23-25也 要 坚 守 我 们 所 承 认 的 指 望 ， 不 至 摇 动 。 因 为 那 应 许 我 们 的 是 信 实 的 。 又 要 彼 此 相 顾 ， 激 发 爱 心 ， 勉 励 行 善 。 你 们 不 可 停 止 聚 会 ， 好 像 那 些 停 止 惯 了 的 人 ， 倒 要 彼 此 劝 勉 。 既 知 道 （ 原 文 作 看 见 ） 那 日 子 临 近 ， 就 更 当 如 此 。
Heterodox Christian Church – Heterodox refers to a church that has turned away from accepted Scriptural teachings. A heterodox church uses the Word of God and teaches that Jesus is true God and the only Savior of mankind. However, because they no longer hold “unswervingly” to the Word of God, their faith is in constant pressure from the false teachings. Therefore, members of a heterodox church fail to enjoy the full freedom, which God intended for us to have.
异端基督教会---异端指一个教会不接受公认的圣经教导。一个异端基督教会使用神的话语，教导耶稣是真神和人类的唯一救主。然而，因为他们不再坚定不移持守神的话，他们的信心不断受到错误的教义的压力。因此，一个异端基督教会的信徒无法享受神想要给我们的完全的自由。
 John 8:31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are reallyalt my disciples. Then you will know thealt truth, and the truth will set you free.”
约翰福音8：31耶 穌 對 信 他 的 猶 太 人 說 、 你 們 若 常 常 遵 守 我 的 道 、 就 真 是 我 的 門 徒 。你 們 必 曉 得 真 理 、 真 理 必 叫 你 們 得 以 自 由 。
1. Is it possible for a group or gathering of believers to have all of the teachings of Jesus as they are taught in the Bible?
对于一群聚会的信徒有可能按照圣经里教导的掌握所有的耶稣的教义吗？
2. Is the “truth” dependant on who the interpreter is or is the truth surmountable and possible to have and hold to?
真理是依赖于释经的人吗还是真理是可以掌握，拥有和坚持的？
3. Why is Jesus so interested that we not only have the truth, but that we “hold to the truth?”
为什么耶稣如此关注我们不仅要拥有真理，而且要坚持真理？
I Timothy 2:3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
提摩太前书2：3这是好的，在　神我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。他愿意万人得救，明白真道。
Who said it?
这话是谁说的？
“If anyone says that all the sins which are committed after baptism are either forgiven or made forgivable only by remembering and believing in the baptism that has been received, let him be damned.” (Trid. Sess. VII, Can. 10)
“如果有人说受洗后所有犯下的罪被赦免，或只是因着纪念和相信所受的洗礼而得宽恕，就定他的罪。”
“If anyone says that faith alone is sufficient preparation for partaking of the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist, let him be damned.” (Trid. Sess. XIII, Can. 11)
“如果有人说仅靠信心就足够预备分享最神圣的圣餐仪式，就定他的罪。”
• Just with these two statements, it’s obvious where the Roman Catholic Church stands on justification. That is what makes them so dangerously deceptive because they are appealing to man’s sinful nature when they tell them that Christ’s sacrifice was not enough.
• 显然罗马天主教堂就是以这两个声明作为坚持的理由所在。那使他们具有很危险的欺骗性，因为当他们告诉信徒基督的牺牲不足够为世人赎罪时，他们是受人的罪恶本性驱使。
“If anyone says that men are justified either alone by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ, or alone by the remission of sins...Let him be damned.” (Trid. Sess. VI, Can. 11)
“如果有人说人称义或是仅归咎于基督的正义，或是仅通过罪的赦免。。。就定他的罪。”
Pope Boniface VIII (Nov. 18, 1302)
“We are compelled with a firm faith to believe in the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church itself and to hold that … outside of it there is no salvation or remission of sins…Furthermore we declare, say, define and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human being should be subject to the Roman pope.”
罗马教皇 搏尼费斯8世（Nov.18，1302）
“我们只能以坚定的信心相信神圣的天主教和使徒教会本身，并持守在它之外没有救赎和赦免罪。。。此外我们宣称，宣讲，规定，断言每个人应该从属于罗马教皇，对于救赎是绝对必要的。”
Matthew 28:20 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
马太福音28：19-20所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（注：或作“给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”
1. Why does Jesus want us to teach his children “everything” that his Word taught us and not withhold anything from others?
为什么耶稣让我们用他教导我们的话在万事上教训他的子民，不要向他人隐瞒任何事？
2. Agree or Disagree: God’s Word is clear. The reason that different Christian church bodies come to different conclusions is because of the devil and the mind of sinful man unwilling to submit to the whole truth.
同意或不同意：神的话是清楚的。不同教会肢体得出不同结论的理由是因为魔鬼和 人罪性的意志，不愿服从完全的真理。
2 Thessalonians 2:10b-12 They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
帖撒罗尼迦后书2：10-12并且在那沉沦的人身上行各样出于不义的诡诈；因他们不领受爱真理的心，使他们得救。故此，　神就给他们一个生发错误的心，叫他们信从虚谎，使一切不信真理，倒喜爱不义的人，都被定罪。
Judging Christians or Judging Teachings
论断基督徒或论断教义
• Clearly the Bible teaches us not to look down on other people as though we are more deserving of altsalvation than anyone else. Jesus altsays, “Do not judge, or you too will be judged.” Even the apostle Paul who teaches us to be “perfectly united in mind and thought” (1 Corinthians 1:10) chastised the Jewish Christians at Rome for looking down on their Gentile brothers and sisters in the church (Romans 2:21-24). Under no circumstances is the Christian ever to think that he is better or more deserving of God’s grace than anyone else, including the most horrifying people in society who have committed the most grievous acts known to man. For Jesus teaches us through the life and example of Paul, formerly a persecutor and blasphemer of the church, that his patience and love knows no limitations. Jesus also teaches us through the story of the thief dying on the cross next to him that his grace is extended to all sinners!
• 圣经明确地教导我们不要轻视他人，好像我们比别人更配得救赎。耶稣说，“不要论断他人，免得你们被论断。”即使使徒保罗教导我们“只要一心一意”（哥林多前书1：10）严惩罗马的犹太基督徒，因他们轻视教会的外邦弟兄姊妹（罗马书2：21-24）。基督徒绝不能认为自己比其他人更配得神的恩典，包括比在世上犯下滔天罪行的恶人。因为耶稣通过原本是个迫害并亵渎教会的保罗的生命和例子，教导我们他的耐心和爱是没有极限的。耶稣还通过钉死在他旁边的窃贼的故事教导我们他的恩典延伸到所有罪人！
• Therefore, when Christians practice the biblical teaching of close(d) communion, it is not about looking down upon other Christians. Rather, it is about being true to the Word of God and showing love to our Savior who commands us to “obey everything he has taught us.” It’s called “close” communion because those who commune to our right and to our left have been instructed in the truth of God’s Word and confess the same things as we do about our faith. It’s called “closed” communion because our love for God’s Word forbids us from sharing the Lord’s Supper with those who are not united in faith with us.
• 因此，当基督徒实行内部领圣餐的教导时，并不是轻视其他基督徒。更是忠实于神的话 显示对救主的爱 ，他命令我们服从他对我们万事的教导。之所以称为“内部的”圣餐是因为那些在我们左右密切联系的都接受神的话语的真理的教导并承认和我们遵守信仰所做的同样的事。之所以称为“内部的”圣餐是因为我们对神的话语的爱禁止我们与那些与我们的信仰不一致的人分享主的晚餐。

I Corinthians 10:17 “Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.”
哥林多前书10：17“我 们 虽 多 ， 仍 是 一 个 饼 ， 一 个 身 体 。 因 为 我 们 都 是 分 受 这 一 个 饼
1. What does it mean to be “one body” partaking of “one loaf”?
“一 个 身 体”分享“一 个 饼”是什么意思？
 alt
Matthew 7:15,16 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them.”
马太福音7：15，16 “你们要防备假先知，他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。16凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。“
1 John 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
约翰一书4：1亲爱的弟兄阿、一切的灵、你们不可都信。总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是。因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。
1. What is Jesus talking about when he says “By their fruit”?
耶稣说“凭着他们的果子，”是指什么？
2. Does Jesus tell us that a false prophet will be easy to detect or very difficult?
耶稣告诉我们假先知容易辨别还是难以辨别？
3. What test shall we put the preacher or teacher of God’s Word through to determine whether or not we should fellowship with this person?
为了决定我们是否要与那传讲神的道的人和老师有团契，我们要让他们通过什么试验？
4. Can a false teacher still go to heaven, in spite of the fact that he teaches some false things about the Word of God?
尽管一个假师傅错误教导神的话语，他仍然能够进天堂吗？
I Corinthians 3:11-15
11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 13 his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work. 14 If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 15 If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.
哥林多前书3：11-15因为那已经立好的根基，就是耶稣基督，此外没有人能立别的根基。 若有人用金，银，宝石，草木，禾楷，在这根基上建造。各人的工程必然显露。因为那日子要将他表明出来，有火发现。这火要试验各人的工程怎样。 人在那根基上所建造的工程，若存得住，他就要得赏赐。人的工程若被烧了，他就要受亏损。自己却要得救。虽然得救乃像从火里经过的一样。
1. What passes through the fire on the Day of Judgment? (Circle one)
什么在审判日要经历火的试验？（选择一项）
a. Each man’s work
各人的工程
b. Each man
各人
• The Greek text states: ἑκάστου τὸ ἔργον, which means “Each man’s work.” Just a little side note: This is the passage that the Roman Catholics use to support their teaching called, Purgatory. The Roman teaching of Purgatory teaches that when a Christian dies, his soul is purged of the rest of its sins before entering the glories of heaven, which also support their heresy that the death of Jesus wasn’t enough to fully pay for man’s sins. But the words of the text don’t lie. According to Catholic theology, they would have to change the words of St. Paul to say, “Each soul” will pass through fire if they want to support their heresy. But the word ἔργον does not mean “soul,” but rather “Work.”
• 希腊原文是说：ἑκάστου τὸ ἔργον, 意思是 “个人的工程。”一点边注：这是罗马天主教用于支持他们的称作“炼狱”的教义。罗马炼狱的教义教导当一个基督徒死了，他的灵魂在进天国的荣耀前，他的灵魂要清除剩余的罪，这同时支持他们相信耶稣的死不足以偿还人的罪的异端。但是圣经原话不会撒谎。根据天主教神学，他们不得不改变圣保罗的话，如果他们要支持他们的 异端“ 各人的灵魂”就将经历火的试验。但ἔργον一词不是“灵魂，”而是“工程”的意思。
 alt• Gold, silver, costly stones. Precious, durable work that stands the test of divine judgment. These costly stones are metaphors and are symbolic of pure Christian doctrine and living.
金，银，宝石。 珍贵的，牢固的工程经得起神圣的审判。那些宝石是种隐喻，象征纯洁的基督教义和生命。
• Wood, hay or straw. Symbolic of weak, and false teachings, that produce worthless work that will not stand the test of Judgment. alt
木头， 干草，禾楷。象征薄弱的错误教义，建造毫无价值的工程经不住审判的考验。
2. If a person’s work is deemed false and therefore worthless, what might be the result of those who followed this person’s false teaching?
如果一个人的工程被判定是错误的，因此毫无价值，那些跟随这人的错误教导的结果会怎样？
3. Can false teachers still be saved? (v.15)
假师傅能够得救吗？

Jesus instructs us to “Watch out for false prophets.” The apostle Paul expands on what we are to do when we identify false prophets. Read the following…
耶稣教导我们“提防假先知。”使徒保罗详述我们怎样识别假先知。阅读一下章节。。。
Romans 16:17,18 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
罗马书16：17，18弟 兄 们 ， 那 些 离 间 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 跌 倒 ， 背 乎 所 学 之 道 的 人 ， 我 劝 你 们 要 留 意 躲 避 他 们 。 因 为 这 样 的 人 不 服 事 我 们 的 主 基 督 ， 只 服 事 自 己 的 肚 腹 。 用 花 言 巧 语 ， 诱 惑 那 些 老 实 人 的 心 。
1. If we join a group of believers who don’t believe all of the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, who might be affected by our presence?
如果我们加入一群信徒 ，他们不相信所有的耶稣和门徒的教导，我们参加可能会影响谁？
2. Agree or disagree: As long as I know what the truth is, it doesn’t matter who I worship with and take communion with as long as I know what the truth is. If someone naively believes something false, that’s their own fault.
同意与否：只要我知道真理，与谁一起敬拜和领圣餐没有关系。如果有人无知地相信错误的东西，那是他们自己的错。alt

Mark 12:28-31 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" 29"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' 31The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."
马可福音12：28-31有一个文士来，听见他们辩论，晓得耶稣回答得好，就问他说：“诫命中哪是第一要紧的呢？”耶稣回答说：“第一要紧的就是说：‘以色列啊，你要听！主我们神是独一的主。你要尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的　神。’其次就是说：‘要爱人如己。’再没有比这两条诫命更大的了。”
1. Agree or disagree: Giving our neighbor the impression that a church is teaching the truth, when that church really isn’t teaching the WHOLE truth might be damaging to my neighbor’s faith.
同意与否： 让我们的邻居感觉教会是教导真理，而实际上教会没有教导完全的真理，这可能会损害我们的邻居的信心。
Acts 20:25-31 25"Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. 26Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men. 27For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. 28Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. 29I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. 30Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. 31So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
使徒行传20:25-31我 素 常 在 你 們 中 間 來 往 、 傳 講 　 神 國 的 道 、 如 今 我 曉 得 你 們 以 後 都 不 得 再 見 我 的 面 了 。 所 以 我 今 日 向 你 們 證 明 、 你 們 中 間 無 論 何 人 死 亡 、 罪 不 在 我 身 上 。 〔 原 文 作 我 於 眾 人 的 血 是 潔 淨 的 〕 因 為 　 神 的 旨 意 、 我 並 沒 有 一 樣 避 諱 不 傳 給 你 們 的 。 聖 靈 立 你 們 作 全 群 的 監 督 、 你 們 就 當 為 自 己 謹 慎 、 也 為 全 群 謹 慎 、 牧 養 　 神 的 教 會 、 就 是 他 用 自 己 血 所 買 來 的 。 〔 或 作 救 贖 的 〕 我 知 道 我 去 之 後 、 必 有 兇 暴 的 豺 狼 、 進 入 你 們 中 間 、 不 愛 惜 羊 群 。 就 是 你 們 中 間 、 也 必 有 人 起 來 、 說 悖 謬 的 話 、 要 引 誘 門 徒 跟 從 他 們 。 所 以 你 們 應 當 儆 醒 、 記 念 我 三 年 之 久 、 晝 夜 不 住 的 流 淚 、 勸 戒 你 們 各 人 。
1. In the process of saying good bye to the Christians at Ephesus, Paul declares that “He’s innocent of the blood of all men.” Why could he say that?
在与以弗所的基督徒告别时，保罗申明“ 他於 眾 人 的 血 是 潔 淨 的” 他为什么
那样说？
2. What is the “whole will of God”? (Remember what Jesus said in Matthew 28:20?)
什么是“神的完全旨意”？（记得耶稣在马太福音28：20的话吗？）
3. What was Paul warning the Ephesians of for three years?
保罗要以弗所信徒 三年警醒什么？
• Please pay close attention to the words of God: The truth wouldn’t be taken completely away from the Ephesians. No, verse 30 reminds us that the truth would be “distorted,” which means manipulated or falsely presented so that many naïve people would soon have their faith destroyed. No wonder why Paul cried night and day!
• 请集中注意神的话语：真理不会完全脱离以弗所信徒。不会，30节提醒我们真理会被“歪曲”，意思是被假造或错误呈现，因此很多无知的人的信仰很快被扭曲。难怪保罗昼夜哭泣！
• To know the truth, but then cover or conceal it up and not defend it with your life and limb is perhaps the highest form of hypocrisy, which is why Jesus tells us in his Word, “If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels” (Luke 9:26).
知道真理，但另一方面掩盖或隐藏起来，不冒生命危险捍卫是伪善的最高形式，这就是为什么耶稣在圣经上说，“凡把我和我的道当作可耻的、人子在自己的荣耀里、并天父与圣天使的荣耀里、降临的时候、也要把那人当作可耻的。”（路加福音9：26）
 altTitus 1:9 (speaking to the elders and pastors of the church)
提多书1：9（对教会的长老和牧师所说）
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
他必须坚定持守可靠教训正如神教导的，因此他能够用纯正的教义激励他人并驳斥反对的人。
1. Pastors and leaders of a church have a very distinctive role in that they are to shepherd God’s flock by doing what?
牧师和教会领导以很不同的角色牧养神的羊群，他们的事工有什么不同？
2 John 10,11 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him. 11Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
约翰二书10，11若 有 人 到 你 們 那 裡 、 不 是 傳 這 教 訓 、 不 要 接 他 到 家 裡 、 也 不 要 問 他 的 安
．因 為 問 他 安 的 、 就 在 他 的 惡 行 上 有 分 。
Agree or Disagree: To join in a fellowship with a group of Christians who believe doctrines or teachings that are foreign to the Bible or Scripture means that we share in their wicked work because all false teaching is wicked, be it ever so small.
同意与否：和一群相信的教义或教导是和圣经相异的信徒组成的团契就意味着我们分享他们的异恶工程，因为所有错误教导是异恶的。
• The doctrine of church fellowship, when properly practiced, is a decisive statement of love; love for God’s Word, love for our own souls, and love for the souls of others. It is always to be practiced in humility.
合适执行教会团契的教义，是明确的爱的表述；爱神的 道，爱我们自已的灵魂，爱他人的灵魂。总是以谦卑的态度执行。
• These truths become more and more appealing as we grow in our understanding of God’s love for us and for all, and as we grow in our understanding of His Word.
随着我们对于神爱我们，爱一切，以及对于神的道的理解上不断成长，这些真理 变得越来越吸引我们。
Hebrews 5:11-14 We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn. In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
希伯来书5：11-14论到麦基洗德，我们有好些话，并且难以解明，因为你们听不进去。
看你们学习的工夫，本该作师傅，谁知还得有人将　神圣言小学的开端另教导你们，并且成了那必须吃奶、不能吃干粮的人。凡只能吃奶的，都不熟练仁义的道理，因为他是婴孩； 惟独长大成人的，才能吃干粮，他们的心窍习练得通达，就能分辨好歹了。
• God is so concerned for our souls that he issues many warning to us throughout the Bible to mark and avoid those who practice or tolerate error. The idea of churches minimizing their doctrinal differences and agreeing to disagree on what key points of the Bible teach is not only foreign to what Jesus and the apostles instruct of us, but it is an outward confession of faith that says we really can’t hold to the teachings of Jesus, in spite of the fact that Jesus says that we can!
神如此关心我们的灵，因此他通过圣经警醒我们多次要分清和避免那些实行或容忍错误的人。对于教会把教义的不同极小化的观点，并同意关于圣经要点上的分歧不仅是与耶稣和使徒的教训相异，而且是公开表明我们不能持守耶稣的教训，不管耶稣说我们能做到的事实。

What Makes us Worthy Recipients of the Lord’s Supper
什么使我们配得主的晚餐？
1 Corinthians 11:27-29
“Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.”
哥林多前书11：27-29所以无论何人，不配的吃主的饼，喝主的杯，就是得罪主的身体和主的血了。人应当察验自己，然后吃这饼，喝这杯。因为那吃喝的，若不分辨那身体，就是给自己吃喝审判了。
1. If we don’t know what we are doing or partake of the meal in such a way that our hearts are really not sorry for sin, what does Paul say we will be doing?
如果我们不知道我们在做什么或在分享主的晚餐时，心中却不真地为罪悔过的话，保罗说我们将怎样？
2. To examine myself, I would look at God’s commandments and then measure my thoughts, my words, and my actions in that light. If I do that honestly, what will I have to admit?
为了监察自身，我要查看神的戒律，然后衡量自已的想法，言语，和在那方面的行为。如果我诚实去做，我就应该承认什么？
3. If I don’t recognize that the body and blood of our Lord in the Supper, what am I doing?
如果我不承认在晚餐中主的身体和血，我在做什么？
4. What should I do if I have taken this meal in an unworthy manner in the past?
如果我过去一直以不合适的方式领用圣餐，我应该怎么办？

如果我的信心很弱，我应该领用圣餐吗？（马太11:28-29,以赛亚书40:29-31, 42:3)
Martin Luther said in his Small Catechism:
马丁路德在他的小要理中说：
“Fasting and other outward preparations may serve a good purpose, but he is properly prepared who believes these words: “Given” and “poured out for you for the forgiveness of sins.” But whoever does not believe these words or doubts them is not prepared, because the words “for you” require nothing but hearts that believe.
“禁食和其他外在准备也许能提供好的目的，但是相信：“已给”和“为多人流出来，使罪赦免。”的人是完全预备好了。但不信这话或质疑的是没预备好的，因为“为你”这话只要求心里相信。
