Thought Questions:思考问题：
1. In this lesson we learned two main truths about Jesus: He is 100% God and 100% human. In
your own words, why are both of those facts so vital for your salvation?
本课我们学到有关耶稣的两大真理：他是100% 的神，又是 100%的人。用自己的话说出，为什么这两大真理对你的得救至关重要？
2. Why are you glad to know that Jesus is 100% human, just like you are?
就像你一样，耶稣是100%的人，这为什么让你很高兴？
3. Why are you glad to know that Jesus is the 100% God, the ruler of all things?
耶稣是100%的神，是万物的主宰，这为什么也让你很高兴？
4. John 5:23 says, “He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.” In other words, if you reject Jesus you have rejected the true God. Additionally,
in John 14:6 Jesus says, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”
Some religions say that Jesus was a great prophet, but not the true God. Evaluate that teaching
and determine what the implications of it are.
约5：23说，“不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父。”换句话说，如果你拒绝耶稣，你就已经拒绝了这位真神。另外，约14：6节说：“耶稣说，我就是道路、 真理、 生命； 若不藉着我， 没有人能到父那里去。”有的宗教说，耶稣是个伟大的先知，而不是真神。评价那种教导，指出它可能造成的后果是什么？
Write the passages, from memory if possible.  写经文,尽可能默写：
2Cor. 5:21  God ----- him who ----- no ----- to be sin ---- ------, so that --- ------- we might ---------- the ---------------- of God.

圣经书卷 （写出新约各卷书，尽可能默写）。

Addendum #1附录#1

Jesus said that in the last days many false teachers would arise.  Because that happened and continues to happen, the church has periodically felt it necessary to make simple, public declarations of the truths of the Bible so that what the church believed and taught would be clear to everyone.  The Apostle’s Creed is one such declaration of faith.  It was developed in the 100’s as a confession which adults could give before they were baptized.
耶稣说，在末后的日子，将会出现很多假教师。因为假教师已经出现，而且还会继续出现，基督教会认为，有必要定期对圣经真理做简单、公开的声明，使每一个人都能清楚教会所相信并教导的真理。使徒信经就是这样一种对信仰的声明。它出现于公元100年，作为成年人受洗前的信仰表白。
The Apostle’s Creed (so named because it’s an accurate reflection of what Jesus and His apostles had taught) presents what the Bible teaches about God and does so in an organized, simple fashion.  It can be divided into three sections – also called “articles” – each section basically corresponding to one of the three persons in the God-head.  Below is the Apostle’s Creed.
使徒信经（这样命名是因为它具体反映了耶稣以及门徒的教导）呈现了圣经关于神的教导，而且呈现得简洁且有条理。它可以分为三个部分，或作“三项”，每部分对神的一个位格作出基要的阐述。以下为使徒信经。

The First Article: I  believe in God, the Father almighty,maker of heaven and earth.
第一部分：我信上帝，全能的父，创造天地的主。
The Second Article: I  believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,who was conceived by the Virgin Mary,suffered under Pontius Pilate,was crucified, died, and was buried.He descended into hell.The third day He rose again from the dead.He ascended into heave and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
第二部分： 我信我主耶稣基督，是上帝的独生子，因圣灵感孕，为童贞女马利亚所生，在本丢彼拉多手下受难，被钉在十字架上，受死，埋葬，降在阴间，第三天从死里复活，升天，坐在全能父上帝的右边，将来必从那里降临，审判活人死人。

The Third Article: I  believe in the Holy Spirit,the holy Christian Church,the communion of saints,the forgiveness of sins,the resurrection of the body,and the life everlasting.    Amen.
第三部分： 我信圣灵。我信圣而公之教会。我信圣徒相通。我信罪得赦免。我信身体复活。我信永生。阿们！

Martin Luther was a pastor in Germany in the early and middle 1500’s.  Recognizing the great difficulty which many people have in teaching the Bible to their children, Luther wrote the Catechism.  The Catechism, like the Apostle’s Creed, presented the truths of the Bible in a simple, orderly way.  The difference is that the Creed was meant to be used in worship services and was quite short.  The Catechism was longer, to be used as a teaching aid.
马丁-路德是公元1500年早期和中期的德国牧师。他认识到，在向孩童教导圣经时，很多人都遇到了一个极大的难题，为此他编写了《教理问答》。《教理问答》如使徒信经一样，将圣经真理以简单且有条理的方式呈现出来。两者的区别是，信经用于教会崇拜，内容较短。《教理问答》更长一些，用于教学辅助。
As a part of the Catechism, Luther wrote explanations of the three sections of the Apostle’s Creed.  (he did this by compiling the applicable passages from the Bible and then summarizing them.)  Because they are a good, accurate summary of Biblical truths, we still use them today.  Below is Luther’s explanation of the 2nd Article of the Apostle’s Creed.
作为《教理问答》的一部分内容，路德解释了使徒信经的三个部分（他编辑了圣经的相关经文，然后加以归纳）。因为他在其中对圣经真理做了精确完美的归纳，所以我们今天仍然在使用。下面是路德对使徒信经的第二部分做的解释。
The Second Article:     I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, … (see above)
第二部分：       我信我主耶稣基督，是上帝的独生子，因圣灵感孕，为童贞女马利亚所生，在本丢彼拉多手下受难，被钉在十字架上，受死，埋葬，降在阴间，第三天从死里复活，升天，坐在全能父上帝的右边，将来必从那里降临，审判活人死人。

What does this mean?这是什么意思？
I believe that Jesus Christ, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord.
我相信耶稣基督，他是自由永有之父神的独生爱子。他也是真正的人，由童贞女玛利亚所生。他是我的主。
He has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sin, from death and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with his holy, precious blood and with his innocent suffering and death.
他已经将我救赎，一个迷失受咒诅的被造物。他将我从一切的罪、死亡和仇敌的权势中赎买，赢回。不是用金银赎买，而是用他圣洁的宝血、用他无辜的痛苦和死亡赎买。
All this he did that I should be his own, and live under him in his kingdom, and serve him in everlasting righteousness, innocence and blessedness, just as he has risen from death and lives and rules eternally.
因他为我所做的这一切，我应该是他的，而且在他的国度中，由他管理，在永恒的仁义、圣洁和祝福中服侍他，正如他从死里复活，活在永恒里掌权一样。
This is most certainly true.
这是千真万确的。
