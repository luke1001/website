Prayer 祈祷

Ephesians 1:17-18 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance…

弗 1:17-18 求我们主耶稣基督的 神，荣耀的父，将那赐人智慧和启示的灵赏给你们，使你们真知道他；并且照明你们心中的眼睛，使你们知道他的恩召有何等指望，他在圣徒中得的基业有何等丰盛的荣耀；

Let this be our goal as we examine God’s Word: That we may know him better!

当我们考察神话语的时候，让我们以此目标：使我们能更好的认识神！

### I. HOW DID MANKIND FALL INTO SIN? Read Genesis 3:1-14 人类是如何堕落的？读创3：1-14

1. Remember, God had told Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. As the devil comes, God’s Word tells us that he came to Adam and Eve “craftier than all the wild beasts.”

      记住，上帝已经告诉亚当和夏娃不要吃分别善恶树的果子。当魔鬼来的时候，经上告诉我们“他比田野一切的活物更狡猾。”

    What question did he ask Eve in 3:1?

    在3：1神问夏娃什么问题？

    What bold lie did Satan say to Eve in v. 4?

    在4节中，撒旦对夏娃说了什么大胆的谎言？

    Some helpful passages: 辅助经文：

    Genesis 5:1,3 When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. (3) When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image…

    创5：1，3 创 5:1 亚当的后代记在下面：当 神造人的日子，是照着自己的样式造的； （3）亚当活到一百三十岁，生了一个儿子，形象样式和自己相似，就给他起名叫塞特。

    The Bible teaches us that the essence of God is a spirit and therefore he is invisible to mankind. Read the following…

    圣经教导我们神的本质是个灵，因此不能被人所见。请读以下经文：

    John 1:18 No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.

    约 1:18 从来没有人看见 神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。

    John 4:24 “God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."

    约 4:24 神是个灵(或无“个”字)所以拜他的，必须用心灵和诚实拜他。

5. So when the Bible teaches us that Adam and Eve were created in the “Likeness” and “Image” of God, what does that mean? (Circle One)

    A. 上帝的完全和圣洁的样式            B. 亚当和夏娃的罪的样式样式

    Read the following passages and identify the impact of Adam and Eve’s sin upon the whole human race…

    读经文，明白亚当夏娃的罪给人类带来的影响…… clip-image006

    Romans 5:12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned—

    罗 5:12 这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的；于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪。

7. Even though God traces the guilt of sin back to one man (Adam) who does he apply the punishment of death to on the account of Adam’s sin.

    神追究罪是由亚当而出,他对亚当犯罪结果的惩罚就是死亡.

    Psalm 51:5 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.

    诗 51:5 我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎的时候，就有了罪。

8. In fact, not only are we sinful at birth, but from what moment?

    实际上，不是我们出生时候才有罪，从何时起我们就有罪了？

    Job 14:4 Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!

    伯 14:4 谁能使洁净之物出于污秽之中呢？无论谁也不能！

    clip-image008

9. What sobering truth does the prophet Job teach us about new born babies?

    有关新生儿，先知约伯道出了什么清楚的事实？

    Mark 7:21 For out of men’s hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man unclean.

    可7：21因为从里面，就是从人心里，发出恶念、苟合、偷盗、凶杀、奸淫、贪婪、邪恶、诡诈、淫荡、嫉妒、谤讟、骄傲、狂妄。

10. Our sinful condition doesn’t remain hidden, but shows itself in many ways.

    B. Sin always begins in the heart and usually manifests itself in the actions of mankind.

    B. 罪是从心而发，通常在人类行为中表现出来。

Application: There are some Christian churches today who teach an Age of Accountability. Though the teaching is nowhere to be found in the Bible, those who Teach this doctrine, make the false assumption that God will automatically save people who are unable to make a Choice for salvation. Sadly, not only is the Age of Accountability not found in the Bible, but also, the teaching that a person can make a Choice for their salvation is nowhere to be found in the Bible. Further explanation to this will be given in our lesson that deals with Baptism and the conversion of a sinner. But for now, it’s important that we understand that the Bible teaches that the whole human race is held accountable for the sin of one man – Adam! And God would be justified in casting the whole world away from his presence for eternity in hell.

应用：如今有些基督徒教会教导对灵里犯罪负责的年龄的教义。然而这种教导在圣经的任何地方都找不到。教导这种教义的人，错误的假设上帝将自动拯救那些不能选择救恩的的人。很悲哀的是，不仅有限生命抉择的教义在圣经中找不到，而且，人类可以选择救恩的教导在圣经里也找不到。在我们的课程当中将会深入讲述洗礼和罪人的拯救。但是现在，重要的是我们要明白圣经教导我们全人类都要为一个人——亚当的罪负责！并且神有理由将这个世界从他的面前永远投到地狱中。

Genesis 6:5-7 5 The LORD saw how great man's wickedness On the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. 6 The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. 7 So the LORD said, "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth— men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them."

创 6:5-7 耶和华见人在地上罪恶很大，终日所思想的尽都是恶； 6 耶和华就后悔造人在地上，心中忧伤。7 耶和华说：“我要将所造的人和走兽，并昆虫，以及空中的飞鸟，都从地上除灭，因为我造他们后悔了。”

11. When God virtually destroyed this world and almost all of civilization with it, should we assume that all the people who were age 13 and younger received a free ticket to heaven? Why or Why not?

    当上帝几乎要毁灭全世界和其上所有的文明时，我们应该假设没到13岁的孩子可以得到一张到天堂的免费票吗？为什么？

    clip-image012

  12.  Why, then, is it dangerous for people to believe that a person has a free pass until they reach the age of 12 or 13 in life?

    为什么相信不到12、13岁的人可以自由到天堂的想法是危险地的？

    Ezekiel 18:4 God says, “the soul who sins is the one who will die.”

    结 18:14 “他若生一个儿子，见父亲所犯的一切罪，便惧怕(有古卷作“思量”)，不照样去作；

13. The fair punishment for sin is what?

    对罪公平的审判是什么？

### II. WHAT DID GOD DETERMINE TO DO FOR SINFUL MANKIND? 对罪人上帝决定做什么？

Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."

创 3:15 我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇；你的后裔和女人的后裔也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头；你要伤他的脚跟。”

After Adam and Eve had sinned God would have had every right to send Adam and Eve to hell for all eternity. Instead, in his boundless love, he immediately gave them the FIRST PROMISE of a Savior. God in the presence of Adam and Eve and the devil spoke this first promise. Fill in the blanks below with the words that are listed in red below the passage.

在亚当夏娃犯罪后，神有足够的理由可以将他们投入地狱。但是，因为他丰盛的爱，他立即给了他们对于罪人的第一个承诺。神在亚当夏娃和魔鬼的面前说了这个承诺。用给出红色字选择填空。

I will put enmity (---------) between you (-----------) and the woman, and between your offspring (----------) and hers (------------). He (Christ) will crush your head (-------------------------) and you (devil) will strike his heel (---------------------).

我又要叫你（ ）和女人彼此为仇（ ）；你的后裔（ ）和女人的后裔（ ）也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头（ ）；你要伤他的脚跟（ ）。”

Division/hatred分裂/憎恨 Destroy the power of the devil 粉碎魔鬼的权势

Cause Christ to die a painful death 使耶稣遭受死亡的痛苦

Unbelievers非信徒 Christ the Savior救主基督 Devil魔鬼

I John 3:8b The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work

约一 3:8b 神的儿子显现出来，为要除灭魔鬼的作为。

Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promise of the Savior, first given in Genesis 3:15.

耶稣基督是神在创3：15应许救主的履行。

John 1:17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

约 1:17 律法本是藉着摩西传的；恩典和真理都是由耶稣基督来的。

Application: Many Christians in this world make the mistake of thinking that Jesus is just another wise, old prophet from the past who teaches his followers to be good little boys and girls in life, by teaching them how to live according to the Ten Commandments. If that was the main purpose Jesus came to this earth, he was wasting his time because we have parents and school teachers to tell us how to be good little boys and girls. True, Jesus does teach us how to live. True, Jesus does want us to follow him and the Ten Commandments. But that’s not why Jesus came into this world. He came into the world with the mission of destroying the Devil’s work, and releasing us from his control. And the way he would do it could not be dreamt up by some human being, or imagined by us. He would destroy Sin, Satan, death, and Hell by becoming the representation of sin for us in this life. He would be our substitute, which meant this: he would have to obey the Law perfectly. What is more, under God’s punishment of sin, which is death, Jesus would also willingly put himself under his Father’s curse of sin and suffer death at the hands of wicked men in this world. His perfect life and innocent death would in turn satisfy God’s wrath against mankind and therefore free us from the bondage of Satan, sin, death, and hell.

应用：世界上很多基督徒都错误的认为耶稣只是另一个聪明的老先知，过去教导他的门徒在生命中做好宝宝，教导他们如何按着十诫生活。如果那是基督来到这个世界的目的，他就是浪费时间，因为我们有父母学校老师告诉我们怎么做好宝宝。诚然，耶稣教导我们如何生活；诚然，耶稣让我们跟随他，遵守十诫。但是他不是耶稣来到这世界的原因。他来到这世界带着毁灭撒旦工作的使命，并且将我们从撒旦的控制下释放出来。他要做的事情是不能被人类所想象出来的。他要在这世代为我们成为罪人的样式，毁灭罪、撒旦、死亡、和地狱。他是我们的赎罪祭，他完全执行律法，并且自愿服在神对罪的惩罚（死亡）下，耶稣愿意将自己放在天父对罪的咒诅下，忍受这个世界对罪人的死的惩罚。他完全的生命和无辜的死亡消除了神对人类的愤怒，因此将我们从撒旦的捆绑、罪、死亡、和地狱中释放出来。

Galatians 4:4,5 But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, 5to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.

加 4:4 ，5 及至时候满足， 神就差遣他的儿子为女子所生，且生在律法以下， 要把律法以下的人赎出来，叫我们得着儿子的名分。

Open up to Leviticus 16 to see an Old Testament picture of forgiveness.打开利未记16章，看一张旧约恕罪的图片。

1. According to verse 1-5, Aaron the high priest was not given free liberty on when he goes to worship. If he went into the Most Holy Place on his own whim we are told that he would die. What do you suppose God was trying to teach the Children of Israel? (Circle one)

    用血作为通道得以进入圣殿的圣所中，神要以此教导他的子民什么？（圈选）

    A. Blood represented the life of a creature and because sin had to be punished, it would take blood to pay for sin.

    血寓表生物的生命，因为罪必得受罚，所以要用血来偿罪。

    B. If you do the best you can in life, you can get into heaven by being a really good person.

    如果你一生努力做好事，你就会因为是个好人而最终进入天堂。

    C. God’s not that serious about certain sins we commit as long as we don’t commit the really big sins in life.

    只要我们生命中没有什么特别重大的罪，神是不会那么严格查看我们所犯的某些罪的。

4. Read verses 20-22. After Aaron confessed the sins of the people “on the goat’s head,” what was to happen to that goat?

    读20-22节。在亚伦将两手按在羊头上，承认罪之后，将会怎样处置这只羊？

5. Who does the goat out in the wilderness represent?

    这只被带到无人之地的羊寓表了谁？

14. What was God trying to demonstrate to his people through this action?

    通过这个仪式神想要对他的子民说明什么？ ---------------------------------

    clip-image016

    Some helpful passages: 有用的经文

    Micah 7:19 You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.

    弥 7:19 必再怜悯我们，将我们的罪孽踏在脚下！又将我们的一切罪投于深海。

16. How did God’s Old Testament Children Picture their forgiveness in the future Savior that was still coming into the world? 

    旧约中神的儿女如何描绘将来的救主的赦免？

    A. God would be merciful provided that they were obedient to him

    如果他们都顺服他，神就满有恩惠。

    B. God would forgive their sins as long as they were faithful to him

    只要他们信神，他们的罪就会得赦免。

    C. God would unconditionally remove their sins from them and never call those sins back against them

    上帝会无条件拿走他们的罪，并且永不让这些罪再归到他们头上。

    Psalm 103:For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; 12 as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.

    诗 103:11 天离地何等地高，他的慈爱向敬畏他的人，也是何等地大。诗 103:12 东离西有多远，他叫我们的过犯，离我们也有多远。

17. As an Old Testament Believer waited for Jesus to come and fulfill God’s promise to save them, how would they understand God’s forgiveness to them based on the words of this Psalm? (Circle One)

    C. If people repent of their sins God will remove their sins from his people

    如果人类悔改认罪，神会将罪从他的百姓中拿走。

    Hebrews 10:1-4 The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

    来 10:1 律法既是将来美事的影儿，不是本物的真像，总不能藉着每年常献一样的祭物叫那近前来的人得以完全。
    来 10:2 若不然，献祭的事岂不早已止住了吗？因为礼拜的人，良心既被洁净，就不再觉得有罪了。
    来 10:3 但这些祭物是叫人每年想起罪来；
    来 10:4 因为公牛和山羊的血，断不能除罪。

18. What does it mean when the Bible teaches us that all of the Old Testament sacrifices were a shadow of things that were coming…(circle one)

    当圣经教导我们旧约献祭之事只是即将来之事的一个影儿，这是什么意思？（圈选）

    A. It meant that Christians would always have to make sacrifices in order to be forgiven, like Communion or baptism.

    基督徒必须要献祭才能除罪，像圣餐和洗礼一样。

    B. It meant that when Christ came to earth, he stepped out of the shadow of the Old Testament and became the sacrifice of sin for us once and for all.

    当救主来到世上，他走出了旧约的影儿，成为为我们罪一次献上并永远献上的祭物。

    I Peter 3:18a For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God.

    彼前 3:18 因基督也曾一次为罪受苦(“受苦”有古卷作“受死”)，就是义的代替不义的，为要引我们到 神面前。

19. Even though the blood of bulls and the blood of goats can’t take away sins, the person they represented, Jesus Christ, can forgive sins. But what had to happen to Jesus in order for the sins of all humanity to be paid for?

    即使公牛犊的血和山羊的血不能除罪，但他们所寓表的那个人，耶稣基督，能够赦免我们的罪。但是为了偿还全人类的罪，耶稣基督将会怎样？

20. Why did he have to die? 为什么他必须死亡？

    Luke 23:44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. For the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.

    路 23:44 那时约有午正，遍地都黑暗了，直到申初，
    路 23:45 日头变黑了；殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。
    路 23:46 耶稣大声喊着说：“父啊！我将我的灵魂交在你手里。”说了这话，气就断了。

21. What did the tearing of the temple curtain signify? 殿里裂开的幔子代表什么？

    Hebrews 10:19,22 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, … let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith…

    来 10:19 弟兄们，我们既因耶稣的血得以坦然进入至圣所，
    来 10:22 并我们心中天良的亏欠已经洒去，身体用清水洗净了，就当存着诚心和充足的信心来到 神面前；

22. Why didn’t the Children of Israel have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place of the Temple and approach God anytime they wanted to approach him?

    为什么以色列的子民没有信心进入至圣所，随时想就近神就就近神呢？

    Where does God’s holy place dwell now? Read the following… 神的圣所现在在哪里？请往下读……

    John 4:19-24 "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet. 20Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."  21Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. 22You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. 23Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. 24God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."."

    约 4:19 妇人说：“先生，我看出你是先知。
    约 4:20 我们的祖宗在这山上礼拜，你们倒说，应当礼拜的地方是在耶路撒冷。”
    约 4:21 耶稣说：“妇人，你当信我。时候将到，你们拜父，也不在这山上，也不在耶路撒冷。
    约 4:22 你们所拜的，你们不知道；我们所拜的，我们知道，因为救恩是从犹太人出来的。
    约 4:23 时候将到，如今就是了，那真正拜父的，要用心灵和诚实拜他，因为父要这样的人拜他。”
    约 4:24 神是个灵(或无“个”字)所以拜他的，必须用心灵和诚实拜他。

Application: God gives us the confidence to approach him anytime and anyplace because of the blood of Jesus has brought us back to a right relationship with God.

应用：神给我们信心让我们随时随地亲近他，因为基督的血使我们又与神和好了。


### III. GOD REVEALS HIMSELF TO US IN THE BIBLE: 上帝在圣经中向我们启示他自己

clip-image021

Isaiah 45:22 Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God and there is no other.
赛 45:22 “地极的人都当仰望我，就必得救；因为我是 神，再没有别神。

1. How many Gods does the true God reveal himself as?

    神揭示真神有多少位？

    Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…

    太 28:19 所以，你们要去使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗(或作“给他们施洗，归于父子圣灵的名。”)。

2. How many persons does the one true God reveal himself as? 这位独一真神向多少人彰显他自己？

    John 14:8 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.”

    约 14:8 腓力对他说：“求主将父显给我们看，我们就知足了。” 约 14:9 耶稣对他说：“腓力！我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父；你怎么说，‘将父显给我们看’呢？

3. God has revealed himself most clearly in the person of -----------

    神在（ ）中最清楚的显明了他自己。

    John 5:37-39 And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me.

    约 5:37 差我来的父也为我作过见证。你们从来没有听见他的声音，也没有看见他的形象；
    约 5:38 你们并没有他的道存在心里，因为他所差来的，你们不信。
    约 5:39 你们查考圣经(或作“应当查考圣经”)，因你们以为内中有永生；给我作见证的就是这经；

Application: There are over 300 direct fulfillment’s of Old Testament prophecy in regards to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and there are close to a 1,000 indirect prophecies regarding his work. It’s important that we see Jesus in our studies of the Old Testament because Jesus is the fulfillment of everything written from the Old Testament. The Jewish people predominantly rejected Jesus because they failed to see him as the fulfillment of all the Old Testament rituals and sacrifices.

应用：旧约有300多个直接预言已经兑现，涉及到耶稣基督的生命、死亡和再来。还有大约1000左右非直接的关系到他工作的预言。在我们学习旧约时，我们眼望耶稣是非常重要的事，因为耶稣是旧约所有记载的完成者。犹太人拒绝了耶稣，因为他们没有看到他是旧约所有仪文献祭的成全者。

### IV. WHAT DOES THE BIBLE TEACH US ABOUT GOD’S DESIRE FOR US? 圣经教导我们神对我们有什么渴望？

Leviticus 19:2 Speak to the entire assembly of Israel and say to them: ‘Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.

利 19:2 “你晓谕以色列全会众说：你们要圣洁，因为我耶和华你们的 神是圣洁的。

Matthew 5:48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

太 5:48 所以你们要完全，象你们的天父完全一样。”

I Peter 1:15 But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;

彼前 1:15 那召你们的既是圣洁，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁；

1. What does a holy God demand from sinners? (Circle one)圣洁的神要求罪人什么？（圈选）

    a. Do the best we can 努力做到最好

    b. Perfectly love him with all our heart, soul, and mind and perfectly love our neighbor as ourselves.尽心尽性尽意地爱他，爱邻舍如同爱自己。

    Romans 3:9-12 What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin. As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”

    罗 3:9 这却怎么样呢？我们比他们强吗？决不是的！因我们已经证明：犹太人和希腊人都在罪恶之下。
    罗 3:10 就如经上所记：“没有义人，连一个也没有；
    罗 3:11 没有明白的，没有寻求 神的；
    罗 3:12 都是偏离正路，一同变为无用；没有行善的，连一个也没有。

2. Who is Paul saying that fits this description in these verses? 谁符合保罗在这几节经文里所描述的？---------------------

Exodus 34:6 And he (God) passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.
出34:6 耶和华在他面前宣告说：“耶和华，耶和华，是有怜悯有恩典的 神，不轻易发怒，并有丰盛的慈爱和诚实。

1. What picture of God do we see in this passage?

    这节经文中我们看到了神的什么？

    I John 4:8 …God is love. This is how God showed his love among us; He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

    约一 4:8 没有爱心的，就不认识 神，因为 神就是爱。
    约一 4:9 神差他独生子到世间来，使我们藉着他得生， 神爱我们的心在此就显明了。
    约一 4:10 不是我们爱 神，乃是 神爱我们，差他的儿子为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。

2. A holy God couldn’t overlook our sins, but a forgiving God didn’t want to punish us. How did God solve this problem?

    圣洁的神不能忽视我们的罪，但是满有宽容的神却不想惩罚我们。神如何解决这个问题？

    II Corinthians 5:21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

    林后 5:21 神使那无罪的(“无罪”原文作“不知罪”)，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为 神的义。

    Through faith in Jesus Christ, God has taken our sins and laid them upon Jesus, and has credited the perfect life of Jesus to our sinful lives. And therefore the saying is true: simul iustus et peccatur = Same time just; same time sinner or 100% sinner according to the flesh and 100% saint by the blood of Jesus.

    通过信耶稣基督，神除掉了我们的罪并将它们都归在耶稣身上，以耶稣完全的生命来抵偿了我们罪恶的生命。因此，这样的说法是真实的：simul iustus et peccatur = 我们既是义人又是罪人，即肉体上讲是100%的罪人，因基督耶稣的宝血又是100%义人。
