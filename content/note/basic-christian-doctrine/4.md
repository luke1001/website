第三课(LESSON #3 ) 律法，福音，信心，称义

HOPE GROWS AS WE LEARN HOW GOD SPEAKS TO US THROUGH HIS WORD!
神通过圣经对我们说话，当我们学习他的话语时，希望就增长！
Law, Gospel, Faith, Justification.
律法，福音，信心，称义
The two teachings in the Bible consist of God’s Law and God’s Gospel. Both teachings are beneficial and useful to God’s people. Properly understanding these two teachings is vital for our salvation!
神的律法和神的福音是圣经中的两大教导。神的子民从这两个教导中同受裨益。正确理解这两个教导，对我们的救赎至关重要。

Luke 18:9-14
9To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: 10"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
13"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
14"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
路加福音18:9-14
18:9 耶稣向那些仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，
18:10 说：“有两个人上殿里去祷告：一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。
18:11 法利赛人站着，自言自语地祷告说：‘ 神啊，我感谢你，我不像别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不像这个税吏。
18:12 我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的都捐上十分之一。
18:13 那税吏远远地站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：‘ 神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！’
18:14 我告诉你们：这人回家去比那人倒算为义了。因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。”
1. Jesus teaches us about the Law and the Gospel in the story of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector. Explain the moral of the story by answering the following questions…
1.在这个法利赛人与税吏的故事中，耶稣教导了有关律法与福音的信息。回答下列问题，解释故事中的属灵教训。
a. What moved Jesus to tell the story?
a.耶稣讲这个故事的用意是什么？
b. Why did Jesus choose a Pharisee and a tax collector for his story?
b.耶稣为什么要选择一个法利赛人和一个税吏作他故事的主角？
c. Which man went away justified and why?
c. 哪一个人在离开的时候被称为义，为什么？
Justification = To Declare innocent. When you hear the word justify, think of a court room scene where God is seated as the Judge of all mankind. Because of sin, the whole world is held accountable for sin and therefore deserving of God’s eternal displeasure in the Kingdom of hell. However, because God imputed or transferred the whole world’s sins upon Jesus Christ, we are told in the Bible that God has universally justified all of his creation. Sadly the results of justification, though given to the whole world, can be rejected by mankind.
称义=宣布无罪。当你听到“称义”这个词时，想一想法庭的场景。神是全人类的法官。因为罪，所有的人都必须为自己所犯的罪承担责任，因此必须承受神的审判，那就是永远的地狱之苦。然而，因为神把全世界人的罪都转移到了耶稣基督身上，或者说归咎于耶稣基督，所以，圣经告诉我们，神已经使他所有的创造物都称义了。可悲的是，尽管称义是赐给全世界的人，却被人拒绝。
Bible passages:
圣经经文：
1 John 2:2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
约一2:2他为我们的罪作了挽回祭．不是单为我们的罪、也是为普天下人的罪。
1. Do you remember the picture of God’s forgiveness in the Old Testament on the Day of Atonement when Aaron the high Priest was to confess all of the sins of the people upon the goat’s head and then release the scapegoat out into the wilderness? Well, John now calls Jesus the “Atoning” sacrifice, which brings to mind that great Day of Atonement when God objectively forgave the sins of the people of Israel. Only John tells us that Jesus forgave not just the sins of audience that John was writing to (a Christian church), but whose sins did Jesus forgive?
1．你记得神在旧约中施行饶恕的情景吗？在赎罪日那一天，大祭司亚伦为所有的人认罪，把它们归于山羊的头上，然后又把这个替罪的山羊放逐旷野。现在，约翰把耶稣称为“赎罪”的祭物。这让我们想到那个重要的赎罪日，神在那一天真正地饶恕了以色列人全会众的罪恶。另外，约翰告诉我们，耶稣不仅饶恕了那些约翰信中所指的人（一个基督教会）的罪，那么，耶稣还饶恕了哪些人的罪呢？
clip-image0062 Corinthians 5:19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
林后5：19 这就是神在基督里叫世人与自己和好，不将他们的过犯归到他们身上，并且将这和好的道理托付了我们。
2. Agree or Disagree: God must count the sins of unbelievers against them because otherwise unbelievers would not go to hell when they die and the Bible clearly teaches that unbelievers go to hell.
2. 同意还是不同意：神必须要定不信者的罪，否则在他们离开这个世界以后就不会下地狱。而圣经清楚教导，不信的人要下地狱。
John 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”
约1：29次日，约翰看见耶稣来到他那里，就说，看哪，神的羔羊，除去（或作背负）世人罪孽的。
3. Agree or Disagree: People who die in unbelief are not condemned to hell because of their sins, but rather because of their unbelief and refusal to receive God’s gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
3. 同意还是不同意：不信的人死了以后下地狱，并不是因为他们的罪，而是因为他们不信，并且拒绝神透过相信耶稣基督赐给他们的救恩。
Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
罗3：23因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了 神的荣耀；
3：24如今却蒙 神的恩典，因基督耶稣的救赎，就白白地称义。
4. Agree or Disagree: This passage teaches us that God has declared the whole world - believers and unbelievers alike – innocent through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ.
4. 同意还是不同意：此处的经文教导我们，神已经透过耶稣基督的救赎工作，宣告整个世界的人无罪—无论是信他的还是不信的。
Acts 7:51 "You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!
徒7：51 你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵；你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样！
5. Agree or disagree: The Bible teaches us that while a person cannot come to faith in Jesus by his own thinking or choosing, a person can reject and despise the gift of salvation that God has given for the whole world.
5. 同意还是不同意：圣经教导我们，尽管一个人不能靠着自己的心意或选择而相信耶稣，却可能拒绝和藐视神赐给全世界的救恩礼物。
Ephesians 2:8,9 8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9not by works, so that no one can boast.10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
弗2:8 你们是靠上帝的恩典、凭信心而得救的；这不是出于你们自己的行为，而是上帝的恩赐。
2:9 既然不是靠行为，你们就没有什么好夸口的。
2:10 上帝是我们的创造者；他藉着基督耶稣改造了我们，要我们行善；这是他早已 计划要我们去做的。
6. Agree or disagree: Because salvation and faith are mostly God’s works and partly a person’s work, we therefore say “It is by grace we are saved!”
6. 同意还是不同意：因为救恩和信心绝大部分是神的作为，仅仅一部分是人的作为，因此，我们说：“我们是靠恩典得救的”。
1 Corinthians 10:12,13 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! 13No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.
林前10:12 所以，自己以为站得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒。
10:13 你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。 神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。
7. According to the Bible, can someone who has faith in Jesus actually lose their faith and fall away from Christianity?
7. 根据圣经，一个相信耶稣的人真地会因为失去信心而从基督教里失落吗？
8. If a Christian falls away from faith, who does the Bible say is at fault?
8. 如果一个基督徒失去信心，圣经里说这是谁的错？
clip-image008Application: The Bible teaches that if a man is saved, it is completely and entirely the grace of God, through the working of the Holy Spirit and the Gospel, and therefore it is only by grace that we are saved. The Bible also teaches that mankind begins this world despising and rejecting God and that God must reconstruct the heart and bring it to faith. The Bible also teaches that after a person comes to faith in Jesus, he can still turn his back on God and despise the gift of salvation. The Law and the Gospel are the tools by which God leads us to repentance of our sins and a trust in his Savior for our salvation.
应用：圣经教导，如果一个人得到救恩，这完完全全是神的恩典，
透过圣灵和福音在做工。因此，我们得救只是靠神的恩典。
圣经也教导，人类从最初就藐视神、拒绝神，因此，神必须重新建造人的心灵，
使她可以相信。圣经还教导，当一个人相信耶稣以后，他还可能会
背弃神，藐视救恩的礼物。律法和福音是神使用的工具，引导我们
认罪悔改，相信救主而得着救恩。
Jesus sums up the first three commandments, or the First Table of the Law, by saying this:
耶稣用以下的经文归纳了前三条诫命，或者说第一项律法：
Matthew 22:37 “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”
太22：37 耶稣对他说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主你的神。 ”
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
第一条诫命
THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.
除我以外，你不可有别的神。
THE BIBLE SAYS
圣经说:
Isaiah 42:8 “I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols.”
赛42:8 我是耶和华，这是我的名。我必不将我的荣耀归给假神，也不将我的称赞归给雕刻的偶像。
1. What is an idol?
1. 偶像是什么？
2. How does a Christian apply this commandment to his/her life?
2. 一个基督徒怎样把这条诫命应用在自己的生活中？
THE SECOND COMMANDMENT
第二条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD, THY GOD, IN VAIN.
不可妄称耶和华你上帝的名。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Leviticus 19:31 “Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.”

利19:31 不可偏向那些交鬼的和行巫术的；不可求问他们，以致被他们玷污了。我是耶和华你们的 神。

Matthew15: 8 “These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.”
太15：8「这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。」
1. How were God’s children supposed to use his name?
1. 神的儿女应该怎样使用他的名？
2. How does a Christian apply this commandment to his/her life?
2. 一个基督徒怎样把这条诫命应用在自己的生活中？
Application for Christian:
基督徒的应用：
Cursing, swearing, lying, and deceiving, using God’s name superstitiously, giving God lip-service in our prayers and worship, not thanking the Lord when we receive gifts from his hands, and not calling upon him in the day of trouble are all ways in which we misuse our gracious Lord’s name.
诅咒、起誓、撒谎、欺骗、迷信地使用神的名、在祷告和敬拜中只在口头上敷衍、接受神的礼物但并不感谢他、在危难的日子不向他呼求，这些都是我们在滥用神恩典的圣名。
THE THIRD COMMANDMENT
第三条诫命
REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY.
当纪念安息日，守为圣日。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Luke 14:1-6 1One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. 2There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy. 3Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?" 4But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away. 5Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?" 6And they had nothing to say.
路14：1-6
14：1安息日，耶稣到一个法利赛人的首领家里去吃饭，他们就窥探他。
14：2在他面前有一个患水臌的人。
14：3耶稣对律法师和法利赛人说：“安息日治病可以不可以？”
14：4他们却不言语。耶稣就治好那人，叫他走了。
14：5便对他们说：“你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉它上来呢？”
14：6他们不能对答这话

1. What was the Sabbath day?
1. 什么是安息日？
Matthew 12:8 “For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
太 12：8因为人子是安息日的主。
- Because Jesus was the “Lord of the Sabbath,” he had the authority to overrule laws concerning the Sabbath, particularly the laws interpreted by the Pharisees.
-因为耶稣是“安息日的主”，他有权柄改变有关安息日的律法，尤其是法利赛人所理解的律法。
Colossians 2:16,17 “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.”
西 2：16 所以不拘在饮食上，或节期、月朔、安息日，都不可让人论断你们。
2：17 这些原是后事的影儿，那形体却是基督。
2. Some churches teach that the Sabbath Day is still to be kept and we must worship on Saturdays. What would you say based on the Bible passage from Colossians 2:16,17?
2. 一些教会教导，安息日还必须要遵守，所以我们必须在星期六敬拜。根据歌罗西书2:16,17，你会怎么说？
Psalm 26:8 “I love the house where you live, O Lord, the place where your glory dwells.”
诗篇26:8 耶和华啊，我喜爱你所住的殿和你显荣耀的居所。
- As New Testament Christians, we still ought to love and honor the house in which the Word of God is taught and the sacraments of Christ are administered.
--作为新约时代的基督徒，我们仍然应该喜爱并尊荣教导神话语的居所，
以及施行基督圣礼的处所。
clip-image009
Jesus sums up the last seven commandments, or the Second Table of the Law, by saying this:
耶稣用以下的经文归纳了后七条诫命，或者说第二项律法：
Matthew 22:39 “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
太22:39 、“要爱邻舍如同自己。”
THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
第四条诫命
THOU SHALT HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH THEE AND THOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
当孝敬父母，使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐你的地上得以长久。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Proverbs 30:17 “The eye that mocks a father, that scorns obedience to a mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.”
箴30：17戏笑父亲，藐视而不听从母亲的，他的眼睛，必为谷中的乌鸦啄出来，为鹰雏所吃。
I Peter 2:18 “Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.”
彼前 2:18 你们作仆人的，凡事要存敬畏的心顺服主人。不但顺服那善良温和的，就是那乖僻的也要顺服。
Application: The fourth commandment is self-explanatory for children to obey their earthly parents, assuming those earthly parents are God-fearing and not exasperating or harming those children. However, the commandment’s application extends to a broader audience of people—all those in authority. We are to serve and obey the government, our pastors and teachers and employers. But when authority is abused or misguided we also have this application from Scripture: Acts 5:29 “We must obey God rather than men!”
应用：第四条诫命要求儿女服从地上的父母，这不解自明。其前提是他们在地上的父母都敬畏神、不惹儿女的气、不伤害他们。然而，应用这条诫命时，它的听众却可以延伸至更广的人群：所有有权柄的人。我们应该服务而且顺服政府、我们的牧师、教师以及我们的雇主。但是当权柄被滥用或被误导时，我们也可采纳圣经使徒行传5：29“彼得和众使徒回答说：“顺从 神，不顺从人，是应当的！”

THE FITH COMMANDMENT
第五条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT MURDER.
不可杀人。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Genesis 9:6 “Whosoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed.”
创9：6 凡 流 人 血 的 ， 他 的 血 也 必 被 人 所 流 。 因为 神 造 人 是 照 自 己 的 形 像 造 的 。

I John 3:15 “Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life.”
约一3：15 凡恨他弟兄的，就是杀人的。你们晓得凡杀人的，没有永生存在他里面。
1. Agree or Disagree: According to the Bible’s definition of murder, anyone who has been angry with another person is condemned by God as a murderer and therefore not qualified to go to heaven because of this sin.
1. 同意还是不同意：根据圣经对杀人的定义，任何一个人如果对另一个人生气，他已经被神定为杀人犯。因此，他便因为这个罪而不能进天堂。
THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT
第六条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.
不可奸淫。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Genesis 39:9 “No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”
创39：9 在 这 家 里 没 有 比 我 大 的 。 并 且 他 没 有 留 下 一 样 不 交 给 我 ， 只 留 下 了 你 ， 因为 你 是 他 的 妻 子 。 我 怎 能 作 这 大 恶 ， 得 罪 神 呢 ？
· Joseph spoke these words when Potiphar’s wife tried to sleep with Joseph. If Joseph gave in to this temptation he would have committed a wicked sin against God. A sin that the Bible calls adultery.
· 约瑟说这些话，是在波提乏的妻子试图与他同寝的时候。如果约瑟屈服于这个试探，他就已经犯了一件可恶的罪而得罪神。一个圣经称为奸淫的罪。
Matthew 5:28 “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”
太5：28 只是我告诉你们、凡看见妇女就动淫念的、这人心里已经与他犯奸淫了
Application: Once again, the Bible reminds us that God is very interested in what takes place in our hearts and in our minds, well before the sin occurs from our bodies. By Jesus standards, a person is guilty of adultery even if the act is not carried out!
应用：圣经再一次提醒我们，神非常注重发生在我们心里、头脑里的事情，早在罪发生在我们身上之前。按照耶稣的标准，即使奸淫的行为还没有发生的时候，一个人就已经犯了奸淫罪了！
THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT
第七条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.
不可偷盗
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Jeremiah 22:13 “Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his countrymen work for nothing, not paying them for their labor.”
耶22:13 那行不义盖房，行不公造楼，白白使用人的手工不给工价的有祸了。
II Thessalonians 3:10 “If a man will not work, he shall not eat.”
帖后3：10 我们在你们那里的时候，曾吩咐你们说，若有人不肯作工，就不可吃饭。
1. Stealing goes far beyond these two passages. Can you list some other ways that we can apply this commandment?
1. 涉及偷窃的经文远非这两处。你能列出应用这条诫命的其他方面吗？
THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT
第八条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST THY NEIGHBOR.
不可作假见证陷害人。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Proverbs 19:5 “A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who pours out lies will not go free.”
箴19： 5 作假见证的，必不免受罚。吐出谎言的，终不能逃脱。
James 4:11a “Brothers, do not slander one another.”
雅各书4：11上- 弟兄们，你们不可彼此批评。
I Timothy 5:13 (speaking to younger widows) “Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.”
提前5：13（向年轻的寡妇说）「并且她们又习惯懒惰，挨家闲游；不但是懒惰，又说长道短，好管闲事，说些不当说的话」。
Application: If we aren’t building someone up, we’re often tearing that person or company down. God’s Word teaches us that talking behind someone’s back or giving someone a bad reputation is destructive and sinful. There’s an old saying that states: “If you don’t have something good to say; then don’t say it at all.” As we consider the sins of the tongue, we can see just how dangerous it can be as a weapon against others.
应用：如果我们没有在造就一个人，我们就常常在拆毁一个人或一群人。神的话教导我们，背后说人，或者毁坏别人的名誉都带有毁灭性的效果，是罪的表现。有句古话说：“如果你没有良善的话可说，就干脆什么都别说！” 在我们思想舌头可能犯的罪时，我们看到，舌头作为一个攻击人的武器，它可能会非常危险。
THE NINTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS
第九和第十条诫命
THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE.
不可贪恋人的房屋
THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR’S WIFE, NOR HIS MANSERVANT, NOR HIS MAIDSERVANT, NOR HIS CATTLE, NOR ANYTHING THAT IS THY NEIGHBOR’S.
也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说:
I Timothy 6:8-10 “But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.”
提前 6:8 只要有衣有食，就当知足。
6：9 但那些想要发财的人，就陷在迷惑、落在网罗和许多无知有害的私欲 里，叫人沉在败坏和灭亡中。
6：10 贪财是万恶之根！有人贪恋钱财，就被引诱离了真道，用许多愁苦把 自己刺透了。
Application: Desiring more and better in life, in work, with our families etc. often springs forth from a discontented heart. There is a saying in America that goes, “The grass is greener on the other side of the fence,” implying that a person should always be searching for more…more…more. But this proverb couldn’t be farther from the truth. Sadly, many people who are dissatisfied with their marriages and their careers and the amount of money they make find out the hard lesson in life that the grass is not always greener on the other side. God calls us to repent of discontentment and learn to rely on his grace when it comes to our shortcomings and weaknesses in life.
应用：在生活、工作、家庭里渴望得到更多、更好的东西，这种心态往往源于一颗不满足的心。美国人有句谚语：“篱笆那一边的草总是更绿些。”意思是人应该不断追求得到更多---更多---更多。但是这句谚语却远离事实真相。令人感到可悲的是，许多对婚姻、事业和得到的钱财不满足的人，得出了人生的教训—篱笆那一边的草并不总是更绿。神呼召我们为自己的不满足认罪悔改，要我们在生活中遇到缺乏和软弱时，学习仰赖他的恩典。
Summary of the Ten Commandments: The Bible teaches us that a person can enter heaven one of two ways: They can either enter heaven by keeping all of the commandments perfectly or they can enter heaven by looking in faith to God’s Son, our Savior who satisfied God’s demands of the Law for us and took our punishment of death in our place. Unfortunately there are far too many in this world that reject God’s gift to us and instead try to earn their salvation through the keeping of the Law. May we resolve to look to the Law fulfiller (Jesus) for our salvation, and repent of our sins and trust God’s mercy to us in Christ Jesus.
归纳十条诫命：圣经教导我们，人有两条路可以进天堂：一条是靠完美地遵行所有的诫命；另一条是通过信心仰望神的儿子、我们的救主。他为我们满足了神律法的要求，替我们承担了死亡的刑罚。不幸的是，世界上有太多的人拒绝神给我们的礼物，而试图通过遵行律法来赢得救恩。愿我们都能仰望那位为了我们得救而完美遵行了律法的耶稣，悔改自己的罪，信靠神在耶稣基督里对我们的怜悯。
clip-image011Luke 10:25-29 25On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 26"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?" 27He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" 28"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live." 29But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?”
路10：25 有一个律法师起来试探耶稣，说：“夫子，我该做什么才可以承受永生？”
10：26 耶稣对他说：“律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？”
10：27 他回答说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的 神；又要爱邻舍如同自己。”
10：28 耶稣说：“你回答的是。你这样行，就必得永生。
10：29 那人要显明自己有理，就对耶稣说：“谁是我的邻舍呢？”
1. When Jesus told the expert in the law, “Do this and you will live,” was Jesus suggesting that a person can actually get to heaven without God’s help or was he telling the man that hypothetically if you could do this, then you could also have life with God in heaven?
1.当耶稣对律法的专家说：“你这样行，就必得永生。”耶稣的意思是一个人能够不需要神的帮助就能真正地进入天堂；还是他在假设，一个人只有做到这些，他才可以在天上与神同享永生？
Read the parable of the Good Samaritan and then consider why Jesus chose to tell this story to the expert in the law.
读好撒玛利亚人的比喻，思考耶稣为什么要选择向律法教师讲这个故事。
Luke 10:30-37 30In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. 35The next day he took out two silver coins[e] and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' 36"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" 37The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."
路10:30 耶稣回答说：“有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去，落在强盗手中。他们剥去他的衣裳，把他打个半死，就丢下他走了。
10：31 偶然有一个祭司从这条路下来，看见他就从那边过去了。

All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.”

- God’s Word reveals to us 3 uses of the Law:
神的话向我们揭示了律法的3方面用途：
Mirror – Most important use because it shows me the reflection of myself in God’s eyes – a sinner in need of a Savior!
镜子—这是最重要的用途，因为它让我看见我在神眼中的反
照：一个罪人，需要救主！
Romans 3:20 “Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.”
罗3：20所以凡有血气的，没有一个因行律法能在 神面前称 义，因为律法本是叫人知罪。
clip-image015Curb – This use of the law tries to prevent people from committing really bad sins, and it also makes people think twice before they do something terrible and it also protects us from evil people in the world. Think of person driving late at night and falls asleep behind the wheel, the curb or guard rail is there to wake him up so that something really harmful doesn’t happen to that person.
约束、管制—律法的这个功用是要阻止人犯下极其严重的罪行。它也会使人在作恶之前去三思。还可以保护我们免受世界上恶人的伤害。试想一个在深夜驾车行驶的人，因为抵不住瞌睡的诱惑而睡着。路沿处的护栏可以让他醒来，也免了一场严重的事故发生。
I Timothy 1:9-11 “We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers – and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.”
提前1:9 因为律法不是为义人设立的，乃是为不法和不服的，不虔诚和犯罪的，不圣洁和恋世俗的，弑父母和杀人的，
1：10行淫和亲男色的，抢人口和说谎话的，并起假誓的，或是为别样敌正道的事设立的。
1：11这是照着可称颂之 神交托我荣耀福音说的。
clip-image017Guide – This use of the law is for Christians only, because only the Christian can properly please God. For the Bible states, “Without faith it is impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6). Think of how a referee uses a rule book to determine how a game can be fairly played between two teams. In a similar way, God’s children have God’s rule book, the Holy Bible to help them understand the will of their heavenly Father for the purpose of pleasing their heavenly Father. Recognize that the guide is never enough for us to work our way to heaven.
指引—律法的这一用途只适用于基督徒。因为只有基督徒才能真正得神的喜悦。圣经说：“人非有信，就不能得神的喜悦。”（来11：6）试想一位裁判员，拿着一本裁判指南，要判定两队的比赛怎样才能 赛得公平。同样，神的儿女也拿着神的生命指南-圣经，来帮助他们明白天父的旨意，知道怎样让天父喜悦。要知道，在行走天路的历程中，永远都需要圣经的指引。
Romans 7:7 “What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”
罗7：7这样，我们可说甚么呢？律法是罪吗？断乎不是！只是非因律法，我就不知何为罪。非律法说『不可起贪心』，我就不知何为贪心。
THE BIBLE SAYS –
圣经说：
Romans 10:4 “Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.”
罗10:4 律法的总结就是基督，使凡信他的都得着义。

1. In what way is Christ the “end” of the law?
1. 基督在哪些方面是律法的“总结”（终结）？
Galatians 3:13 “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”
加3：13基督既为我们受了咒诅（注：“受”原文作“成”），就 赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅，因为经上记着：“凡挂在木头上是被咒诅的。”
Summary: The whole world has been condemned by God according to the Law; but according to the good news of the Gospel, the Bible teaches us that God condemned his Son in our place so that all who look to Jesus by FAITH have been set free from the consequence of sin, which is death.
总结：根据律法，全世界的人都已受到了神的审判；然而，圣经教 导我们，根据福音的好消息，神让他的儿子代替我们受罚，使所有凭信心而仰望耶稣的人，就从罪的严重后果-死亡中得到释放。

OUR SAVIOR’S GOSPEL INVITATIONS -
我们救主的福音邀请：
Matthew 11:28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest…you will find rest for your souls.”
太11：28凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。
clip-image023John 7:37 “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink…streams of living water will flow from within him.”
约7:37 节期的末日、就是最大之日、耶稣站着高声说、人若渴了、可以到我这里来喝。
Revelation 22:17 “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.”
启22：17圣灵和新妇都说：“来！”听见的人也该说：“来！”口渴的人也当来；愿意的，都可以白白取生命的水喝。
John 4:13 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water (from the well) will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
约4：13
耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 凡 喝 这 水 的 ， 还 要 再 渴。
人 若 喝 我 所 赐 的 水 就 永 远 不 渴 。 我 所 赐的 水 ， 要 在 他 里 头 成 为 泉 源 ， 直 涌 到 永 生 。

clip-image025John 6:35-37 “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”
约6：35-37
35耶稣说，我就是生命的粮。到我这里来的，必定不饿。信我的，永远不渴。
36只是我对你们说过，你们已经看见我，还是不信。
37 凡父所赐给我的人，必到我这里来；到我这里来的，我总不丢弃他。
John 10:27-28 “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.”
约10:27 我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。
clip-image02710:28    我又赐给他们永生。他们永不灭亡，谁也不能从我手里把他们夺去。
“The Law tells us what we are to do. No such instruction is contained in
the Gospel. On the contrary, the Gospel reveals to us only what God is doing. The Law is speaking concerning our works; the Gospel, concerning the great works
of God. The Gospel makes no demands whatever.
律法告诉我们该做的事情。福音中不包含这样的指示。相反，福音向我们揭示的，
只是神在做的事情。律法讲的是有关我们的工作；福音是有关神的伟大作为。
福音不提出任何要求。
But does not the Gospel demand faith? Yes; that, however, is just the same kind of command as when you say to a hungry person, ‘Come, sit down at my table and eat.’ The hungry person will not reply: ‘Bosh! I will not take orders from you.’ No, he will understand and accept your words as a kind invitation. That is what the Gospel is – a kind invitation to partake of heavenly blessings. (The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel. DR. C.F.W. Walther)
但是，福音不要求人有信心吗？是的。不过，那种要求只好比你在对一个饥饿的人说，“来，坐在我的桌旁，吃吧！”那个饥饿的人不会说：“罢了！我为什么要听你的命令呢？”不，他会理解，而且把你的话视为一种善意的邀请，那就是福音—善意地邀请你享受从天而来的祝福。（律法和福音之区别(The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel. DR. C.F.W. Walther)）
