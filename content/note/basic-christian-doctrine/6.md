The Means of Gracealt
恩典的途径
The means of grace are the instruments or tools appointed by God for conveying the righteousness of Jesus Christ to a sinner. Think of a person working in a garden. He/she needs tools to soften the soil before planting the seed. Then, after the ground is tilled and the seeds are planted, a gardener might lightly rake the soil to work the seeds into the ground. In the same way that a gardener uses tools for his soil, God uses tools to deliver his precious message of the gospel to sinners. God uses the Gospel in both Word and Sacrament to create faith in our hearts and to sustain and keep faith alive until he takes us to glory. In future lessons we will take a closer look at those sacred rites of the church, called Sacraments. For our lesson today, however, we will see the creating and sustaining power that God uses on us through his Holy Word.
恩典的途径是指神用来把耶稣基督的公义传送到罪人身上所使用的工具。试想一个在花园里播种的人。在他把种子种到地里之前，他需要工具来先松土、犁地，然后才能播种。播种时，他可能还需要用耙子把地耙平，以便于下种。就像一个花匠需要工具预备土壤一样，神也使用工具把他宝贵的福音信息传递给罪人。神使用圣经以及圣礼当中的福音信息，在我们心里生出信心，并对它加以供养，使我们的信心一直保持到他带我们进入荣耀的日子。有关教会中的神圣仪式（圣礼），我们在以后的课程中会进一步学习。今天的课程主要看神通过他的圣言在我们身上做工时，所具有的伟大创造力和支撑力。

I Corinthians 1:18,23 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. But we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.
林前1:18 因为十字架的道理，在那灭亡的人为愚拙；在我们得救的人却为　神的大能
1:23 我们却是传钉十字架的基督。在犹太人为绊脚石，在外邦人为愚拙；
Read the story of the calling of Matthew, a disciple of Jesus and react to Paul’s words about the “cross being foolish to those who are perishing.”
读耶稣呼召马太作门徒的故事，思想保罗的话：“十字架的道理，在那灭亡的人为愚拙”。
alt
Luke 5:27-32 27After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him, 28and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. 29Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. 30But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and 'sinners'?" 31Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
路5：27-32
5:27 这事以后，耶稣出去，看见一个税吏，名叫利未，坐在税关上，就对他说：“你跟从我来！”
5:28 他就撇下所有的，起来，跟从了耶稣。
5:29 利未在自己家里为耶稣大摆筵席，有许多税吏和别人与他们一同坐席。
5:30 法利赛人和文士就向耶稣的门徒发怨言说：“你们为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃喝呢？”
5:31 耶稣对他们说：“无病的人用不着医生，有病的人才用得着；
5:32 我来本不是召义人悔改，乃是召罪人悔改。”
1. Relate Jesus’ words, “I have not come to call the righteous…” with the words of Paul, “The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing.”
1. 结合耶稣的话:“我来不是召义人---”；思想保罗的话：“十字架的道理，在那灭亡的人为愚拙；”
I Corinthians 2:14 “The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.”
林前2:14 然而，属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。
2． Faith is the instrument, by which God communicates his saving love to the hearts of his children. Why does the world laugh at Christianity and reject its message according to 1 Corinthians 2:14?
2. 信心是一个管道。神借着这个管道，把他的救赎之爱输送到他儿女的心里。根据林前2：14，这个世界为什么取笑基督教，并拒绝其中的信息？
Ephesians 2:1 “As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,”
弗2：1 你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。
（从前，你们因犯罪违抗上帝的命令，你们在灵性上是死了。）
3． How does a person begin life? (Circle one)
3. 一个人的生命在开始时的情形是怎样的？ （选择）
a.Spiritually dead b. Spiritually alive
a. 灵是死的 b. 灵是活着的
Acts 17:6,18 (6) But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, (18) A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
徒17：6，18
17：6 找不着他们，就把耶孙和几个弟兄拉到地方官那里，喊叫说：“那搅乱天下的也到这里来了！
17：18 还有伊壁鸠鲁和斯多亚两门的学士与他争论。有的说：“这胡言乱语的要说什么？”有的说：“他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。”这话是因保罗传讲耶稣与复活的道。
4． Why couldn’t these people understand what Paul was saying?
4. 这些人为什么不明白保罗的话？
Summary: Since man is ignorant and blind by nature, the Bible reveals to us that God comes to us through the gentle voice of the gospel in order to shatter the pride of unbelief and cause a conversion to take place in an unbeliever’s heart.
小结： 因为人生性无知、瞎眼，圣经向我们揭示，神借助福音的微小声音来到我们中间，为要粉碎不信的骄傲势力，在不信者心中生出信心。

II Corinthians 5:18-21 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
林后5：18-21
5:18 一切都是出于　神，他藉着基督使我们与他和好，又将劝人与他和好的职分赐给我们。
5:19 这就是　神在基督里叫世人与自己和好，不将他们的过犯归到他们身上，并且将这和好的道理托付了我们。
5:20 所以，我们作基督的使者，就好像　神藉我们劝你们一般。我们替基督求你们与　神和好。

6． Where are the disciples, and therefore every Christian supposed to take this message of grace?
6. 耶稣的门徒和每一位基督徒应该把这个恩典的信息带到哪里？
Summary: God has put his message of salvation through the cross of Jesus on display for the whole world to see and to believe. If they believe and confess Jesus as Lord and Savior, it is all the hand of God working through the powerful message of the gospel.
If they deny and reject what they see on display from the hand of God, the Bible is clear that it is their fault. God gets the credit for faith; man gets the blame for unbelief.
小结：神将耶稣的十字架展示给全世界，让人们看到并且相信他救恩的好消息。如果他们相信并接受耶稣作他们的主并救赎主，这完全是神通过大能的福音信息在他们里面做工的结果。如果他们不相信，并且拒绝神展示在他们眼前的救恩，圣经清楚地指出，这是他们自己的错误。相信使神得荣耀，不信只能怪自己。
Martin Luther, the leader of the Reformation from the 1500’s once commented that the gospel is very much like a rain shower. It stops over a certain area for a while and richly blesses it with moisture, refreshing the countryside, greening all the foliage, and raising the crops. But then the shower passes on to another location,and the place once blessed by it begins to dry up.
马丁路德，1500年时期的改革家曾经说，福音很像是一场阵雨。一段时间，它会在某个地方停留，降下祝福的雨水，使乡村得到滋润，树叶变得鲜绿，庄稼得以生长。另一段时间，它又会转移到其它地方。先前得到雨祝福过的土地又开始变干。

Summary: It is extremely important that we at this time recognize that the power of God’s Word is alive and powerful. Unlike reading a novel, or
an interesting autobiography, when the Holy Bible is read, the Holy Spirit is at work creating and sustaining our faith in Jesus Christ.
小结：现在，我们需要认识到，神话语的力量是活泼且有大能的。这一点极其重要。与看小说，或读一部有趣的人物传记不同的是，当我们读圣经时，圣灵在我们心里工作，建立我们在耶稣基督里的信心，并帮助我们一直保持这样的信心。

And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? (17) Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
罗10：14，17  然而人未曾信他，怎能求他呢？未曾听见他，怎能信他呢？没有传道的，怎能听见呢？17 可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。

Summary: When we say that the power of the Word effects faith in
Jesus Christ, we are not saying that everyone who hears the Word automatically comes to faith in Jesus. We are merely sighting the fact that God’s Word is God’s tool to effect faith in his Son. Certainly God could work without means or tools as some suppose that God calls or converts people directly. However, God has not told us about that in his Word. He has, however, told us that through the message of the gospel he effects faith in Jesus. When that faith is created, it’s always 100% the grace of God working through his all-powerful Word. When unbelief results, it is always the fault of man.
小结：当我们谈到神话语的能力使我们产生对基督的信心时，并不是说，任何人只要一听到神的话语，就会自动地相信耶稣。我们只是在点明一个事实：神的话是神使用的工具，在人心里产生对他儿子的信心。有人认为，神也可以不需任何途径或工具而直接呼召人，叫人悔改。神当然也能这么做，只是在他的话语中没有告诉我们有关这方面的事情。但他确实告诉我们，他借助福音的信息，使我们产生对基督的信心。信心的产生完全是100%神的恩典，透过他全能的话语在做工。而不信的结果却完全是人自己的错误。
Ephesians 2:8-9 8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9not by works, so that no one can boast.10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
弗2：8-10
8. 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的。
9. 也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。
10. 我们原是祂的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们 行的。
Matthew 23:37 37"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
太23：37 “耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊！你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。
1 Timothy 2:3,4 3This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
提前2：3-4
3：这是好的、在　神我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。
4：他愿意万人得救、明白真道．
Summary: Consider how these three Bible teachings do not coincide with our way of thinking or our reason:
小结：思考以下三处经文，看看它们怎样与我们的想法或理性不一致。
1.God desires the salvation of all mankind (1 Timothy 2:3,4)
1.神期望整个人类都能够得到救赎。（提前2：3，4）
2.God puts his love on display for the whole world, yet many reject him in unbelief. (Matthew 23:37)
2. 神向全世界的人展示了他的爱，然而很多人不信、拒绝他。（太23：37）
3.God’s chosen children who come to faith, did not come to faith by their own thinking or choosing, but only because of the power of God’s Almighty Word, which shattered the pride of their unbelief and caused a conversion. (Ephesians 2:8,9)
3. 蒙拣选而成为神的儿女的人，他们的信不是凭借自己的意志或选择，而是神话语的大能使然。这种能力粉碎了不信的傲气，造就了得救的信心。（弗2：8，9）
This leaves us with an interesting dilemma. If we had nothing to do with our conversion and the Bible clearly teaches us that we didn’t have anything to do with our conversion, and yet God desires the salvation of all, and yet not everyone comes to faith in Jesus… What shall we do with this dilemma?
这一事实使我们陷入一种有趣的困境。如果我们与自己的得救毫无关系 ，圣经也清楚地教导，我们与自己的得救没有关系，但神的期望却是让所有的人都能得救。可实际上，并不是每个人都信耶稣，那么，我们该怎么处理这种困境呢？
As Martin Luther came across these sorts of paradoxes or inconsistencies in the Scripture, he used to teach his people to lay aside their reason lest we pollute the clear teachings of the Word of God. Luther said, “It is not Christianity that needs to be made reasonable. It is our reason that needs to be made Christian.” Faith must always look beyond what can be physically seen or proven by our senses.
当马丁路德遇到圣经中的这类矛盾或冲突时，他往往告诉他的会众放下他们的理性，以免污染神话语的教导。路德说：“并不是基督信仰需要符合理性，而是我们的理性需要符合基督信仰。”信心总是必须能看到超越我们的感官所能看见、证实的限度。
The Bible also teaches us that God is at work in his Word both when it is received in faith for the conversion of the sinner, and God’s Spirit is at work in the hardening of a person’s heart. That’s not the same as saying that God desires man to harden his heart. It just means that God is at work by his Spirit even when man chooses to reject God and his plan of salvation for him.
圣经也教导我们，神在他的话语里做工，使罪人转变、相信基督；神的灵也会做工，使人的心变得刚硬。然而，却不可以说，神期望人的心变得刚硬。它的意思只是说，即使当人选择拒绝神，以及他为人预备的拯救计划时，神仍然在借着他的灵做工。

太7:6 不 要把圣 物 给 狗 ， 也 不 要 把 你 们 的 珍 珠 丢 在 猪 前 ， 恐 怕它 践 踏 了 珍 珠 ， 转 过 来 咬 你 们。
Summary: Clearly the Scripture teaches that while a man can do nothing to earn his salvation, he does have the power to resist the Holy Spirit. In fact, that’s exactly what the state of unbelief is – a continual resisting of the God the Holy Spirit to lead our souls to repent of sin and to turn to Jesus for salvation.
小结：圣经清楚地教导，尽管一个人在得到救恩方面无能为力，但他却能拒绝圣灵。实际上，那正是不信的真实写照---持续不断地抗拒神的圣灵，而他要引导我们的心认罪悔改，转向耶稣得救恩。
Since it is the Word that effects faith and it is the Word that hardens a sinner’s heart with persistent unbelief, it is important that we carry the Word of salvation to the ends of the earth for this very reason.
是神的话使我们产生信心，也是神的话使罪人的心刚硬而持续不信。正因为如此，我们必须把救赎的话语带到地极，这是至关重要的！

3.Why would we need the Holy Spirit’s help to confess Jesus as our Lord and Savior?
3. 我们为什么需要圣灵的帮助，才能承认耶稣是我们的主和救赎主？

Romans 10:13-17 Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news.” But not all the Israelites accep ted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
罗10：13-17  因为“凡求告主名的，就必得救。”然而人未曾信他，怎能求他呢？未曾听见他，怎能信他呢？没有传道的，怎能听 见呢？若没有奉差遣，怎能传道呢？如经上所记：“报福音传喜信的人，他们的脚踪何 等佳美！”只是人没有都听从福音。因为以赛亚说：“主啊，我们所传的有谁信呢？” 可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。

According to the words of St. Paul, who will be saved, everyone who does what? --------------------
根据使徒保罗的话，那些将得救的人是谁，是每一个做什么的人？------------------------.
Summary: The truth that God has worked faith in my heart is called “conversion,” which means “being turned around.” Think of how God turned Saul/the apostle Paul around on the road to Damascus.
小结：神已经在我心里做工而使我相信，这个真理叫作“转变”，意为“回转过来”。想想神是怎样使扫罗/ 使徒保罗在往大马色的路上回转过来的。
Read Acts 9:1-9
1Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest 2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. 3As he neared Damascus on his journey,
suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" 5"Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied. 6"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do." 7The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. 8Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. 9For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.　　
读使徒行传9：1-9
9:1 扫罗仍然向主的门徒，口吐威吓凶杀的话，去见大祭司，
9:2 求文书给大马士革的各会堂，若是找着信奉这道的人，无论男女，都准他捆绑带到耶路撒冷。
9:3 扫罗行路，将到大马士革，忽然从天上发光，四面照着他。
9:4 他就仆倒在地，听见有声音对他说，扫罗，扫罗，你为什么逼迫我。
9:5 他说，主阿，你是谁。主说，我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。
9:6 起来，进城去，你当作的事，必有人告诉你。
9:7 同行的人，站在那里，说不出话来，听见声音，却看不见人。
9:8 扫罗从地上起来，睁开眼睛，竟不能看见什么。有人拉他的手，领他进了大马士革。
9:9 三日不能看见，也不吃，也不喝。
Summary: Our conversions to the faith may not have been nearly as spectacular as Saul’s conversion to Christianity. However, it is the same powerful Word of the Gospel that caused our conversion as it was with the Apostle Paul when he had the Word made flesh call out to him on the road to Damascus.
小结：我们回转相信神的经历，可能根本不如扫罗归向基督信仰的经历那么精彩。然而，导致我们回转的福音话语的能力，却与扫罗在大马色路上被道成肉身的神呼唤时的能力是一样的巨大。
God Desires the salvation of all Mankind
神期望整个人类都得到救赎。
II Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
彼后3：9主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。
Because God seeks the repentance of all, where does he want us Christians to go and preach his Word?
因为神期望所有的人都悔改，那么他要我们基督徒到哪里去传扬他的话？
Ezekiel 18:23,32“Do I take pleasure in the death of the wicked?” declares the Lord. “Rather am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone,” declares the Lord. “Repent and live!”
结18：23 主耶和华说：恶人死亡，岂是我喜悦的吗？不是喜悦他回头离开所行的道存活吗？
32 主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。”
Because it doesn’t please God to see anyone perish, where does God want us to go with the gospel?
因为神不喜悦看见任何一个人灭亡，那么，神要我们把福音带到哪里？
Two Reminders for God’s Children
给神儿女的两个提醒：
Hebrews 3:12 See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
来3：12 弟兄们，你们要谨慎，免得你们中间或有人存着不信的恶心，把永生神离弃了。
Warning 1:
警告 1：
Hebrews 10:26-29 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
来10：26-29
来10:26 因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了；
来10:27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火。
来10:28 人干犯摩西的律法，凭两三个见证人，尚且不得怜恤而死；
来10:29 何况人践踏　神的儿子，将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常，又亵慢施恩的圣灵；你们想，他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢！
Warning 2:
警告2：
I Peter 2:2“Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
彼前2：2就要爱慕那纯净的灵奶，像才生的婴孩爱慕奶一样，叫你们因此渐长，以致得救。你们若尝过主恩的滋味，就必如此。
Summary: Can you imagine a new mother giving her infant child sour milk or milk that has been expired for about 2 years from a bottle? That would be an unloving and uncaring mother. The baby craves the pure milk from his mother’s breast so that he might grow up and learn to eat solid food in the future. So it is, that Peter reminds Christians to “crave” or have an appetite for pure doctrine, not polluted doctrine. Listening to teachers that bring false information, be it ever so small makes about as much sense as feeding your infant child sour milk that has been expired for 2 years. Now that we have tasted the sweet message of God’s love in the gospel, let us not demand to hear nothing less than the sweet gospel of Jesus.
小结：你能想象一位初为人母的妇女，会把变酸了的牛奶，或者过期两年的牛奶给她的新生婴儿喝吗？那肯定是一个没有爱和关怀的母亲。婴儿渴慕母亲的纯奶，使她能够长大，然后慢慢学习吃固体的食物。照样，彼得也提醒基督徒“渴慕”纯洁的教导，而不是被污染的教导。听人讲错误的信息，不管是多么微小的错误，都像是一个母亲在给自己的婴儿喂放酸了的、或者过期两年的牛奶。我们既然已经尝到福音中神爱的甘甜，让我们只祈求听见耶稣的甘美福音。

4. Why are some saved while others remain lost? (II Peter 3:9; Matthew 23:37)
4. 为什么有人得救，而另一些人失丧？（彼后3：9； 太23：37）
5. Do I have to “feel saved” to be saved? (I John 3:20; Romans 7:15ff; Galatians 5:22-23; Romans15:13)
5. 我必须“感觉得救”，才真地得救吗？（约一3：20；罗7：15；加5:22-23; 罗15:13）
