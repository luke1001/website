4.Suggested daily bible reading: Romans 1-7.
建议每日经文阅读：罗马书1-7
After parting the Red Sea, God led the Israelites to the borders of the land of Israel. Moses then sent 12 men (one from each of the 12 tribes descended from Jacob’s 12 sons) into the land to “check it out”. They reported that the land was great, but the people in it were strong. In fact, 10 out of the 12 spies said that they couldn’t take the land. Only two spies (Joshua and Caleb) attempted to convince the people to trust God. “And do not be afraid of the people of the land. … the Lord is with us. Do not be afraid of them.” (Num. 14:9)
Unfortunately the people listened to the 10 untrusting spies. As a result, God declared that the Israelites would have to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until this untrusting generation had died. (God made Joshua and Caleb, the two faithful spies, exceptions.)
After the 40 years, God brought them again to the land. Moses, the leader, died just as they reached the border. In Moses’ place, God appoints Joshua as the new leader. Today we see how God began to give them to the land of Israel, just as he had promised to Abraham.
离开红海后，神带领以色列民到以色列边境。摩西当时派遣12个人（从雅各的12个儿子传下来的12个部落中各选一个人）去检查这块土地。他们报告说土地很棒，但生活在那的人很强壮。事实上，12个探子中的10个说他们不可能取得那地。只有两个探子（约书亚和迦勒）试图使大家相信神，“不要怕那地的居民…有耶和华和我们同在。不要怕他们。（民数记14：9）
不幸的是他们相信听了那10个不应信赖的探子的话。结果，神宣布以色列民要在旷野游荡40年直到这个不信的一代人死去。（神使忠实的探子约书亚和迦勒除外。）
40年后，神又把他们带回那块土地。当他们到达边界时，领袖摩西死了。神指派约书亚作新的领导代替摩西。今天我们看到神如何开始把以色列的领土给他们，正如他向亚伯拉罕应许的那样。

彼得前书3：21
Martin Luther was pastor in Germany in the early and middle 1500’s. Luther recognized the great difficulty which many people have in teaching the truths of the Bible to their children. In order to help them, Luther wrote the Catechism. (The Catechism presented the truths of the Bible in a simple, orderly way, making it easier for a parent to teach their children the importance of Scripture.) Below are the Biblical truths regarding baptism as Luther organized them, in a way that parents could teach them to their children.
马丁路德是在15世纪早期和中期在德国当牧师。路德认识到很多人对于教导他们的孩子圣经的真理时有很大困难。为了帮助他们，路德写了问答集。（问答集用简单，有序的方法介绍圣经的真理，使家长更容易教导孩子圣经的重要性。）以下是路德整理的，父母能用以教授孩子有关洗礼的符合圣经的真理。

The Sacrament of Holy Baptism
神圣的洗礼仪式

As the head of the family should teach it in the simplest way to those of his household.
作为家庭之首他应该用最简单的方法教授家庭成员。


THE INSTITUTION OF BAPTISM
             洗礼的制定

First:  What is Baptism?
首先：洗礼是什么？

Baptism is not just plain water, but it is water used by God’s command and connected with God’s Word.
洗礼不只是用普通的水，而是因着神的诫命并与神的话联系在一起的水。

Which is that Word of God?
哪段神的话

Christ our Lord says in the last chapter of Mathew, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit!”
我们的主基督在马太福音最后一章说：“你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父，子，圣灵的名给他们施洗。”

THE BLESSINGS OF BAPTISM
               洗礼的赐福

Second: What does Baptism do for us?
     第二： 洗礼为我们作了什么？

Baptism works forgiveness of sin, delivers from death and the devil and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.
洗礼使神对罪的宽恕在我们身上做工，使我们脱离死亡和魔鬼，并给所有相信的人永远的救赎，正如神的话语和应许一样。

What is God’s promise?
神的应许是什么？

Christ our Lord says in the last chapter of Mark, “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.”
我们的主基督在马可福音最后一章说：“ 信而受洗的必然得救，不信的必被定     罪。”  

THE POWER OF BAPTISM
             洗礼的大能    

Third: How can water do such great things?
 第三：水怎能做如此伟大的事？
It is certainly not the water that does such things, but God’s Word which is in and with the water, and faith which trusts this Word used with the water. For without God’s Word the water is just plain water and not Baptism. But with this Word it is Baptism. God’s Word makes it a washing through which God graciously forgives our sin and grants us rebirth and a new life through the Holy Spirit.
肯定不是水做如此伟大的事，而是与水同在的神的话语，和相信与水同时使用的神的话语的信心。因为没有神的话，水只是普通的水，无关乎洗礼。但因着神的话水才是用于洗礼的圣洁之水。神的话使水成为对我们的罪的洗涤，通过罪的洗礼神仁慈地宽恕我们的罪，授予我们新生，一个因着圣灵而来的新的生命，
Where is this written?
这些写在哪里？

St. Paul says in Titus, chapter 3, “God saved us through the washing of rebirth and  renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become  heirs having the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying.”
圣保罗在提多书三章说“神救了我们籍着重生地洗和圣灵的新生，圣灵就是籍着耶稣基督，我们救主重重浇灌在我们身上的，好叫我们因他的恩得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣。

THE MEANING OF BAPTISM FOR OUR DAILY LIFE
 洗礼对于我们的日常生活的意义

Fourth: What does baptizing with water mean?
  第四：   用水洗礼意味着什么？

It means that our Old Adam with his evil deeds and desires should be drowned by daily contrition and repentance, and die, and that day by day a new man should arise,as from the dead, to live in the presence of God in righteousness and purity now and forever.
它意味着我们带着恶行和欲望的罪恶本性应该被每日的忏悔和悔悟淹没，罪性死掉。日继一日，一个像从死里复活的新人，在神面前，在正义和纯洁里生活，从现在直到永远。

Where is this written?
这些写在哪里？

St. Paul says in Romans, chapter 6, “We were buried with Christ through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.”
圣保罗在罗马书6章说，“我们籍着洗礼归于死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督籍着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。
