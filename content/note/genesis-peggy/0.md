Introduction to the book of Genesis创世纪序言
Introduction to the book of Genesis
创世纪序言
The Book of Genesis (beginning) is the first of five books known collectively as the Pentateuch. Moses, the author of the Book of Genesis was born in Egypt, raised by his mother and the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter. Moses probably wrote the Book of Genesis some time during the forty years that the Israelites wandered in the desert.
创世纪（起初）是摩西五经里的第一本书。摩西，创世纪的作者，出生在埃及，由他的母亲养大，他也是法老女儿的养子。摩西可能是在以色列在旷野流浪的四十年里写的创世纪。
The book of Genesis is foundational to the understanding of the rest of the Bible. It is a book of relationships, highlighting those between God and nature, God and man, and man and man. It clearly teaches that the one true God is sovereign over all that exists.
创世纪是理解整本圣经的基础。正本书包含了许多关系， 突出了神与自然，神与人，以及人与人之间的关系。它清楚地教导了这位独一真神的主权高于一切。
