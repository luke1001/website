Genesis 49 Jacob Blesses His Sons
创世纪49 雅各给众子祝福

Jacob Blesses His Sons雅各给众子祝福
            (1) Then Jacob called for his sons and said: "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
            (2) "Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.
            (3) "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength,     excelling in honor, excelling in power. (4) Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it.  What does Jacob say to Reuben
            49:1雅各叫了他的儿子们来，说，你们都来聚集，我好把你们日后必遇的事告诉你们。
49:2雅各的儿子们，你们要聚集而听，要听你们父亲以色列的话。
49:3流便哪，你是我的长子，是我力量强壮的时候生的，本当大有尊荣，权力超众。49:4但你放纵情欲，滚沸如水，必不得居首位。因为你上了你父亲的床，污秽了我的榻。雅各对流便说了什么？
(5) "Simeon and Levi are brothers— their swords are weapons of violence. (6) Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased. (7) Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel. What does Jacob say to Simeon and Levi
            49:5西缅和利未是弟兄。他们的刀剑是残忍的器具。49:6我的灵阿，不要与他们同谋。我的心哪，不要与他们联络。因为他们趁怒杀害人命，任意砍断牛腿大筋。49:7他们的怒气暴烈可咒。他们的忿恨残忍可诅。我要使他们分居在雅各家里，散住在以色列地中。雅各对西缅和利未说了什么？
(8) "Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you. (9) You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down,  like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? (10) The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his. (11) He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes. (12) His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk. What does Jacob say to Judah?
49:8犹大阿，你弟兄们必赞美你。你手必掐住仇敌的颈项。你父亲的儿子们必向你下拜。49:9犹大是个小狮子。我儿阿，你抓了食便上去。你屈下身去，卧如公狮，蹲如母狮，谁敢惹你。49:10圭必不离犹大，杖必不离他两脚之间，直等细罗（就是赐平安者）来到，万民都必归顺。49:11犹大把小驴拴在葡萄树上，把驴驹拴在美好的葡萄树上。他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。49:12他的眼睛必因酒红润。他的牙齿必因奶白亮。雅各对犹大说了什么？
            (13) "Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon. What does Jacob say to Zebulun?
            (14) "Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down between two saddlebags. (15) When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor. What does Jacob say to Issachar?
49:13西布伦必住在海口，必成为停船的海口。他的境界必延到西顿。雅各对西布伦说了什么？
49:14以萨迦是个强壮的驴，卧在羊圈之中。49:15他以安静为佳，以肥地为美，便低肩背重，成为服苦的仆人。雅各对以萨迦说了什么？
            (16) "Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel. (17) Dan will be a serpent by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward. What does Jacob say to Dan?
49:16但必判断他的民，作以色列支派之一。49:17但必作道上的蛇，路中的虺，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的坠落于后。雅各对但说了什么？
            (18) "I look for your deliverance, O LORD.
            (19) "Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels. What does Jacob say to Gad?
            (20) "Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king. What does Jacob say toAsher?
            (21) "Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns. What does Jacob say to Naphtali
49:18耶和华阿，我向来等候你的救恩。
49:19迦得必被敌军追逼，他却要追逼他们的脚跟。雅各对迦得说了什么？
49:20亚设之地必出肥美的粮食，且出君王的美味。雅各对亚设说了什么？
49:21拿弗他利是被释放的母鹿。他出嘉美的言语。雅各对拿弗他利说了什么？
            (22) "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring,  whose branches climb over a wall. Here we learn about Ephraim and Manasseh. (23) With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility. (24) But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, (25) because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb. (26) Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
49:22约瑟是多结果子的树枝，是泉旁多结果的枝子。他的枝条探出墙外。从这里我们知道以法莲和玛拿西的未来。49:23弓箭手将他苦害，向他射箭，逼迫他。49:24但他的弓仍旧坚硬。他的手健壮敏捷。这是因以色列的牧者，以色列的磐石就是雅各的大能者。49:25你父亲的神必帮助你。那全能者必将天上所有的福，地里所藏的福，以及生产乳养的福，都赐给你。49:26你父亲所祝的福，胜过我祖先所祝的福，如永世的山岭，至极的边界。这些福必降在约瑟的头上，临列那与弟兄迥别之人的顶上。
            (27) "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder." What does Jacob say to Benjamin?
            (28) All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
49:27便雅悯是个撕掠的狼，早晨要吃他所抓的，晚上要分他所夺的。雅各对便雅悯说了什么？
49:28这一切是以色列的十二支派。这也是他们的父亲对他们所说的话，为他们所祝的福，都是按着各人的福分为他们祝福。

The Death of Jacob 雅各之死
            (29) Then he gave them these instructions: "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite, (30) the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field. (31) There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah. (32) The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites." In what ways did Jacob express his faith as he gave instructions for his burial?
49:29他又嘱咐他们说，我将要归到我列祖（原文作本民）那里，你们要将我葬在赫人以弗仑田间的洞里，与我祖我父在一处，49:30就是在迦南地幔利前，麦比拉田间的洞。那洞和田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业，作坟地的。49:31他们在那里葬了亚伯拉罕和他妻子撒拉，又在那里葬了以撒和他妻子利百加。我也在那里葬了利亚。49:32那块田和田间的洞原是向赫人买的。在雅各对众子嘱咐后事时，他如何表达了他的信心？
(33) When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people. How do we know Jacob died as a believer?
49:33雅各嘱咐众子已毕，就把脚收在床上，气绝而死，归到列祖（原文作本民）那里去了。我们如何知道雅各离世时是一个信徒？

Genesis 50 Jacob Is Buried
创世纪50 埋葬雅各

            (1)Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him. (2) Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, (3) taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. What special honors and activities marked the death and burial of Jacob?
50:1约瑟伏在他父亲的面上哀哭，与他亲嘴。50:2约瑟吩咐伺候他的医生用香料薰他父亲，医生就用香料薰了以色列。50:3薰尸的常例是四十天。那四十天满了，埃及人为他哀哭了七十天。有什么特别殊荣和活动标记了雅各的离世和埋葬？
            (4) When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's court, "If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, (5) 'My father made me swear an oath and said, "I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.' " What request does Joseph make of Pharaoh?
50:4为他哀哭的日子过了，约瑟对法老家中的人说，我若在你们眼前蒙恩，请你们报告法老说，50:5我父亲要死的时候叫我起誓说，你要将我葬在迦南地，在我为自己所掘的坟墓里。现在求你让我上去葬我父亲，以后我必回来。约瑟对法老作出了什么请求？
            (6) Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do."  (7) So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh's officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt- (8) besides all the members of Joseph's household and his brothers and those belonging to his father's household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. (9) Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company. Why would chariots and horsemen join in the procession?
50:6法老说，你可以上去，照着你父亲叫你起的誓，将他葬埋。50:7于是约瑟上去葬他父亲。与他一同上去的，有法老的臣仆和法老家中的长老，并埃及国的长老，50:8还有约瑟的全家和他的弟兄们，并他父亲的眷属。只有他们的妇人孩子，和羊群牛群，都留在歌珊地。50:9又有车辆马兵，和他一同上去。那一帮人甚多。为什么车辆马兵也一同上去了？
            (10) When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. How many additional days did Joseph mourn? (11) When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning." That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
50:10他们到了约但河外，亚达的禾场，就在那里大大地号啕痛哭。约瑟为他父亲哀哭了七天。约瑟又为他父亲哀哭了几天？50:11迦南的居民见亚达禾场上的哀哭，就说，这是埃及人一场大的哀哭。因此那地方名叫亚伯麦西，是在约但河东。
            (12) So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them: (13) They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field. (14) After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. In what ways did Jacob's sons express their faith both during and after their father's burial?
50:12雅各的儿子们就遵着他父亲所吩咐的办了，50:13把他搬到迦南地，葬在幔利前，麦比拉田间的洞里。那洞和田是亚伯拉罕向赫人以弗仑买来为业，作坟地的。50:14约瑟葬了他父亲以后，就和众弟兄，并一切同他上去葬他父亲的人，都回埃及去了。在他们父亲的葬礼过程中以及之后，雅各的儿子们如何表达了他们的信心的？

Joseph Reassures His Brothers 约瑟向众弟兄保证
            (15) When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?" Why do you think the brothers feared Joseph might take revenge against them? (16) So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father left these instructions before he died: (17) 'This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.' Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father." When their message came to him, Joseph wept. What do you think is the reason for Joseph tears?
50:15约瑟的哥哥们见父亲死了，就说，或者约瑟怀恨我们，照着我们从前待他一切的恶足足地报复我们。你认为哥哥们为什么会害怕约瑟向他们报仇？50:16他们就打发人去见约瑟，说，你父亲未死以先吩咐说，50:17你们要对约瑟这样说，从前你哥哥们恶待你，求你饶恕他们的过犯和罪恶。如今求你饶恕你父亲神之仆人的过犯。他们对约瑟说这话，约瑟就哭了。你认为约瑟为什么哭了？
            (18) His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. "We are your slaves," they said. (19) But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God? (20) You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. (21) So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children." And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. What did Joseph remind his brothers?
50:18他的哥哥们又来俯伏在他面前，说，我们是你的仆人。50:19约瑟对他们说，不要害怕，我岂能代替神呢？50:20从前你们的意思是要害我，但神的意思原是好的，要保全许多人的性命，成就今日的光景。50:21现在你们不要害怕，我必养活你们和你们的妇人孩子。于是约瑟用亲爱的话安慰他们。约瑟再一次提醒哥哥们什么？

The Death of Joseph 约瑟之死
            (22) Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years (23) and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph's knees. What later-in-life blessings did God allow Joseph to enjoy?
50:22约瑟和他父亲的眷属都住在埃及。约瑟活了一百一十岁。50:23约瑟得见以法莲第三代的子孙。玛拿西的孙子，玛吉的儿子也养在约瑟的膝上。神让约瑟享受到了什么晚年的祝福？
            (24) Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob." (25) And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place."  What great confidence did Joseph express to his brothers as he was about to die?
50:24约瑟对他弟兄们说，我要死了，但神必定看顾你们，领你们从这地上去，到他起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各之地。50:25约瑟叫以色列的子孙起誓说，神必定看顾你们。你们要把我的骸骨从这里搬上去。约瑟临死前他对他的哥哥们表达了什么样的伟大信心？
            (26) So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
50:26约瑟死了，正一百一十岁。人用香料将他薰了，把他收殓在棺材里，停在埃及。

            What confidence can we take from the contents of Genesis as we live out the rest of our lives? At the time of our death?
从创世纪的内容中我们可以汲取到什么样的信心来伴我们度过以后的生命？甚至是在我们离世时？

Notes注释
Speak to Pharaoh - Joseph days of mourning had not yet ended.
报告法老---约瑟哀哭的日子还没有结束。
