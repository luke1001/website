Genesis 20 Abraham and Abimelech 创世纪20 亚伯拉罕与亚比米勒

Genesis 20 Abraham and Abimelech
创世纪20 亚伯拉罕与亚比米勒
(1) Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. After living twenty years near Mamre, what move did Abraham make? For a while he stayed in Gerar, (2) and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. What spiritual weakness did Abraham exhibit a second time?
20:1亚 伯 拉 罕 从 那 里 向 南 地 迁 去 ， 寄 居 在 加 低 斯 和 书 珥 中 间 的 基 拉 耳 。在幔利居住了20年后，亚伯拉罕迁到哪里去了？20:2亚 伯 拉 罕 称 他 的 妻 撒 拉 为 妹 子 ， 基 拉 耳 王 亚 比 米 勒 差 人 把 撒 拉 取 了 去 亚伯拉罕又再次表现出了什么样的属灵的软弱？
(3) But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman." What did God reveal to Abimelech?
20:3但 夜 间 神 来 在 梦 中 对 亚 比 米 勒 说 ， 你 是 个 死 人 哪 ， 因 为 你 取 了 那 女 人 来 。 她 原 是 别 人 的 妻 子 。神将什么启示给了亚比米勒？
(4) Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? (5) Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands." Why did Abimelech say he had a “clear conscience”?
20:4亚 比 米 勒 却 还 没 有 亲 近 撒 拉 。 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 连 有 义 的 国 ， 你 也 要 毁 灭 吗 ？20:5那 人 岂 不 是 自 己 对 我 说 ， 她 是 我 的 妹 子 吗 ？ 就 是 女 人 也 自 己 说 ， 他 是 我 的 哥 哥 。 我 作 这 事 是 心 正 手 洁 的 。亚比米勒为什么说自己是心正手洁？
(6) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. (7) Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. How could Abimelech make it right? But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will die." What would happen if Abimelech did not make it right?
20:6神 在 梦 中 对 他 说 ， 我 知 道 你 作 这 事 是 心 中 正 直 。 我 也 拦 阻 了 你 ， 免 得 你 得 罪 我 ， 所 以 我 不 容 你 沾 着 她 。20:7现 在 你 把 这 人 的 妻 子 归 还 他 。 因 为 他 是 先 知 ， 他 要 为 你 祷 告 ， 使 你 存 活 。 亚比米勒要怎样做才是对的？你 若 不 归 还 他 ， 你 当 知 道 ， 你 和 你 所 有 的 人 都 必 要 死 。如果亚比米勒不这样做的话，会有什么事情发生？
(8) Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid. (9) Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done." (10) And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?" What just complaint did Abimelech present to Abraham regarding Abraham’s conduct?
20:8亚 比 米 勒 清 早 起 来 ， 召 了 众 臣 仆 来 ， 将 这 些 事 都 说 给 他 们 听 ， 他 们 都 甚 惧 怕 。20:9亚 比 米 勒 召 了 亚 伯 拉 罕 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 怎 么 向 我 这 样 行 呢 ？ 我 在 什 么 事 上 得 罪 了 你 ， 你 竟 使 我 和 我 国 里 的 人 陷 在 大 罪 里 。 你 向 我 行 不 当 行 的 事 了 。20:10亚 比 米 勒 又 对 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 你 见 了 什 么 才 作 这 事 呢 ？亚比米勒怎样向亚伯拉罕抱怨他的行为的？
(11) Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' (12) Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. (13) And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother." What do you think of Abraham’s explanation/defense of his action?
20:11亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 我 以 为 这 地 方 的 人 总 不 惧 怕 神 ， 必 为 我 妻 子 的 缘 故 杀 我 。20:12况 且 她 也 实 在 是 我 的 妹 子 。 她 与 我 是 同 父 异 母 ， 后 来 作 了 我 的 妻 子 。20:13当 神 叫 我 离 开 父 家 ， 飘 流 在 外 的 时 候 ， 我 对 她 说 ， 我 们 无 论 走 到 什 么 地 方 ， 你 可 以 对 人 说 ， 他 是 我 的 哥 哥 。 这 就 是 你 待 我 的 恩 典 了 。你是怎样看待亚伯拉罕为自己的行为而做出的辩解？
(14) Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him. (15) And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like." What surprising generosity did Abimelech show to Abraham and Sarah?
20:14亚 比 米 勒 把 牛 ， 羊 ， 仆 婢 赐 给 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 又 把 他 的 妻 子 撒 拉 归 还 他 。20:15亚 比 米 勒 又 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 的 地 都 在 你 面 前 ， 你 可 以 随 意 居 住 。亚比米勒怎样做表现出他对亚伯拉罕和撒拉惊人的宽宏大量？
(16) To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated." (17) Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again, (18) for the LORD had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah. For what did Abraham pray?
20:16又 对 撒 拉 说 ， 我 给 你 哥 哥 一 千 银 子 ， 作 为 你 在 合 家 人 面 前 遮 羞 的 （ 羞 原 文 作 眼 ） ， 你 就 在 众 人 面 前 没 有 不 是 了 。20:17亚 伯 拉 罕 祷 告 神 ， 神 就 医 好 了 亚 比 米 勒 和 他 的 妻 子 ， 并 他 的 众 女 仆 ， 她 们 便 能 生 育 。20:18因 耶 和 华 为 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 妻 子 撒 拉 的 缘 故 ， 已 经 使 亚 比 米 勒 家 中 的 妇 人 不 能 生 育 。亚伯拉罕为什么事祷告？

When is withholding information from someone who wants to know:
a) A virtue?
b) A vice?
什么时候对想要知道真相的人隐瞒是：
a) 道德的行为？
b) 不道德的行为？

NOTES注释
Dream – Once again God intervened to spare Sarah. Dreams were a frequent mode of revelation.
梦-上帝再次介入而使撒拉免于受害。梦常被用来启示上帝的旨意。
Prophet – Abraham was the first man to bear this title. God has revealed His purposes through him.
先知-亚伯拉罕是第一个得此称号的人。上帝透过他来启示自己的旨意。
Fear of God – “Fear” in this phrase has the sense of reverential trust in God.
敬畏神-“敬畏”在此处有虔敬的信靠神的含义。

She really is my sister – Abraham’s half-truth was a sinful deception, not a legitimate explanation.
她也实在是我的妹子-亚伯拉罕半真半假的解释是有意的欺骗，并非正当的辩解。


Genesis 21 Birth of Isaac
创世纪21章 以撒出生
(1) Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised. (2) Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. (3) Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. How did God keep His promise of a male heir to Abraham and Sarah? (4) When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. (5) Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. How old was Abraham when Isaac was born? (6) Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me." (7) And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."

(1) 耶和华按着先前的话眷顾撒拉，便照他所说的给撒拉成就。(2) 当亚伯拉罕年老的时候，撒拉怀了孕。到神所说的日期，就给亚伯拉罕生了一个儿子。 (3) 亚伯拉罕给撒拉所生的儿子起名叫以撒。上帝是怎样的持守祂向亚伯拉罕和撒拉所许的诺言的？ (4) 以撒生下来第八日，亚伯拉罕照着神所吩咐的，给以撒行了割礼。 (5) 他儿子以撒生的时候，亚伯拉罕年一百岁。当以撒出生的时候亚伯拉罕的年龄是？ (6) 撒拉说，神使我喜笑，凡听见的必与我一同喜笑。 (7) 又说，谁能预先对亚伯拉罕说撒拉要乳养婴孩呢？因为在他年老的时候，我给他生了一个儿子。

Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away
(8) The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. (9) But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, (10) and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac." What spoiled the celebration to mark the weaning of Isaac? Why did Sarah determine that it was necessary for Ishmael to be sent away?
(11) The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. (12) But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. (13) I will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is your offspring." How did God address and overcome Abraham’s reluctance to send Ishmael and Hagar away?
(14) Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. How did Abraham respond to God’s command to dismiss Ishmael?
(15) When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. (16) Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob. Of what was Hagar afraid?
(17) God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. (18) Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation." (19) Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. How did God show mercy to Hagar and Ishmael?
(20) God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. (21) While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. What do we learn about Ishmael as he continued to grow?

夏甲和以实玛利被逐
8 孩子渐长，就断了奶。以撒断奶的日子，亚伯拉罕设摆丰盛的筵席。 9 当时，撒拉看见埃及人夏甲给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子戏笑， 10 就对亚伯拉罕说，你把这使女和她儿子赶出去，因为这使女的儿子不可与我的儿子以撒一同承受产业。是什么破坏了以撒断奶的庆典？为什么撒拉下定决心要赶出以实玛利？
11 亚伯拉罕因他儿子的缘故很忧愁。 12 神对亚伯拉罕说，你不必为这童子和你的使女忧愁。凡撒拉对你说的话，你都该听从。因为从以撒生的，才要称为你的后裔。 13 至于使女的儿子，我也必使他的后裔成立一国，因为他是你所生的。上帝说了什么？如何使亚伯拉罕不再犹豫而赶出夏甲和以实玛利的？
14 亚伯拉罕清早起来，拿饼和一皮袋水，给了夏甲，搭在她的肩上，又把孩子交给她打发她走。夏甲就走了，在别是巴的旷野走迷了路。亚伯拉罕是怎样回应上帝对他所说打发走以实玛利的命令的？
15 皮袋的水用尽了，夏甲就把孩子撇在小树底下， 16 自己走开约有一箭之远，相对而坐，说，我不忍见孩子死，就相对而坐，放声大哭。夏甲惧怕什么？
17 神听见童子的声音。神的使者从天上呼叫夏甲说，夏甲，你为何这样呢？不要害怕，神已经听见童子的声音了。 18 起来，把童子抱在怀中（怀原文作手），我必使他的后裔成为大国。 19 神使夏甲的眼睛明亮，她就看见一口水井，便去将皮袋盛满了水，给童子喝。上帝是怎样向夏甲和以实玛利显明祂的怜悯的？
20 神保佑童子，他就渐长，住在旷野，成了弓箭手。 21 他住在巴兰的旷野。他母亲从埃及地给他娶了一个妻子。我们从以实玛利成长的事上学到了什么？

The Treaty at Beersheba
(22) At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do. (23) Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you are living as an alien the same kindness I have shown to you." Why did Abimelech and Phicol want to establish a treaty with Abraham and his descendants?
(24) Abraham said, "I swear it." (25) Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized. (26) But Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today." What dispute did Abraham clear up with Abimelech as they entered into a formal treaty?
(27) So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty. How do we know Abimelech solved the dispute? (28) Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, (29) and Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"

别是巴之约
22 当那时候，亚比米勒同他军长非各对亚伯拉罕说，凡你所行的事都有神的保佑。 23 我愿你如今在这里指着神对我起誓，不要欺负我与我的儿子，并我的子孙。我怎样厚待了你，你也要照样厚待我与你所寄居这地的民。为什么亚比米勒和非各要与亚伯拉罕和他的后代立约？
24 亚伯拉罕说，我情愿起誓。 25 从前，亚比米勒的仆人霸占了一口水井，亚伯拉罕为这事指责亚比米勒。 26 亚比米勒说，谁作这事，我不知道，你也没有告诉我，今日我才听见了。亚伯拉罕在与亚比米勒立约前提出了什么争议？
27 亚伯拉罕把羊和牛给了亚比米勒，二人就彼此立约。 我们怎样知道亚比米勒解决了那纠纷？28 亚伯拉罕把七只母羊羔另放在一处。 29 亚比米勒问亚伯拉罕说，你把这七只母羊羔另放在一处，是什么意思呢？

(30) He replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well." (31) So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.
(32) After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. (33) Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. (34) And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time. How did Abraham show his gratitude to God after the treaty was ratified?
30 他说，你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔，作我挖这口井的证据。 31 所以他给那地方起名叫别是巴，因为他们二人在那里起了誓。
32 他们在别是巴立了约，亚比米勒就同他军长非各起身回非利士地去了。 33 亚伯拉罕在别是巴栽上一棵垂丝柳树，又在那里求告耶和华永生神的名。 34 亚伯拉罕在非利士人的地寄居了多日。当条约签订后，亚伯拉罕是怎样向上帝献上感谢的？
