Genesis 42 Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt 创世纪42章 约瑟的弟兄前往埃及
Genesis 42 Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt
创世纪42章约瑟的弟兄前往埃及
            The famine had become so severe in Canaan that Jacob knew what had to be done.
迦南地的饥荒日益严重，雅各因此不得不做出决定。
            (1) When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?" (2) He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die." Why was it so important that Jacob's sons go to Egypt?
            1雅各见埃及有粮，就对儿子们说，你们为什么彼此观望呢？2我听见埃及有粮，你们可以下去，从那里为我们籴些来，使我们可以存活，不至于死。为什么雅各的儿子们去埃及地如此重要？
            (3) Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. (4) But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him. Why did Benjamin stay? (5) So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also. Who else went to buy grain in Egypt?
            3于是，约瑟的十个哥哥都下埃及籴粮去了。4但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯，雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去，因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害。为什么便雅悯留了下来？5来籴粮的人中有以色列的儿子们，因为迦南地也有饥荒。还有谁也一同去埃及地籴粮了？
            (6) Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground. Look up Gen. 37:5-7. What just came true? (7) As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food." What kind of welcome did Joseph give his brothers? Why do you think Joseph chose to present himself to his brothers as a very suspicious stranger? How long has it been since Joseph and his brothers have seen each other?
            6当时治理埃及地的是约瑟。粜粮给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了，脸伏于地，向他下拜。参看创 37:5-7这里应验了什么？7约瑟看见他哥哥们，就认得他们，却装作生人，向他们说些严厉话，问他们说，你们从哪里来。他们说，我们从迦南地来籴粮。约瑟用怎样的方式接待他的兄弟们？你认为约瑟为什么要对他们装作生人？约瑟和他的兄弟们有多久没见面了？
            (8) Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. (9) Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected." Of what did Joseph accuse his brothers? (10) "No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food. (11) We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies." How did the brothers answer Joseph? (12) "No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected." (13) But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more." Why did Joseph continue to call them spies?
            8约瑟认得他哥哥们，他们却不认得他。9约瑟想起从前所作的那两个梦，就对他们说，你们是奸细，来窥探这地的虚实。约瑟以什么缘由指责他的兄弟们？10他们对他说，我主阿，不是的。仆人们是籴粮来的。11我们都是一个人的儿子，是诚实人。仆人们并不是奸细。他的兄弟们是怎样回答约瑟的？12约瑟说，不然，你们必是窥探这地的虚实来的。13他们说，仆人们本是弟兄十二人，是迦南地一个人的儿子，顶小的现今在我们的父亲那里，有一个没有了。为什么约瑟坚持称他们为奸细？
            (14) Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you: You are spies! (15) And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. (16) Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!" (17) And he put them all in custody for three days. What test did Joseph devise for his brothers so they could prove they were not spies?
            14约瑟说，我才说你们是奸细，这话实在不错。15我指着法老的性命起誓，若是你们的小兄弟不到这里来，你们就不得出这地方，从此就可以把你们证验出来了。
16须要打发你们中间一个人去，把你们的兄弟带来。至于你们，都要囚在这里，好证验你们的话真不真，若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细。17于是约瑟把他们都下在监里三天。约瑟设计了怎样的方法来让他的兄弟们可以证明他们不是奸细？
            (18) On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God: (19) If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households. (20) But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do. What changes did Joseph make from his original demands so the brothers could prove they were not spies?
            18到了第三天，约瑟对他们说，我是敬畏神的。你们照我的话行就可以存活。
19你们如果是诚实人，可以留你们中间的一个人囚在监里，但你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。20把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，如此，你们的话便有证据，你们也不至于死。他们就照样而行。约瑟对自己原计划让他兄弟们证明清白的命令做了怎样的变动？
            (21) They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come upon us." (22) Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood." (23) They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter. Why did the brothers think they were being punished?
            21他们彼此说，我们在兄弟身上实在有罪。他哀求我们的时候，我们见他心里的愁苦，却不肯听，所以这场苦难临到我们身上。22流便说，我岂不是对你们说过，不可伤害那孩子吗？只是你们不肯听，所以流他血的罪向我们追讨。23他们不知道约瑟听得出来，因为在他们中间用通事传话。为什么约瑟的兄弟们认为是被罪追讨？
            (24) He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. Why do you think Joseph wept as he listened to his brothers' conversation? He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes. (25) Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them, (26) they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left. What did Joseph return to his brothers?
            24约瑟转身退去，哭了一场，又回来对他们说话，就从他们中间挑出西缅来，在他们眼前把他捆绑。你认为为什么当约瑟听到他兄弟们的谈话时哭了呢？25约瑟吩咐人把粮食装满他们的器具，把各人的银子归还在各人的口袋里，又给他们路上用的食物，人就照他的话办了。26他们就把粮食驮在驴上，离开那里去了。约瑟把什么归还了他的兄弟们？
            (27) At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack. (28) "My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack."
Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?" Why were the brothers afraid?
            27到了住宿的地方，他们中间有一个人打开口袋，要拿料喂驴，才看见自己的银子仍在口袋里，28就对弟兄们说，我的银子归还了，看哪，仍在我口袋里。他们就提心吊胆，战战兢兢地彼此说，这是神向我们作什么呢？约瑟的兄弟们为什么战兢呢？
            (29) When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said, (30) "The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land. (31) But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies. (32) We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'
            29他们来到迦南地，他们的父亲雅各那里，将所遭遇的事都告诉他，说，30          
那地的主对我们说严厉的话，把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。31我们对他说，我们是诚实人，并不是奸细。32我们本是弟兄十二人，都是一个父亲的儿子，有一个没有了，顶小的如今同我们的父亲在迦南地。
            (33) "Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, 'This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go. (34) But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.' " What did the brothers leave out of their account?
            33那地的主对我们说，若要我知道你们是诚实人，可以留下你们中间的一个人在我这里，你们可以带着粮食回去，救你们家里的饥荒。34把你们的小兄弟带到我这里来，我便知道你们不是奸细，乃是诚实人。这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们，你们也可以在这地作买卖。他们的说明缘由的时候忽略了什么？
            (35) As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened. (36) Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!" How did Jacob react to the report? (37) Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back."
            35后来他们倒口袋，不料，各人的银包都在口袋里。他们和父亲看见银包就都害怕。36他们的父亲雅各对他们说，你们使我丧失我的儿子，约瑟没有了，西缅也没有了，你们又要将便雅悯带去。这些事都归到我身上了。雅各是怎样回应这个汇报的？37流便对他父亲说，我若不带他回来交给你，你可以杀我的两个儿子。只管把他交在我手里，我必带他回来交给你。
            (38) But Jacob said, "My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow." Why did Jacob refuse to send Benjamin to Egypt at this time?
        38雅各说，我的儿子不可与你们一同下去。他哥哥死了，只剩下他，他若在你们所行的路上遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍，悲悲惨惨地下阴间去了。为什么这次雅各拒绝让便雅悯与他们一同去埃及地？
