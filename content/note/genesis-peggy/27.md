Genesis 37 Joseph’s Dreams 创世纪37约瑟得梦

Genesis 37 Joseph’s Dreams
创世纪37约瑟得梦

(1) Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
(2) This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. Who was Joseph's mother? What kind of report did Joseph bring to his father Jacob (Israel)?
37:1雅各住在迦南地，就是他父亲寄居的地。
37:2雅各的记略如下。约瑟十七岁与他哥哥们一同牧羊。他是个童子，与他父亲的妾辟拉，悉帕的儿子们常在一处。约瑟将他哥哥们的恶行报给他们的父亲。约瑟的母亲是谁？约瑟将什么报给他父亲雅各（以色列）知道？
 (3) Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him. How had Jacob showed favoritism to Joseph? Who else might wear such a coat? (4) When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. What kind of relationship did Joseph's brothers have with Joseph?
37:3以色列原来爱约瑟过于爱他的众子，因为约瑟是他年老生的。他给约瑟作了一件彩衣。雅各是如何偏爱约瑟的？什么样的人会穿这样的衣服？37:4约瑟的哥哥们见父亲爱约瑟过于爱他们，就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话。约瑟的哥哥们与约瑟的关系如何？

(5) Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. (6) He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had: (7) We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it." Describe Joseph's first dream?
37:5约瑟作了一梦，告诉他哥哥们，他们就越发恨他。37:6约瑟对他们说，请听我所作的梦，37:7我们在田里捆禾稼，我的捆起来站着，你们的捆来围着我的捆下拜。请描述一下约瑟的第一个梦。

(8) His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. How did Joseph's brothers feel towards Joseph now? What does hate mean?
37:8他的哥哥们回答说，难道你真要作我们的王吗？难道你真要管辖我们吗？他们就因为他的梦和他的话越发恨他。如今约瑟的哥哥们是如何看约瑟的？恨意味着什么？

(9) Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me." Describe Joseph's second dream?
37:9后来他又作了一梦，也告诉他的哥哥们说，看哪，我又作了一梦，梦见太阳，月亮，与十一个星向我下拜。请描述约瑟的第二个梦。

(10) When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?" (11) His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. What does it mean to rebuke someone?
37:10约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲和他哥哥们，他父亲就责备他说，你作的这是什么梦。难道我和你母亲，你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗？37:11他哥哥们都嫉妒他，他父亲却把这话存在心里。什么是责备一个人？

Joseph Sold by His Brothers 约瑟被兄长们所卖
(12) Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem, (13) and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.
(14) So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." What assignment did Jacob give Joseph? Why do you think Jacob might have been concerned about the brothers in Shechem? [Genesis 34: 25 (25)Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.] Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem, (15) a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?" Find Shechem on the map of Canaan in Old Testament Times
37:12约瑟的哥哥们往示剑去放他们父亲的羊。37:13以色列对约瑟说，你哥哥们不是在示剑放羊吗？你来，我要打发你往他们那里去。约瑟说，我在这里。37:14以色列说，你去看看你哥哥们平安不平安，群羊平安不平安，就回来报信给我。雅各给了约瑟什么事情做？你认为雅各为什么会担心在示剑放羊的哥哥们？【创世纪34：25到第三天，众人正在疼痛的时候，雅各的两个儿子，就是底拿的哥哥西缅和利未，各拿刀剑，趁着众人想不到的时候来到城中，把一切男丁都杀了，】于是打发他出希伯仑谷，他就往示剑去了。37:15有人遇见他在田野走迷了路，就问他说，你找什么？在旧约时代迦南地的地图上找到示剑。

(16) He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"
37:16他说，我找我的哥哥们，求你告诉我，他们在何处放羊。
(17) "They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.' " So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. Find Dothan on the map. (18) But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
37:17那人说，他们已经走了，我听见他们说要往多坍去。约瑟就去追赶他哥哥们，遇见他们在多坍。在地图上找到多坍。37:18他们远远地看见他，趁他还没有走到跟前，大家就同谋要害死他，

(19) "Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other. (20) "Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."  What was the brother's plan for Joseph?
37:19彼此说，你看。那作梦的来了。37:20来吧。我们将他杀了，丢在一个坑里，就说有恶兽把他吃了。我们且看他的梦将来怎么样。哥哥们要怎样对约瑟？

(21) When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said. (22) "Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. What proposal did Reuben make to his brothers to change the plan to kill Joseph?
37:21 流便听见了，要救他脱离他们的手，说，我们不可害他的性命。37:22         又说，不可流他的血，可以把他丢在这野地的坑里，不可下手害他。流便的意思是要救他脱离他们的手，把他归还他的父亲。流便向他的兄弟们提出了什么建议来改变杀害约瑟的计划？

(23) So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the richly ornamented robe he was wearing- (24) and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
(25) As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Who were the Ishmaelites? Find the area of Gilead on the map? Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
37:23约瑟到了他哥哥们那里，他们就剥了他的外衣，就是他穿的那件彩衣，37:24把他丢在坑里。那坑是空的，里头没有水。37:25他们坐下吃饭，举目观看，见有一伙米甸的以实玛利人从基列来，以实玛利人是谁？在地图上找到基列地？用骆驼驮着香料，乳香，没药，要带下埃及去。

(26) Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? (27) Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed. What is the new plan for Joseph disappearing?
37:26犹大对众弟兄说，我们杀我们的兄弟，藏了他的血有什么益处呢？37:27我们不如将他卖给以实玛利人，不可下手害他。因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的骨肉。众弟兄就听从了他。让约瑟消失的新计划是什么呢？

(28) So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. Where is Joseph taken?
37:28有些米甸的商人从那里经过，哥哥们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来，讲定二十舍客勒银子，把约瑟卖给以实玛利人。他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了。约瑟被带到哪里去了？

(29) When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. (30) He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?" Did Reuben know what the brothers had done with Joseph?
37:29流便回到坑边，见约瑟不在坑里，就撕裂衣服，37:30          回到兄弟们那里，说，童子没有了。我往哪里去才好呢？流便知道弟兄们对约瑟做了什么吗？
 (31) Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. (32) They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe." What did the brothers tell Jacob?
37:31他们宰了一只公山羊，把约瑟的那件彩衣染了血，37:32     打发人送到他们的父亲那里，说，我们捡了这个。请认一认是你儿子的外衣不是，哥哥们告诉了雅各什么？

(33) He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces." What did Jacob believe had happened to Joseph?
37:33他认得，就说，这是我儿子的外衣。有恶兽把他吃了，约瑟被撕碎了。撕碎了。雅各认为约瑟发生了什么事？

(34) Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. (35) All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son." So his father wept for him. What did Jacob do after he saw the robe?
37:34雅各便撕裂衣服，腰间围上麻布，为他儿子悲哀了多日。37:35他的儿女都起来安慰他，他却不肯受安慰，说，我必悲哀着下阴间，到我儿子那里。约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭。雅各看到彩衣后他是怎么做的？
(36) Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
37:36米甸人带约瑟到埃及，把他卖给法老的内臣护卫长波提乏。
