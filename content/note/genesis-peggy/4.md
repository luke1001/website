Genesis 6 The Events Preceding the Flood 创世纪第六章 发生在大洪水之前的事
Genesis 6 The Events Preceding the Flood
创世纪第六章 发生在大洪水之前的事
The “sons of God”, the descendants of Seth, had for a long time kept themselves from the Cainites. But gradually they began to forget God and had relations with “the daughters of men”, the descendants of Cain. The account of the Flood shows us God’s holiness and justice, but also His long-suffering.
“神的儿子们”，即塞特的后裔，在很长的时期里都与该隐的后裔没有来往。但渐渐的他们忘记了神并且与人的女儿即 “该隐的后裔”开始交往。大洪水的记载显出神的圣洁和公义，更有祂的长久忍耐。
(1) When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, (2) the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. As time passed, what unfortunate development occurred? What were believing men making their prime criterion in the choice of a marriage partner? (3) Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years." What decision did God make about humanity at this time? Why wait 120 years?
(1)当人在世上多起来，又生女儿的时候，(2)神的儿子们看见人的女子美貌，就随意挑选，娶来为妻。随着时间的推移，发生了哪些不好的改变？对于当时那些信神的人来说，什么是他们选择伴侣的首要标准？ (3)耶和华说：“人既属乎血气，我的灵就不永远住在他里面；然而他的日子还可到一百二十年。”神对当时在地上的人做了怎样的决定？为什么要等候120年？
(4) The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. What did the people’s regard for the Nephilim indicate about the condition of the world? (Hint: Read note)
(4)那时候有伟人在地上，后来 神的儿子们和人的女子们交合生子，那就是上古英武有名的人。人们对那些伟人的敬重表明了当时的世界形势是什么样的？（提示：请看笔记）
(5) The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. What condition did God observe in people’s hearts? (6) The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. How was God affected by the wickedness of the people? (7) So the LORD said, "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them." What did God decide He would do in response to the wicked ness? (8) But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
(5)耶和华见人在地上罪恶很大，终日所思想的尽都是恶；上帝查验出人内心是怎样的状况？(6)耶和华就后悔造人在地上，心中忧伤。人的罪恶对上帝有怎样的影响？(7)耶和华说：“我要将所造的人和走兽，并昆虫，以及空中的飞鸟，都从地上除灭，因为我造他们后悔了。” 上帝决定将要怎样处置人的恶行？(8)惟有挪亚在耶和华眼前蒙恩。
(9)This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. Why would Noah find favor in the eyes of the Lord? (10) Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. Do you think Noah and his wife had a difficult job of parenting their sons? Why?
(9)挪亚的后代记在下面：挪亚是个义人，在当时的世代是个完全人。挪亚与 神同行。为什么挪亚在耶和华眼前蒙恩？(10)挪亚生了三个儿子，就是闪、含、雅弗。你认为在那时候。挪亚和他妻子教养他们孩子是否面临困难？
(11) Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. (12) God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. (13) So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. What information does God share with Noah? (14) So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. What are the rooms for? Why would Noah coat it with pitch? (15) This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. (16) Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. How many floors would the ark have? (17) I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. Describe the flood. (18) But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. What do we learn about the sons? (19) You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Why take a pair of animals with them? (20) Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. How would Noah get all of these animals? (21) You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them." What else does Noah have to bring into the ark? What do you think Noah’s neighbors thought?
(11)世界在 神面前败坏，地上满了强暴。(12)神观看世界，见是败坏了；凡有血气的人，在地上都败坏了行为。(13) 神就对挪亚说：“凡有血气的人，他的尽头已经来到我面前；因为地上满了他们的强暴，我要把他们和地一并毁灭。上帝与挪亚分享了什么样的信息？(14)你要用歌斐木造一只方舟，分一间一间的造，里外抹上松香。这些屋子是用来做什么的？挪亚为什么要里外抹上松香？(15)方舟的造法乃是这样：要长三百肘，宽五十肘，高三十肘。(16)方舟上边要留透光处，高一肘。方舟的门要开在旁边。方舟要分上、中、下三层。方舟会有几层？(17)看哪！我要使洪水泛滥在地上，毁灭天下，凡地上有血肉、有气息的活物，无一不死。描述一下洪水的情形。(18)我却要与你立约，你同你的妻，与儿子、儿妇，都要进入方舟。我们对挪亚的儿子们都知道些什么？(19)凡有血肉的活物，每样两个，一公一母，你要带进方舟，好在你那里保全生命。为什么要成对的带动物？(20)飞鸟各从其类；牲畜各从其类；地上的昆虫各从其类；每样两个，要到你那里，好保全生命。挪亚是怎样找来所有的动物的？(21)你要拿各样食物积蓄起来，好作你和它们的食物。”挪亚还要把什么带进方舟里？你觉得挪亚的邻居会怎么想？
(22) Noah did everything just as God commanded him. What type of person was Noah?
(22) 挪亚就这样行。凡 神所吩咐的，他都照样行了。挪亚是位怎样的人？
