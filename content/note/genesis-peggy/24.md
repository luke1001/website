 Genesis 32 Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau
创世纪32 雅各准备见以扫
(1) Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. (2) When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim. What encouraging experience did God grant Jacob as he journeyed back to Canaan?
1雅各仍旧行路，神的使者遇见他。2雅各看见他们就说，这是神的军兵，于是给那地方起名叫玛哈念。雅各在返回迦南的路上，上帝给了他怎样的鼓舞的经历？
(3) Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. (4) He instructed them: "This is what you are to say to my master Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. (5) I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.' " Why do you think Jacob hopes to find favor?
3雅各打发人先往西珥地去，就是以东地，见他哥哥以扫， 4吩咐他们说，你们对我主以扫说，你的仆人雅各这样说，我在拉班那里寄居，直到如今。5我有牛，驴，羊群，仆婢，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。你认为雅各为什么盼望能在他哥哥那里蒙恩？
(6) When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him." What news did Jacob’s messengers bring back about Esau?
6所打发的人回到雅各那里，说，我们到了你哥哥以扫那里，他带着四百人，正迎着你来。雅各所打发的人从以扫那里回来以后，带来了怎样的消息？
(7) In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well. (8) He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape." What precaution did Jacob take in case Esau remained angry at him and attacked him?
7雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦，便把那与他同在的人口和羊群，牛群，骆驼分作两队，         8说，以扫若来击杀这一队，剩下的那一队还可以逃避。雅各做了什么预防措施以防以扫仍然心存仇恨而要攻击他。
(9) Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,' (10) I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups. (11) Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. (12) But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.' " Identify the key elements of Jacob’s prayer to the Lord? Describe Jacob’s spiritual development
9雅各说，耶和华我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神阿，你曾对我说，回你本地本族去，我要厚待你。10你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和诚实，我一点也不配得。我先前只拿着我的杖过这约旦河，如今我却成了两队了。11     求你救我脱离我哥哥以扫的手。因为我怕他来杀我，连妻子带儿女一同杀了。12你曾说，我必定厚待你，使你的后裔如同海边的沙，多得不可胜数。雅各向上帝祈祷的要点是什么？请说明雅各的灵性进程。
(13) He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: (14) two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, (15) thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. (16) He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."
(17) He instructed the one in the lead: "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?' (18) then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.' " (19) He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. (20) And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.' "For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me." (21) So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. What further action did Jacob take in an effort to soothe Esau?
13   当夜，雅各在那里住宿，就从他所有的物中拿礼物要送给他哥哥以扫。14     母山羊二百只，公山羊二十只，母绵羊二百只，公绵羊二十只， 15奶崽子的骆驼三十只各带着崽子，母牛四十只，公牛十只，母驴二十匹，驴驹十匹。16每样各分一群，交在仆人手下，就对仆人说，你们要在我前头过去，使群群相离，有空闲的地方。17又吩咐尽先走的说，我哥哥以扫遇见你的时候，问你说，你是哪家的人，要往哪里去，你前头这些是谁的，18           你就说，是你仆人雅各的，是送给我主以扫的礼物。他自己也在我们后边。       19又吩咐第二，第三，和一切赶群畜的人说，你们遇见以扫的时候也要这样对他说。20并且你们要说，你仆人雅各在我们后边。因雅各心里说，我借着在我前头去的礼物解他的恨，然后再见他的面，或者他容纳我。21于是礼物先过去了。那夜，雅各在队中住宿。雅各为安慰以扫又采取了什么行动？

Jacob Wrestles With God
(22) That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. (23) After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. (24) So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. (25) When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. In your opinion, why did God take a human form and wrestle all night with Jacob? (Hint: Jacob had struggled all of his life, first with Esau, then with Laban. Who held Jacob’s future in His hands?) (26) Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me." What does Jacob acknowledge?
22他夜间起来，带着两个妻子，两个使女，并十一个儿子，都过了雅博渡口，23先打发他们过河，又打发所有的都过去，24只剩下雅各一人。有一个人来和他摔跤，直到黎明。25那人见自己胜不过他，就将他的大腿窝摸了一把，雅各的大腿窝正在摔跤的时候就扭了。你认为，为什么上帝要用人的形象在夜里来和雅各摔跤？（提示：雅各一生都在努力奋斗，先是和以扫，然后和拉班。雅各的未来掌管在谁的手中？）26那人说，天黎明了，容我去吧。雅各说，你不给我祝福，我就不容你去。雅各认识到了什么？
(27) The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
(28) Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome." What was the outcome of this mysterious physical and spiritual wrestling match?
(29) Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there. (30) So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared." Do you think Jacob really saw God’s face?
(31) The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip. (32) Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched
27那人说，你名叫什么？他说，我名叫雅各。       
28那人说，你的名不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列。因为你与神与人较力，都得了胜。这场充满奥秘，在肉体及灵性上的摔跤竞赛的结局如何？
29雅各问他说，请将你的名告诉我。那人说，何必问我的名，于是在那里给雅各祝福。30雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒（就是神之面的意思），意思说，我面对面见了神，我的性命仍得保全。你认为雅各真的看到了神的面吗？
31日头刚出来的时候，雅各经过毗努伊勒，他的大腿就瘸了。32         故此，以色列人不吃大腿窝的筋，直到今日，因为那人摸了雅各大腿窝的筋。

NOTES注释

Genesis 33 Jacob Meets Esau
创世纪33 雅各会见以扫

(1) Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants. (2) He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. What do you think of Jacob’s strategy in the way he arranged his family to meet his brother Esau? (3) He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.  (4) But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. (5) Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."
1雅各举目观看，见以扫来了，后头跟着四百人，他就把孩子们分开交给利亚，拉结，和两个使女，2            并且叫两个使女和她们的孩子在前头，利亚和她的孩子在后头，拉结和约瑟在尽后头。雅各特意安排了他的家人去见以扫的顺序，你对他这样的策略有何想法？3他自己在他们前头过去，一连七次俯伏在地才就近他哥哥。4以扫跑来迎接他，将他抱住，又搂着他的颈项，与他亲嘴，两个人就哭了。5以扫举目看见妇人孩子，就说，这些和你同行的是谁呢？雅各说，这些孩子是神施恩给你的仆人的。
(6) Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down. (7) Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. (8) Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.
(9) But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."
(10) "No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. (11) Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. (12) Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you." How would you describe Jacob meeting Esau? How would you describe Esau meeting Jacob? What changes had God worked in the hearts of these two brothers?
6于是两个使女和她们的孩子前来下拜。       7利亚和她的孩子也前来下拜。随后约瑟和拉结也前来下拜。8以扫说，我所遇见的这些群畜是什么意思呢？雅各说，是要在我主面前蒙恩的。9以扫说，兄弟阿，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧。
10雅各说，不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物。因为我见了你的面，如同见了神的面，并且你容纳了我。11求你收下我带来给你的礼物。因为神恩待我，使我充足。雅各再三地求他，他才收下了。12以扫说，我们可以起身前往，我在你前头走。你会怎样形容雅各去见以扫？你又会怎样形容以扫与雅各的相见？上帝在两兄弟的心中做了怎样的改变？
(13) But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. (14) So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir." (15) Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."
(16) So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. (17) Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.
(18) After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. (19) For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. (20) There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel. What does Jacob acknowledge?
13 雅各对他说，我主知道孩子们年幼娇嫩，牛羊也正在乳养的时候，若是催赶一天，群畜都必死了。14求我主在仆人前头走，我要量着在我面前群畜和孩子的力量慢慢地前行，直走到西珥我主那里。15以扫说，容我把跟随我的人留几个在你这里。雅各说，何必呢？只要在我主眼前蒙恩就是了。
16于是，以扫当日起行，回往西珥去了。17雅各就往疏割去，在那里为自己盖造房屋，又为牲畜搭棚。因此那地方名叫疏割（就是棚的意思）。
18雅各从巴旦亚兰回来的时候，平平安安地到了迦南地的示剑城，在城东支搭帐棚，19就用一百块银子向示剑的父亲，哈抹的子孙买了支帐棚的那块地，20在那里筑了一座坛，起名叫伊利伊罗伊以色列（就是神，以色列神的意思）。雅各在感谢什么？
