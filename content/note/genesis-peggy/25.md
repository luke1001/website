Genesis 34 Dinah and the Shechemites 创世纪34章 底拿和示剑人

Genesis 34 Dinah and the Shechemites
创世纪34章底拿和示剑人

(1) Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. (2) When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and violated her. What great offense occurred with Jacob’s daughter, Dinah, while the family was living in Shechem? (3) His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her. (4) And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife." Why would Shechem go to his father to get Dinah as his wife?
1利亚给雅各所生的女儿底拿出去，要见那地的女子们。2那地的主希未人，哈抹的儿子示剑看见她，就拉住她，与她行淫，玷辱她。当雅各家住在示剑的时候，他的女儿底拿，受到了什么极大的侵害？3示剑的心系恋雅各的女儿底拿，喜爱这女子，甜言蜜语地安慰她。4示剑对他父亲哈抹说，求你为我聘这女子为妻。为什么示剑要求父亲为他聘底拿为妻？
(5) When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about it until they came home. Why would Jacob discuss Dinah being defiled with his sons?
5雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿。那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野，雅各就闭口不言，等他们回来。为什么雅各要和儿子们一起商讨底拿被玷污的事？
(6) Then Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob. (7) Now Jacob's sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter—a thing that should not be done.
            (8) But Hamor said to them, "My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. (9) Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves. (10) You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it." What do you think the Hamor (a Canaanite) really wanted?
6示剑的父亲哈抹出来见雅各，要和他商议。7        雅各的儿子们听见这事，就从田野回来，人人忿恨，十分恼怒。因示剑在以色列家作了丑事，与雅各的女儿行淫，这本是不该作的事。
8哈抹和他们商议说，我儿子示剑的心恋慕这女子，求你们将她给我的儿子为妻。9你们与我们彼此结亲。你们可以把女儿给我们，也可以娶我们的女儿。    10你们与我们同住吧。这地都在你们面前，只管在此居住，作买卖，置产业。你认为哈抹（一个迦南人）实际想要得到什么？
(11) Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask. (12) Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife." What offer did the ruler Hamor and his son, Shechem, make to Jacob and his family?
11示剑对女儿的父亲和弟兄们说，但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我必给你们。12任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们所说的给你们。只要把女子给我为妻。那地的主人哈抹和他的儿子示剑，给予雅各家什么样的承诺？
(13) Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor. What word is used to describe how Jacob’s sons replied?  (14) They said to them, "We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. (15) We will give our consent to you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males. (16) Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We'll settle among you and become one people with you. (17) But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we'll take our sister and go." What counter-proposal did Jacob’s sons make?
13雅各的儿子们因为示剑玷污了他们的妹子底拿，就用诡诈的话回答示剑和他父亲哈抹，（这里）用了什么的词语来形容雅各儿子们的回答？14对他们说，我们不能把我们的妹子给没有受割礼的人为妻，因为那是我们的羞辱。15惟有一件才可以应允，若你们所有的男丁都受割礼，和我们一样，16我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿。我们便与你们同住，两下成为一样的人民。17倘若你们不听从我们受割礼，我们就带着妹子走了。雅各的儿子们提出了怎样的一份替代协议？
            (18) Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. (19) The young man, who was the most honored of all his father's household, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. (20) So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen. (21) "These men are friendly toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. (22) But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. (23) Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us." How did Hamor and Shechem appeal to their townsmen to agree to the proposal that they be circumcised?
            18哈抹和他的儿子示剑喜欢这话。19那少年人作这事并不迟延，因为他喜爱雅各的女儿。他在他父亲家中也是人最尊重的。20       哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口，对本城的人说，21这些人与我们和睦，不如许他们在这地居住，作买卖。这地也宽阔，足可容下他们。我们可以娶他们的女儿为妻，也可以把我们的女儿嫁给他们。22惟有一件事我们必须作，他们才肯应允和我们同住，成为一样的人民，就是我们中间所有的男丁都要受割礼，和他们一样。23他们的群畜，货财，和一切的牲口岂不都归我们吗？只要依从他们，他们就与我们同住。哈抹和示剑是怎样请求本城的人同意受割礼的协议的？
(24) All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. (25) Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. (26) They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. (27) The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled. (28) They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. (29) They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. What calculated, brutal action did Dinah’s brothers take against the Schechemites?
24凡从城门出入的人就都听从哈抹和他儿子示剑的话。于是凡从城门出入的男丁都受了割礼。25到第三天，众人正在疼痛的时候，雅各的两个儿子，就是底拿的哥哥西缅和利未，各拿刀剑，趁着众人想不到的时候来到城中，把一切男丁都杀了，26又用刀杀了哈抹和他儿子示剑，把底拿从示剑家里带出来就走了。27雅各的儿子们因为他们的妹子受了玷污，就来到被杀的人那里，掳掠那城，28      夺了他们的羊群，牛群，和驴，并城里田间所有的。29又把他们一切货财，孩子，妇女，并各房中所有的，都掳掠去了。底拿的哥哥们采用了怎样有预谋、残忍的行动来对待示剑人的？
(30) Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed." Why was Jacob angry?
30雅各对西缅和利未说，你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中，就是在迦南人和比利洗人中，有了臭名。我的人丁既然稀少，他们必聚集来击杀我，我和全家的人都必灭绝。雅各为什么生气？
(31) But they replied, "Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?"
If Jacob were living today, how would the rape be handled?
31他们说，他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女吗？如果雅各生活在现在，这样的暴行将被怎样处理？
