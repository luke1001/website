Genesis 35-36 创世纪35-36

Genesis 35 Jacob Returns to Bethel
创世纪35 雅各回伯特利
            The transaction that had taken place (Genesis 34) made it unsafe for Jacob to dwell any longer at the city of Shechem; and it seems that while he was reflecting on the horrible act of Simeon and Levi, and not knowing what to do, God graciously appeared to him, and commanded him to go up to Beth-el, build an altar there, and thus perform the vow he had made, Genesis 28:20,22.
所发生的转变（创世纪34）使得雅各不能再住在示剑城；正当他思想西缅和利未所作的恶行，不知道该如何做时，神满有恩赐地向他显现，指示他去到伯特利，并在那里筑坛，以此实现他对神所许的愿（创世纪28：20，22）。

(1) Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau." Why do you think God asked Jacob to remember the vow? [Genesis 28: 20-22 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear (21) so that I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God (22) and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."] What vow had Jacob made ten years earlier? (2) So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. What was Jacob asking of his household? (3) Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone." (4) So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears [not for the purpose of ornament], and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. Why do you think Jacob had the symbols of idolatry buried?  (5) Then they set out, and the terror of God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. Jacob and his family were allowed to travel in peace. This was a distance of about 20 miles (32 km).
35:1神对雅各说，起来。上伯特利去，住在那里。要在那里筑一座坛给神，就是你逃避你哥哥以扫的时候向你显现的那位。你认为神为什么要雅各记起他对神所许的愿？【创世纪28:20雅各许愿说，神若与我同在，在我所行的路上保佑我，又给我食物吃，衣服穿，28:21使我平平安安地回到我父亲的家，我就必以耶和华为我的神。28:22我所立为柱子的石头也必作神的殿，凡你所赐给我的，我必将十分之一献给你。】35:2雅各就对他家中的人并一切与他同在的人说，你们要除掉你们中间的外邦神，也要自洁，更换衣裳。雅各要对他家中的人说什么？35:3我们要起来，上伯特利去，在那里我要筑一座坛给神，就是在我遭难的日子应允我的祷告，在我行的路上保佑我的那位。35:4他们就把外邦人的神像和他们耳朵上的环子【不是装饰所用】交给雅各。雅各都藏在示剑那里的橡树底下。你认为雅各为什么把这些象征着拜偶像的物品全都埋了？35:5他们便起行前往。神使那周围城邑的人都甚惊惧，就不追赶雅各的众子了。雅各和他的家人可以平安地行走。大概有20英里（32公里）远的路程。
(6) Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. (7) There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. Why had Jacob fled from his brother, Esau? [Genesis 27: 41 (41) Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."]
35:6于是雅各和一切与他同在的人到了迦南地的路斯，就是伯特利。35:7他在那里筑了一座坛，就给那地方起名叫伊勒伯特利（就是伯特利之神的意思），因为他逃避他哥哥的时候，神在那里向他显现。雅各为什么要逃离他的哥哥以扫？【创世纪27：41以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福，就怨恨雅各，心里说，为我父亲居丧的日子近了，到那时候，我要杀我的兄弟雅各。】     
(8) Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth. What do we learn about Rebekah's nurse? (9) After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. (10) God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel. " So he named him Israel. What was Jacob's new name? What does it mean?
35:8利百加的奶母底波拉死了，就葬在伯特利下边橡树底下。那棵树名叫亚伦巴古。关于利百加的奶母我们了解到了什么？35:9雅各从巴旦亚兰回来，神又向他显现，赐福与他，35:10且对他说，你的名原是雅各，从今以后不要再叫雅各，要叫以色列。这样，他就改名叫以色列。雅各的新名字叫什么？这个新名字有什么意思？
(11) And God said to him, "I am God Almighty ; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body. (12) The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you." (13) Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. What blessing did God remind Israel?
35:11神又对他说，我是全能的神。你要生养众多，将来有一族和多国的民从你而生，又有君王从你而出。35:12我所赐给亚伯拉罕和以撒的地，我要赐给你与你的后裔。35:13神就从那与雅各说话的地方升上去了。神再次告诉以色列祂要怎样赐福与他？
(14) Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. (15) Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel. What does the name Bethel mean?
35:14雅各便在那里立了一根石柱，在柱子上奠酒，浇油。35:15雅各就给那地方起名叫伯特利。伯特利这个名字有什么意思？

The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac 拉结与以撒之死
(16) Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty. (17) And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you have another son." For what had Rachel prayed after Joseph was born? [Genesis 30:24 (24) She named him Joseph, and said, "May the Lord add to me another son."] (18) As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.  What does Ben-Oni mean? What does Benjamin mean? (19) So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).  By what name do we know Ephrath? (20) Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb.
35:16他们从伯特利起行，离以法他还有一段路程，拉结临产甚是艰难。35:17正在艰难的时候，收生婆对她说，不要怕，你又要得一个儿子了。约瑟出生后拉结为什么而祷告？【创世纪30：24就给他起名叫约瑟（就是增添的意思），意思说，愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子。】35:18她将近于死，灵魂要走的时候，就给她儿子起名叫便俄尼。他父亲却给他起名叫便雅悯。便俄尼的意思是什么？便雅悯的意思什么？35:19拉结死了，葬在以法他的路旁。以法他就是伯利恒。以法他还有什么别的名字？35:20雅各在她的坟上立了一统碑，就是拉结的墓碑，到今日还在。
 (21) Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. (22) While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Who was Bilah? What was Reuben trying to claim?
35:21以色列起行前往，在以得台那边支搭帐棚。35:22以色列住在那地的时候，流便去与他父亲的妾辟拉同寝，以色列也听见了。雅各共有十二个儿子。辟拉是谁？流遍想要得到什么？

Jacob had twelve sons雅各有十二个儿子:
(23) The sons of Leah: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.
            (24) The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
(25) The sons of Rachel's maidservant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.
(26) The sons of Leah's maidservant Zilpah: Gad and Asher.
These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
            (27) Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. (28) Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years. (29) Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. What happened when Isaac died? Who buried Isaac?
35:23利亚所生的是雅各的长子流便，还有西缅，利未，犹大，以萨迦，西布伦。
35:24拉结所生的是约瑟，便雅悯。
35:25拉结的使女辟拉所生的是但，拿弗他利。
35:26利亚的使女悉帕所生的是迦得，亚设。这是雅各在巴旦亚兰所生的儿子。
35:27雅各来到他父亲以撒那里，到了基列亚巴的幔利，乃是亚伯拉罕和以撒寄居的地方。基列亚巴就是希伯仑。35:28以撒共活了一百八十岁。35:29以撒年纪老迈，日子满足，气绝而死，归到他列祖（原文作本民）那里。他两个儿子以扫，雅各把他埋葬了。以撒死时发生了什么事情？谁埋葬了以撒？

Genesis 36 Esau's Descendants
创世纪36 以扫的后裔
            (1) This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom).
(2) Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite- (3) also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
(4) Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, (5) and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.
(6) Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob. (7) Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock. (8) So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
(9) This is the account of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
(10) These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
            (11) The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.

(20) These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, (21) Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs.
            (22) The sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam. Timna was Lotan's sister.
(23) The sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam.

The Rulers of Edom
(31) These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned:
            (32) Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah. (33) When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
            (34) When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
(35) When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith.
