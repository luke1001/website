Genesis 4 Cain and Abel 创世纪第4章 该隐和亚伯

Genesis 4 Cain and Abel
创世纪第4章 该隐和亚伯
This chapter reports the early development that took place in the human race. The story of Cain and Abel shows the working of sin.
这一章记录了发生在人类早期的事件。该隐和亚伯的故事揭示罪的活动。

(1) Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man." What beliefs did Eve express in the birth of her first child?(hint: look at the meaning of Cain’s name) (2) Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. What were the sons’ jobs? (3) In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. What type of offering did Cain bring? (4) But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. How was Abel’s offering different? (hint: what does it mean to give the firstborn?) The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, (5) but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. Why would the Lord look on favor at Abel’s offering and not on Cain’s offering? So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. What was the real reason Cain was very angry?
(1)有一日，那人和他妻子夏娃同房，夏娃就怀孕，生了该隐(就是“得”的意思)，便说：“耶和华使我得了一个男子。”当夏娃生头一个孩子时她表达了怎样的信念？（提示：请看该隐名字的意义）(2)又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的，该隐是种地的。所生的儿子们在从事什么职业呢？(3)有一日，该隐拿地里的出产为供物献给耶和华；该隐带来了什么样的供物？(4)亚伯也将他羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。亚伯的供物有什么不同？（提示：献上头生的意味着什么？）耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物；(5)只是看不中该隐和他的供物；耶和华为什么会看中亚伯的供物而没有看中该隐的？该隐就大大地发怒，变了脸色。使该隐发怒的真实原因是什么？

(6) Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? Why did the Lord ask this question of Cain? (7)If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it." How did God attempt to help Cain overcome his unbelief and anger? (8) Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." Why would Abel willingly go out into the field with Cain? And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. What had Cain been plotting all along?
(6)耶和华对该隐说：“你为什么发怒呢？你为什么变了脸色呢？耶和华为什么向该隐问这些问题呢？(7)你若行得好，岂不蒙悦纳？你若行得不好，罪就伏在门前；它必恋慕你，你却要制伏它。”神是怎样帮助该隐胜过他自己的不信和怒气的？(8)该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话，亚伯为什么愿意与该隐到田间去？二人正在田间；该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了。该隐早已密谋了什么？

(9) Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. Why is God asking Cain the question when clearly He knows what happened to Abel? "Am I my brother's keeper?" What does Cain’s answer tell us? (10) The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. (11) Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. (12) When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth." How would Cain spend his life?
(9)耶和华对该隐说：“你兄弟亚伯在哪里？”他说：“我不知道！为什么神向该隐问这个问题既然祂极清楚亚伯已被害了？我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”该隐的回答告诉了我们什么？(10)耶和华说：“你作了什么事呢？你兄弟的血，有声音从地里向我哀告。(11)地开了口，从你手里接受你兄弟的血；现在你必从这地受咒诅。(12)你种地，地不再给你效力；你必流离飘荡在地上。”该隐将怎样度过他的余生？

(13) Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear. Of what is Cain accusing God? (14) Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me." What was Cain worried about? What was Cain not worried about? (15) But the LORD said to him, "Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." What did God show Cain? Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. (16) So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
(13)该隐对耶和华说：“我的刑罚太重，过于我所能当的。该隐指责上帝什么？(14)你如今赶逐我离开这地，以致不见你面；我必流离飘荡在地上，凡遇见我的必杀我。”该隐担心的是什么？不担心的是什么？(15)耶和华对他说：“凡杀该隐的必遭报七倍。”上帝向该隐显明了什么？耶和华就给该隐立一个记号，免得人遇见他就杀他。(16) 于是该隐离开耶和华的面，去住在伊甸东边挪得之地。

Note: In the early days it was necessary for brothers and sisters to marry.
注解：在起初的世代兄弟姐妹之间结婚是可行的。

(17) Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. Why would Cain name a city after his son? (18) To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
(17)该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺。该隐建造了一座城，就按着他儿子的名，将那城叫作以诺。为什么该隐以他儿子的名命名这城？(18) 以诺生以拿；以拿生米户雅利；米户雅利生玛土撒利；玛土撒利生拉麦。

(19) Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. What is this the first example of? (20) Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. (21) His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. (22) Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of [g] bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. How many generations are listed? What does the number mean? What type of relation did Cain’s descendents have with God?
(19)拉麦娶了两个妻：一个名叫亚大，一个名叫洗拉。这是什么事情的先例？(20)亚大生雅八；雅八就是住帐棚牧养牲畜之人的祖师。(21) 雅八的兄弟名叫犹八，他是一切弹琴吹箫之人的祖师。(22)洗拉又生了土八该隐，他是打造各样铜铁利器的(或作“是铜匠铁匠的祖师”)。土八该隐的妹子是拿玛。这里记载了几代人？这个数字有什么含义？该隐的后裔和神又怎样的关系？

(23)Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. (24) If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times." Far from feeling remorse, of what does Lamech boast?
(23)拉麦对他两个妻子说：“亚大、洗拉，听我的声音；拉麦的妻子细听我的话语：壮年人伤我，我把他杀了；少年人损我，我把他害了。(24) 若杀该隐，遭报七倍；杀拉麦，必遭报七十七倍。”既不悔恨，拉麦又以什么夸口呢？

(25) Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." (26) Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord. The names of other children of Adam and Eve are not mentioned, only that of Seth, who took the place of the first-born. The family of Seth was the family of believers.
(25)亚当又与妻子同房，她就生了一个儿子，起名叫塞特。意思说： 神另给我立了一个儿子代替亚伯，因为该隐杀了他。(26)塞特也生了一个儿子，起名叫以挪士。那时候，人才求告耶和华的名。除了塞特，圣经没有提及亚当和夏娃所生其他孩子的名字，塞特代替了头生的。塞特的家庭就是信靠神的家庭。

NOTES注释
Cain – The name means “gain, possession”. In Hebrew it is translated “I have the Man, the Lord”. Adam and Eve thought that Cain was the promised one.
该隐－这个名字的意思是“得到，占有”在希伯来语中被译为“我得了那人，主”。亚当和夏娃认为该隐就是神所应许的。
Abel – The name means “breath” or “temporary”.
亚伯－这个名字的意思是“呼吸”或“暂存的”
Under a curse – The ground had been cursed because of human sin (Adam) and now Cain himself is cursed. Formerly he had worked the ground, and it had produced life for him. Now the ground, soaked with his brother’s blood, would no longer yield for him its produce.
受咒诅－地人类（亚当）的罪而受咒诅，而现在该隐自己被咒诅。从前他要在地上做工，地也为他出产。现在地浸透了他兄弟的血，将不再出产给他。
Land of Nod – Nod means wandering.
挪得之地－挪得的意思是徘徊、偏离正道。

(32) After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth. How does Noah’s age compare to his ancestor’s age when he had children?
(32)挪亚五百岁生了闪、含、雅弗。挪亚有孩子的年纪和他先祖比起来有什么不同？
At times the names can be confusing as many of Cain’s and Seth’s descendents have names that are very similar.
有时该隐后裔的名字和塞特后裔的名字会因为非常相似而混淆。

Notice that Adam lived to see Lamech born. In this way it was possible to transmit the history of creation and the human race from the mouth of Adam. Many of the old patriarchs before the Flood lived together at the same time and together taught their children.
