Genesis 40 The Cupbearer and the Baker
创世纪40 酒政和膳长
            At the time of Joseph, Egypt had a well-established government. They had one of the first stable governments on record. The religion was primarily a worship of the heavenly bodies, the sun god, and his wife, the goddess of the moon.
约瑟在埃及时，埃及是由一个完善的政府所管理。这是埃及历史上第一个稳固的政权。埃及人主要信仰天体，太阳神和他的妻子，月亮神。

(1) Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt. (2) Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, (3) and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. Who was the captain of the guard? (4) The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. How did Joseph come to meet the king's cupbearer and baker?
            40:1这事以后，埃及王的酒政和膳长得罪了他们的主埃及王，40:2法老就恼怒酒政和膳长这二臣，40:3把他们下在护卫长府内的监里，就是约瑟被囚的地方。谁是护卫长？40:4护卫长把他们交给约瑟，约瑟便伺候他们。约瑟怎么会来见到王的酒政和膳长的？
After they had been in custody for some time, (5) each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. (6) When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. What did Joseph notice? (7) So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"
他们有些日子在监里。40:5被囚在监之埃及王的酒政和膳长二人同夜各作一梦，各梦都有讲解。40:6到了早晨，约瑟进到他们那里，见他们有愁闷的样子。约瑟注意到了什么？40:7他便问法老的二臣，就是与他同囚在他主人府里的，说，他们今日为什么面带愁容呢？
(8) "We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams." What did Joseph remind the prisoners? How did Joseph offer help to the troubled men?
40:8他们对他说，我们各人作了一梦，没有人能解。约瑟说，解梦不是出于神吗？请你们将梦告诉我。约瑟是怎样提示这两个囚犯的？约瑟提出要如何帮助他们？

(9) So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, (10) and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. (11) Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his hand."
40:9酒政便将他的梦告诉约瑟说，我梦见在我面前有一棵葡萄树，40:10树上有三根枝子，好像发了芽，开了花，上头的葡萄都成熟了。40:11法老的杯在我手中，我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里，将杯递在他手中。
(12) "This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days. (13) Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. What was the cupbearer's dream and its meaning? (14) But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. (15) For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon." What favor did Joseph ask of the cupbearer? Why? Why does Joseph think the cup bearer will be sympathetic to his false imprisonment?
40:12约瑟对他说，他所作的梦是这样解，三根枝子就是三天。40:13三天之内，法老必提你出监，叫你官复原职，你仍要递杯在法老的手中，和先前作他的酒政一样。酒政做了什么梦？这梦有什么意思？40:14但你得好处的时候，求你记念我，施恩与我，在法老面前提说我，救我出这监牢。40:15我实在是从希伯来人之地被拐来的。我在这里也没有作过什么，叫他们把我下在监里。约瑟要酒政怎么帮他？为什么？为什么约瑟认为酒政会对约瑟含冤入狱有所同情？
(16) When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread. (17) In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head." (18) "This is what it means," Joseph said. "The three baskets are three days. (19) Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat away your flesh."  What was the baker's dream and its meaning?
40:16膳长见梦解得好，就对约瑟说，我在梦中见我头上顶着三筐白饼。40:17极上的筐子里有为法老烤的各样食物，有飞鸟来吃我头上筐子里的食物。40:18约瑟说，你的梦是这样解，三个筐子就是三天。40:19三天之内，法老必斩断你的头，把你挂在木头上，必有飞鸟来吃你身上的肉。膳长做了什么梦？这梦有什么意思？
(20) Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: (21) He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand, (22) but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. How were the messages of these men's dreams fulfilled?
40:20到了第三天，是法老的生日，他为众臣仆设摆筵席，把酒政和膳长提出监来，40:21使酒政官复原职，他仍旧递杯在法老手中。40:22但把膳长挂起来，正如约瑟向他们所解的话。这两人所做的梦是如何成真的？
(23) The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him. What disappointment did Joseph have to endure after the cupbearer was restored to his position? Why might the cupbearer have forgotten Joseph?
40:23酒政却不记念约瑟，竟忘了他。酒政官复原职后，约瑟为了什么而感到失望？酒政为什么会把约瑟给忘了？
            What effect for good or bad do you think these afflictions (sold into slavery, wrongfully sent to prison, forgotten by the cupbearer) had on Joseph's faith and outlook on life?
你认为约瑟所经历的这些苦难（被卖到埃及为奴，被冤枉而下到监狱里，被酒政遗忘）对他的信心和人生观有什么好的或不好的影响？

Notes注释
Cupbearer - The cupbearer's duty was to press the juice out of the grape berries, fill the cup, bring it to the king, and take the first sip to assure the king that the cup contained no poison.
酒政 ---酒政的工作是压葡萄成汁，将杯盛满葡萄汁，拿给王，并尝第一口确保酒中无毒。

No one to interpret - The interpretation of dreams (future events) belonged to a special class of men. The prisoners were unable to consult an interpreter and this caused them distress.
没有人能解 ---只有一群特别的人才会解梦（未来的事情）。囚犯无法求助于解梦师，这使得他们忧愁。

Hang you on a tree - The Egyptians embalmed the bodies of the dead, and therefore it was considered a great shame to have a corpse devoured by ravenous birds.
把你挂在木头上 ---埃及人一般用药物保存尸体，所以尸体被乌鸦叼食过被认为是一个极大的羞辱。

Pharaoh's birthday - This was a special time when the king/pharaoh could grant pardons to certain criminals.
法老的生日 ---在这个特别的日子，王/法老可以特赦某些囚犯。

Genesis 41 Pharaoh's Dreams
创世纪41 法老的梦

(1) When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile, (2) when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds. (3) After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank. (4) And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. Describe the first dream.
41:1过了两年，法老作梦，梦见自己站在河边，41:2有七只母牛从河里上来，又美好又肥壮，在芦荻中吃草。41:3随后又有七只母牛从河里上来，又丑陋又干瘦，与那七只母牛一同站在河边。41:4这又丑陋又干瘦的七只母牛吃尽了那又美好又肥壮的七只母牛。法老就醒了。请描述法老的第一个梦。
(5) He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. (6) After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind. (7) The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. Describe the second dream.
41:5他又睡着，第二回作梦，梦见一棵麦子长了七个穗子，又肥大又佳美，41:6随后又长了七个穗子，又细弱又被东风吹焦了。41:7这细弱的穗子吞了那七个又肥大又饱满的穗子。法老醒了，不料是个梦。请描述法老的第二个梦。
(8) In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. What is significant about the fact that neither Pharaoh's wise men , nor his magicians could interpret his dreams? (9) Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my shortcomings. (10) Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. (11) Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. (12) Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. (13) And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. " Who stepped forward to help both his king and Joseph? Do you think the cupbearer really cared about Joseph?
41:8到了早晨，法老心里不安，就差人召了埃及所有的术士和博士来。法老就把所作的梦告诉他们，却没有人能给法老圆解。法老的术士和博士都不能为他解梦，这一点为什么很重要？41:9那时酒政对法老说，我今日想起我的罪来。41:10从前法老恼怒臣仆，把我和膳长下在护卫长府布的监里。41:11我们二人同夜各作一梦，各梦都有讲解。41:12在那里同着我们有一个希伯来的少年人，是护卫长的仆人，我们告诉他，他就把我们的梦圆解，是按着各人的梦圆解的。41:13后来正如他给我们圆解的成就了。我官复原职，膳长被挂起来了。是谁站出来帮助了王和约瑟？你认为酒政真的是关心约瑟吗？
(14) So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. To whom is Joseph brought? (15) Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it." (16) "I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires." What does Joseph explain to Pharaoh about his ability to interpret dreams?
41:14法老遂即差人去召约瑟，他们便急忙带他出监，他就剃头，刮脸，换衣裳，进到法老面前。约瑟被带去见谁？41:15法老对约瑟说，我作了一梦，没有人能解。我听见人说，你听了梦就能解。41:16约瑟回答法老说，这不在乎我，神必将平安的话回答法老。约瑟是如何向法老解释他解梦的能力的？
(17) Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, (18) when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. (19) After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. How does Pharaoh describe the cows? (20) The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. (21) But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
41:17法老对约瑟说，我梦见我站在河边，41:18有七只母牛从河里上来，又肥壮又美好，在芦荻中吃草。41:19随后又有七只母牛上来，又软弱又丑陋又干瘦，在埃及遍地，我没有见过这样不好的。法老如何来描述母牛的？41:20这又干瘦又丑陋的母牛吃尽了那以先的七只肥母牛，41:21吃了以后却看不出是吃了，那丑陋的样子仍旧和先前一样。我就醒了。   
(22) "In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. (23) After them, seven other heads sprouted—withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. (24) The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me." Who were the magicians?
41:22我又梦见一棵麦子，长了七个穗子，又饱满又佳美，41:23随后又长了七个穗子，枯槁细弱，被东风吹焦了。41:24这些细弱的穗子吞了那七个佳美的穗子。我将这梦告诉了术士，却没有人能给我解说。术士是谁？
(25) Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. How does Joseph begin the explanation of the dreams? (26) The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. (27) The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.
41:25约瑟对法老说，法老的梦乃是一个。神已将所要作的事指示法老了。约瑟是如何开始解梦的？41:26七只好母牛是七年，七个好穗子也是七年。这梦乃是一个。41:27那随后上来的七只又干瘦又丑陋的母牛是七年，那七个虚空，被东风吹焦的穗子也是七年，都是七个荒年。
(28) "It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. (29) Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, (30) but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. (31) The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. (32) The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. What was the meaning of Pharaoh's dreams? What do verses 25, 28, and 32 have in common?
41:28这就是我对法老所说，神已将所要作的事显明给法老了。41:29埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，41:30随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收，全地必被饥荒所灭。41:31因那以后的饥荒甚大，便不觉得先前的丰收了。41:32至于法老两回作梦，是因神命定这事，而且必速速成就。法老的梦指的是什么意思？第25，28和32节有什么相似之处？
(33) "And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. (34) Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. (35) They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. (36) This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine." What advice did Joseph offer Pharaoh to prepare for the seven years of famine?
41:33所以，法老当拣选一个有聪明有智慧的人，派他治理埃及地。41:34法老当这样行，又派官员管理这地。当七个丰年的时候，征收埃及地的五分之一，41:35叫他们把将来丰年一切的粮食聚敛起来，积蓄五谷，收存在各城里作食物，归于法老的手下。41:36所积蓄的粮食可以防备埃及地将来的七个荒年，免得这地被饥荒所灭。约瑟向法老提出了什么建议来为七个荒年做准备？
(37) The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. (38) So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?" (39) Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. How does Pharaoh describe Joseph? (40) You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you." What authority does Pharaoh give to Joseph?

Joseph in Charge of Egypt It is thought that Joseph came to be second in command around 1876 B.C.
41:37法老和他一切臣仆都以这事为妙。41:38法老对臣仆说，像这样的人，有神的灵在他里头，我们岂能找得着呢？41:39法老对约瑟说，神既将这事都指示你，可见没有人象你这样有聪明有智慧。法老认为约瑟是什么样的人？41:40你可以掌管我的家。我的民都必听从你的话。惟独在宝座上我比你大。法老授予约瑟什么权利？
约瑟掌管埃及约瑟大约是在公元前1876年左右成为埃及法老的副手的。

(41) So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt." (42) Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. (43) He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. What steps did Pharaoh take to firmly establish Joseph as the second-in-charge in the land of Egypt?
41:41法老又对约瑟说，我派你治理埃及全地。41:42法老就摘下手上打印的戒指，戴在约瑟的手上，给他穿上细麻衣，把金链戴在他的颈项上，41:43又叫约瑟坐他的副车，喝道的在前呼叫说，跪下。这样，法老派他治理埃及全地。法老做了哪几步来巩固建立约瑟为埃及地的第二把手？
(44) Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt." (45) Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. Why would Joseph go throughout Egypt?
41:44法老对约瑟说，我是法老，在埃及全地，若没有你的命令，不许人擅自办事（原文作动手动脚）。41:45法老赐名给约瑟，叫撒发那忒巴内亚，又将安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给他为妻。约瑟就出去巡行埃及地。约瑟为什么要巡行埃及地？
(46) Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. How old was Joseph when he was sold into slavery? And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt. (47) During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. (48) Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. (49) Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. What activities did Joseph undertake during the first seven years of his administration?
41:46约瑟见埃及王法老的时候年三十岁。他从法老面前出去，遍行埃及全地。约瑟被卖为奴时，他几岁？41:47七个丰年之内，地的出产极丰极盛（原文作一把一把的），41:48约瑟聚敛埃及地七个丰年一切的粮食，把粮食积存在各城里。各城周围田地的粮食都积存在本城里。41:49约瑟积蓄五谷甚多，如同海边的沙，无法计算，因为谷不可胜数。在他在位的头七年，约瑟都做了哪些事？
(50) Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. (51) Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household." (52) The second son he named Ephraim and said, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering." What did Joseph still remember?
41:50荒年未到以前，安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给约瑟生了两个儿子。41:51约瑟给长子起名叫玛拿西（就是使之忘了的意思），因为他说，神使我忘了一切的困苦和我父的全家。41:52他给次子起名叫以法莲（就是使之昌盛的意思），因为他说，神使我在受苦的地方昌盛。约瑟还对什么记忆犹新？
(53) The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, (54) and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. (55) When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you." To whom were the people to turn for help?
41:53埃及地的七个丰年一完，41:54七个荒年就来了。正如约瑟所说的，各地都有饥荒。惟独埃及全地有粮食。41:55及至埃及全地有了饥荒，众民向法老哀求粮食，法老对他们说，你们往约瑟那里去，凡他所说的，你们都要作。人们都向谁求救？
(56) When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. (57) And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world. How had God positioned Joseph?
            41:56当时饥荒遍满天下，约瑟开了各处的仓，粜粮给埃及人。在埃及地饥荒甚大。41:57各地的人都往埃及去，到约瑟那里籴粮，因为天下的饥荒甚大。神是如何一步一步把约瑟放在现在这个位置上的？

Think on your life. How have you been put in a position to serve God and help others?
回顾你的人生。你是如何被带领到现在的这个位置上来服事神帮助他人的？
