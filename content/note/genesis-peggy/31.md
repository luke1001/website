Genesis 45-46 创世纪45-46
Genesis 45 Joseph Reveals Himself to His Brothers
创世纪45 约瑟坦认自己
            At the end of chapter 44, we heard of Judah's love for his brother Benjamin - he offered to become the slave in is place. Joseph had unmistakable proof of the genuineness  of his brothers' repentance.
在第44章结束，我们看到了犹大对他弟兄便雅悯的爱，他愿意代替便雅悯为奴。约瑟确切地证实了他弟兄们悔改的真实性。

            (1) Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers. (2) And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it.  What kind of weeping did Joseph have? (3) Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence. Name some reasons why Joseph's brothers might be terrified. (4)Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! (5) And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. (6) For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping. What news does Joseph give his brothers? (7) But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. What was  important? How did Joseph comfort his brothers?
45:1约瑟在左右站着的人面前情不自禁，吩咐一声说，人都要离开我出去。约瑟和弟兄相认的时候并没有一人站在他面前。45:2他就放声大哭，埃及人和法老家中的人都听见了。约瑟是怎么哭泣的？45:3约瑟对他弟兄们说，我是约瑟。我的父亲还在吗？他弟兄不能回答，因为在他面前都惊惶。请列出几个约瑟弟兄们惊惶的原因。45:4约瑟又对他弟兄们说，请你们近前来。他们就近前来。他说，我是你们的兄弟约瑟，就是你们所卖到埃及的。45:5现在，不要因为把我卖到这里自忧自恨。这是神差我在你们以先来，为要保全生命。45:6现在这地的饥荒已经二年了，还有五年不能耕种，不能收成。约瑟对他的弟兄们说了什么？45:7神差我在你们以先来，为要给你们存留余种在世上，又要大施拯救，保全你们的生命。什么才是重要的？约瑟如何来安慰他的弟兄们？

(8) "So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. (9) Now hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay. (10) You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have. (11) I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. What news and invitation did Joseph tell his brothers to carry to their father, Jacob? Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.' If the brothers did not listen what would happen to them.
45:8这样看来，差我到这里来的不是你们，乃是神。他又使我如法老的父，作他全家的主，并埃及全地的宰相。45:9你们要赶紧上到我父亲那里。对他说，你儿子约瑟这样说，神使我作全埃及的主，请你下到我这里来，不要耽延。45:10你和你我儿子孙子，连牛群羊群，并一切所有的，都可以住在歌珊地，与我相近。45:11我要在那里奉养你。因为还有五年的饥荒，约瑟要他的弟兄带什么消息和邀请给他们的父亲雅各？免得你和你的眷属，并一切所有的，都败落了。如果他的弟兄们不听从约瑟的，那么将会有什么事发生在他们身上？

(12) "You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you. (13) Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly." Why does Joseph repeat himself? Was Joseph bragging about himself? Explain your answer.
            45:12况且你们的眼和我兄弟便雅悯的眼都看见是我亲口对你们说话。45:13你们也要将我在埃及一切的荣耀和你们所看见的事都告诉我父亲，又要赶紧地将我父亲搬到我这里来。约瑟为什么又重复了他所说的话？约瑟是在炫耀自己吗？请解释你的回答。

(14) Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping. (15) And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him. What were the brothers willing to do?
45:14于是约瑟伏在他兄弟便雅悯的颈项上哭，便雅悯也在他的颈项上哭。45:15他又与众弟兄亲嘴，抱着他们哭，随后他弟兄就和他说话。他弟兄们愿意做什么？       

(16) When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased. (17) Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan, (18) and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.' How does Pharaoh respond to the news of Joseph's reunion with his brothers?
45:16这风声传到法老的宫里，说，约瑟的弟兄们来了。法老和他的臣仆都很喜欢。45:17法老对约瑟说，你吩咐你的弟兄们说，你们要这样行，把驮子抬在牲口上，起身往迦南地去。45:18将你们的父亲和你们的眷属都搬到我这里来，我要把埃及地的美物赐给你们，你们也要吃这地肥美的出产。法老得知约瑟与他弟兄们团聚的消息后，他是怎么做的？   

(19) "You are also directed to tell them, 'Do this: Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come. (20) Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.' " What does Pharaoh repeat to Joseph? (21) So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey. (22) To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes. (23) And this is what he sent to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. (24) Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!" Why does Joseph instruct his brothers not to quarrel as they return to tell Jacob the news? What would they quarrel about?
45:19现在我吩咐你们要这样行，从埃及地带着车辆去，把你们的孩子和妻子，并你们的父亲都搬来。45:20你们眼中不要爱惜你们的家具，因为埃及全地的美物都是你们的。法老又再一次对约瑟说了什么？45:21以色列的儿子们就如此行。约瑟照着法老的吩咐给他们车辆和路上用的食物，45:22又给他们各人一套衣服，惟独给便雅悯三百银子，五套衣服。45:23送给他父亲公驴十匹，驮着埃及的美物，母驴十匹，驮着粮食与饼和菜，为他父亲路上用。45:24于是约瑟打发他弟兄们回去，又对他们说，你们不要在路上相争。约瑟为什么嘱咐他的弟兄们在回去的路上不要争吵？他们会为什么而争吵？   

(25) So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. (26) They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them. (27) But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. (28) And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die." How did Jacob react to the news that Joseph was alive and ruling in Egypt in vs. 26 and vs. 28?
45:25他们从埃及上去，来到迦南地，他们的父亲雅各那里，45:26告诉他说，约瑟还在，并且作埃及全地的宰相。雅各心里冰凉，因为不信他们。45:27他们便将约瑟对他们说的一切话都告诉了他。他们父亲雅各又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆，心就苏醒了。45:28以色列说，罢了。罢了。我的儿子约瑟还在，趁我未死以先，我要去见他一面。在第26和28节中，雅各听到约瑟还活着并治理埃及地的消息时，他有什么反应？
Agree or Disagree? Joseph's brothers had to be filled with joy as they traveled back to Canaan in order to tell their father what had happened. Explain
同意或不同意？约瑟的弟兄们要返回迦南地将所发生的一切告诉他们的父亲，在路上他们一定是满心欢喜。

Notes注释
Father to Pharaoh - Joseph became Pharaoh's confidential counselor and friend.
法老的父---约瑟成为法老的私人顾问和朋友

Genesis 46 Jacob Journeys to Egypt
创世纪46 雅各下埃及

            (1) So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. Who else has offered sacrifices at Beersheba?  (2) And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!"  "Here I am," he replied.
            46:1以色列带着一切所有的，起身来到别是巴，就献祭给他父亲以撒的神。谁也在别是巴献过祭？46:2夜间，神在异象中对以色列说，雅各。雅各。他说，我在这里。

(3) "I am God, the God of your father," he said. "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. (4) I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph's own hand will close your eyes." Name the six things God reassures Jacob with as he sets out for Egypt?
            46:3神说，我是神，就是你父亲的神。你下埃及去不要害怕，因为我必使你在那里成为大族。46:4我要和你同下埃及去，也必定带你上来。约瑟必给你送终（原文作将手按在你的眼睛上）。请列出神在雅各出发去埃及时再次对他应许保证的六件事。

(5) Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him. (6) They also took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt. (7) He took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters—all his offspring. How did Jacob demonstrate he believed God?
            46:5雅各就从别是巴起行。以色列的儿子们使他们的父亲雅各和他们的妻子，儿女都坐在法老为雅各送来的车上。46:6他们又带着迦南地所得的牲畜，货财来到埃及。雅各和他的一切子孙都一同来了，46:7雅各把他的儿子，孙子，女儿，孙女，并他的子子孙孙，一同带到埃及。雅各如何用行动来表明他对神的信心？
(8) These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt: Reuben the firstborn of Jacob. (9) The sons of Reuben:       Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.  
            (10) The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.

            (14) The sons of Zebulun:  Sered, Elon and Jahleel.
            (15) These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all.

            (18) These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah—sixteen in all.
            (19) The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. (20) In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
            (21) The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
            (22) These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob—fourteen in all.
            (23) The son of Dan: Hushim.
            (24) The sons of Naphtali: Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem.
            (25) These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel—seven in all.
            (26) All those who went to Egypt with Jacob—those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons' wives—numbered sixty-six persons. (27) With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob's family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all. How old was Benjamin at the time he traveled to Egypt? Explain the listing of Benjamin's ten sons.
        46:8来到埃及的以色列人名字记在下面。雅各和他的儿孙，雅各的长子是流便。46:9流便的儿子是哈诺，法路，希斯伦，迦米。
46:10西缅的儿子是耶母利，雅悯，阿辖，雅斤，琐辖，还有迦南女子所生的扫罗。
46:11利未的儿子是革顺，哥辖，米拉利。
46:12犹大的儿子是珥，俄南，示拉，法勒斯，谢拉。惟有珥与俄南死在迦南地。法勒斯的儿子是希斯伦，哈母勒。
46:13以萨迦的儿子是陀拉，普瓦，约伯，伸仑。

46:17亚设的儿子是音拿，亦施瓦，亦施韦，比利亚，还有他们的妹子西拉。比利亚的儿子是希别，玛结。

46:19雅各之妻拉结的儿子是约瑟和便雅悯。

(28) Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen, (29) Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time.  How would you describe the reunion between Joseph and Jacob?
        46:28雅各打发犹大先去见约瑟，请派人引路往歌珊去。于是他们来到歌珊地。46:29约瑟套车往歌珊去，迎接他父亲以色列，及至见了面，就伏在父亲的颈项上，哭了许久。你如何来描述约瑟与雅各的相见？

(30) Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive." Why was Israel ready to die?
            46:30以色列对约瑟说，我既得见你的面，知道你还在，就是死我也甘心。为什么以色列死也甘心？

(31) Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me. (32) The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.' (33) When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, 'What is your occupation?' (34) you should answer, 'Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.' Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians."  Agree or Disagree. Living as a shepherd in Egypt was a good livelihood. For Jacob's sons? Explain your answer.
46:31约瑟对他的弟兄和他父的全家说，我要上去告诉法老，对他说，我的弟兄和我父的全家从前在迦南地，现今都到我这里来了。46:32他们本是牧羊的人，以养牲畜为业。他们把羊群牛群和一切所有的都带来了。46:33等法老召你们的时候，问你们说，你们以何事为业。46:34你们要说，你的仆人，从幼年直到如今，都以养牲畜为业，连我们的祖宗也都以此为业。这样，你们可以住在歌珊地，因为凡牧羊的都被埃及人所厌恶。同意或不同意。对于雅各的儿子们来说，在埃及以畜牧为生是一个好生计。请解释你的回答。

Notes注释
Seventy in all - The numbering is made according to custom which listed the founders of families, even though some were not yet born. In addition to the twelve sons of Jacob, the grandsons and great-grandsons are listed who became the ancestors of independent families.
共有七十人---计数的方法是根据当时的习俗，只列出家族的创始人，尽管有些还没有出生。除了雅各的十二个儿子，还列出了以后建立独立家族的孙辈和重孙辈。

Shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians - Shepherds were considered low-caste. Joseph wanted his brothers to remain secluded and unmixed while living in a fertile section of Egypt.
凡牧羊的都被埃及人所厌恶---牧羊人被视为低层阶级。约瑟想要他的弟兄们与埃及人分开居住在埃及的一块富饶之地。
