Genesis 24 Isaac and Rebekah 创世纪24章 以撒和利百加

Genesis 24 Isaac and Rebekah
创世纪24章 以撒和利百加
(1) Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. (2) He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh. (3) I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, (4) but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac." What important responsibility did Abraham entrust to his chief servant, Eliezer? Why was it important to Abraham for Isaac to have a wife who shared his faith in God?
1 亚伯拉罕年纪老迈，向来在一切事上耶和华都赐福给他。 2 亚伯拉罕对管理他全业最老的仆人说，请你把手放在我大腿底下。 3 我要叫你指着耶和华天地的主起誓，不要为我儿子娶这迦南地中的女子为妻。 4 你要往我本地本族去，为我的儿子以撒娶一个妻子。亚伯拉罕把什么重要的责任托付给他的首仆以利以谢？为什么以撒的妻子是否同样相信神对亚伯拉罕这么重要？

(5) The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?"
(6) "Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said. (7) "The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'-he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. (8) If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there." Why did Abraham prohibit Isaac from going back to Mesopotamia, Abraham’s native land? (9) So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. What does the use of oaths indicate about the seriousness of this matter?
5 仆人对他说，倘若女子不肯跟我到这地方来，我必须将你的儿子带回你原出之地吗？
6 亚伯拉罕对他说，你要谨慎，不要带我的儿子回那里去。 7 耶和华天上的主曾带领我离开父家和本族的地，对我说话，向我起誓说，我要将这地赐给你的后裔。他必差遣使者在你面前，你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子。 8 倘若女子不肯跟你来，我使你起的誓就与你无干了，只是不可带我的儿子回那里去。 为什么亚伯拉罕禁止以撒返回他的家乡， 9 仆人就把手放在他主人亚伯拉罕的大腿底下，为这事向他起誓。起誓显明这件事的重要性的用意是什么？
(10) Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor. (11) He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. Why did Eliezer take 10 camels and gifts?
10 那仆人从他主人的骆驼里取了十匹骆驼，并带些他主人各样的财物，起身往米所波大米去，到了拿鹤的城。 11 天将晚，众女子出来打水的时候，他便叫骆驼跪在城外的水井那里。为什么以利以谢取了十匹骆驼和礼物？
(12) Then he prayed, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. (13) See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. (14) May it be that when I say to a girl, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'-let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master." What kind of girl was Eliezer looking for?
12 他说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神阿，求你施恩给我主人亚伯拉罕，使我今日遇见好机会。 13 我现今站在井旁，城内居民的女子们正出来打水。 14 我向哪一个女子说，请你拿下水瓶来，给我水喝，她若说，请喝，我也给你的骆驼喝，愿那女子就作你所预定给你仆人以撒的妻。这样，我便知道你施恩给我主人了。以利以谢要寻找一位什么样的女孩儿？
(15) Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. (16) The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
What do we learn about Rebekah?
15 话还没有说完，不料，利百加肩头上扛着水瓶出来。利百加是彼土利所生的。彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子。我们对利百加都知道些什么？
(17) The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar." 18) "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
(19) After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking." (20) So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. (21) Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful. How did God answer Eliezer’s prayer?
17 仆人跑上前去迎着她，说，求你将瓶里的水给我一点喝。 18 女子说，我主请喝，就急忙拿下瓶来，托在手上给他喝。 19 女子给他喝了，就说，我再为你的骆驼打水，叫骆驼也喝足。 20 她就急忙把瓶里的水倒在槽里，又跑到井旁打水，就为所有的骆驼打上水来。 21 那人定睛看她，一句话也不说，要晓得耶和华赐他通达的道路没有。上帝是如何回应以利以谢的祷告的？
(22) When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. (23) Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?" Why did Eliezer present her with gifts.
22 骆驼喝足了，那人就拿一个金环，重半舍客勒，两个金镯，重十舍客勒，给了那女子， 23 说，请告诉我，你是谁的女儿，你父亲家里有我们住宿的地方没有。为什么以利以谢送给她礼物？
(24) She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor." (25) And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night." Who is Eliezer going to meet at the house?
24 女子说，我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。 25 又说，我们家里足有粮草，也有住宿的地方。以利以谢将要去家里见谁？
(26) Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, (27) saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives." Whom does Eliezer praise?
26 那人就低头向耶和华下拜， 27 说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神是应当称颂的，因他不断地以慈爱诚实待我主人。至于我，耶和华在路上引领我，直走到我主人的兄弟家里。以利以谢向谁赞美感谢？
(28) The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things. (29) Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. (30) As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. (31) "Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels." How did Rebekah’s family respond to Rebakah’s report of the incident at the well?
28 女子跑回去，照着这些话告诉她母亲和她家里的人。 29 利百加有一个哥哥，名叫拉班，看见金环，又看见金镯在他妹子的手上，并听见他妹子利百加的话，说那人对我如此如此说。拉班就跑出来往井旁去，到那人跟前，见他仍站在骆驼旁边的井旁那里。 30 31 便对他说，你这蒙耶和华赐福的，请进来，为什么站在外边？我已经收拾了房屋，也为骆驼预备了地方。利百加的家人听她讲了发生在井旁的事后有什么反应？
(32) So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. (33) Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." Describe the hospitality Eliezer received. "Then tell us," Laban said.
32 那人就进了拉班的家。拉班卸了骆驼，用草料喂上，拿水给那人和跟随的人洗脚， 33 把饭摆在他面前，叫他吃，他却说，我不吃，等我说明白我的事情再吃。请描述以利以谢所受到的款待。拉班说，请说。
(34) So he said, "I am Abraham's servant. (35) The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys. (36) My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. (37) And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, (38) but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'
(39) "Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?' (40) "He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family. (41) Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you—you will be released from my oath.'
(42) "When I came to the spring today, I said, 'O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. (43) See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar," (44) and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.'
(45) "Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
(46) "She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
(47) "I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' "She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, (48) and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son. (49) Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn." What important things did Eliezer stress as he explained his mission and God’s leading to Rebekah’s family?
34 他说，我是亚伯拉罕的仆人。 35 耶和华大大地赐福给我主人，使他昌大，又赐给他羊群，牛群，金银，仆婢，骆驼，和驴。 36 我主人的妻子撒拉年老的时候给我主人生了一个儿子。我主人也将一切所有的都给了这个儿子。 37 我主人叫我起誓说，你不要为我儿子娶迦南地的女子为妻。 38 你要往我父家，我本族那里去，为我的儿子娶一个妻子。 39 我对我主人说，恐怕女子不肯跟我来。 40 他就说，我所事奉的耶和华必要差遣他的使者与你同去，叫你的道路通达，你就得以在我父家，我本族那里，给我的儿子娶一个妻子。 41 只要你到了我本族那里，我使你起的誓就与你无干。他们若不把女子交给你，我使你起的誓也与你无干。 42 我今日到了井旁，便说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神阿，愿你叫我所行的道路通达。 43 我如今站在井旁，对那一个出来打水的女子说，请你把你瓶里的水给我一点喝。 44 她若说，你只管喝，我也为你的骆驼打水。愿那女子就作耶和华给我主人儿子所预定的妻。 45 我心里的话还没有说完，利百加就出来，肩头上扛着水瓶，下到井旁打水。我便对她说，请你给我水喝。 46 她就急忙从肩头上拿下瓶来，说，请喝，我也给你的骆驼喝。我便喝了。她又给我的骆驼喝了。 47 我问她说，你是谁的女儿，她说，我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。我就把环子戴在她鼻子上，把镯子戴在她两手上。 48 随后我低头向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神。因为他引导我走合式的道路，使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女，给我主人的儿子为妻。 49 现在你们若愿以慈爱诚实待我主人，就告诉我。若不然，也告诉我，使我可以或向左，或向右。以利以谢在讲述他的使命和上帝引领他到利百加的家时，强调了什么重要的事？
(50) Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. (51) Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed." How did Rebekah’s family react to the request Abraham’s servant made?
50 拉班和彼土利回答说，这事乃出于耶和华，我们不能向你说好说歹。 51 看哪，利百加在你面前，可以将她带去，照着耶和华所说的，给你主人的儿子为妻。利百加的家人是如何对待亚伯拉罕仆人的请求的？
(52) When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. (53) Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. (54) Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."
(55) But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go."
(56) But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master."
(57) Then they said, "Let's call the girl and ask her about it." (58) So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" "I will go," she said. How was it decided when Rebekah should depart for Canaan?
(59) So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men. (60) And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,
"Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies." What important gifts did Rebekah’s family give her as she left them for her new life in Canaan?
52 亚伯拉罕的仆人听见他们这话，就向耶和华俯伏在地。 53 当下仆人拿出金器，银器，和衣服送给利百加，又将宝物送给她哥哥和她母亲。 54 仆人和跟从他的人吃了喝了，住了一夜。早晨起来，仆人就说，请打发我回我主人那里去吧。 55 利百加的哥哥和她母亲说，让女子同我们再住几天，至少十天，然后她可以去。 56 仆人说，耶和华既赐给我通达的道路，你们不要耽误我，请打发我走，回我主人那里去吧。 57 他们说，我们把女子叫来问问她。 58 就叫了利百加来，问她说，你和这人同去吗？利百加说，我去。 利百加去迦南地的时间是怎样决定的？ 59 于是他们打发妹子利百加和她的乳母，同亚伯拉罕的仆人，并跟从仆人的，都走了。 60 他们就给利百加祝福说，我们的妹子阿，愿你作千万人的母。愿你的后裔得着仇敌的城门。当利百加要离开他们去迦南地开始新的生活时，利百加的家人送给她什么样的重要礼物？

(61) Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
(62) Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. (63) He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. (64) Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel (65) and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
(66) Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. (67) Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. How did Isaac respond to the woman Eliezer had brought him?
61 利百加和她的使女们起来，骑上骆驼，跟着那仆人，仆人就带着利百加走了。 62 那时，以撒住在南地，刚从庇耳拉海莱回来。 63 天将晚，以撒出来在田间默想，举目一看，见来了些骆驼。 64 利百加举目看见以撒，就急忙下了骆驼， 65 问那仆人说，这田间走来迎接我们的是谁。仆人说，是我的主人。利百加就拿帕子蒙上脸。 66 仆人就将所办的一切事都告诉以撒。 67 以撒便领利百加进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚，娶了她为妻，并且爱她。以撒自从他母亲不在了，这才得了安慰。以撒是怎样对待以利以谢为他带回来的女人的？
