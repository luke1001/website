Genesis 26 Isaac and Abimelech 创世纪26 以撒与亚比米勒
Genesis 26 Isaac and Abimelech
创世纪26 以撒与亚比米勒
Verses 1 – 33 take place before the birth of Esau and Jacob (chapter 25).
第1到33节讲述在以扫和雅各出生之前的事（25章）

(1) Now there was a famine in the land—besides the earlier famine of Abraham's time—and Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar. (2) The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. (3) Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. What direction did God give Isaac when a famine occurred? For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. What did God promise Isaac? (4) I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, (5) because Abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees and my laws." What did God promise to Isaac that he had promised Abraham? (6) So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
1在亚伯拉罕的日子，那地有一次饥荒。这时又有饥荒，以撒就往基拉耳去，到非利士人的王亚比米勒那里。2耶和华向以撒显现，说，你不要下埃及去，要住在我所指示你的地。3你寄居在这地，我必与你同在，赐福给你，当饥荒发生的时候上帝给以撒什么指示？因为我要将这些地都赐给你和你的后裔。我必坚定我向你父亚伯拉罕所起的誓。上帝应许以撒什么？4我要加增你的后裔，像天上的星那样多，又要将这些地都赐给你的后裔。并且地上万国必因你的后裔得福5都因亚伯拉罕听从我的话，遵守我的吩咐和我的命令，律例，法度。上帝对以撒的应许有哪些是曾向亚伯拉罕应许过的？6以撒就住在基拉耳。
(7) When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful." What mistake/sin did Isaac commit, similar to that of Abraham?
7那地方的人问到他的妻子，他便说，那是我的妹子。原来他怕说，是我的妻子。他心里想，恐怕这地方的人为利百加的缘故杀我，因为她容貌俊美。以撒做了什么错事/罪，是亚伯拉罕也同样做过的？
(8) When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. (9) So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her." What weakness did Isaac show?
8他在那里住了许久。有一天，非利士人的王亚比米勒从窗户里往外观看，见以撒和他的妻子利百加戏玩。9 亚比米勒召了以撒来，对他说，她实在是你的妻子，你怎么说她是你的妹子。以撒说，我心里想，恐怕我因她而死。这显示出以撒有什么样的软弱？
(10) Then Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us." What does Abimelech realize?
10亚比米勒说，你向我们作的是什么事呢？民中险些有人和你的妻同寝，把我们陷在罪里。亚比米勒意识到会发生什么事？
(11) So Abimelech gave orders to all the people: "Anyone who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
11于是亚比米勒晓谕众民说，凡沾着这个人，或是他妻子的，定要把他治死。
(12) Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him. (13) The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. (14) He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. How did the Lord show favor to Isaac? (15) So all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. What did the Philistines do?
12以撒在那地耕种，那一年有百倍的收成。耶和华赐福给他，13他就昌大，日增月盛，成了大富户。14他有羊群牛群，又有许多仆人，非利士人就嫉妒他。上帝是怎样眷顾以撒的？15当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世的日子，他父亲的仆人所挖的井，非利士人全都塞住，填满了土。非利士人做了什么？
(16) Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us." Of what was Abimelech afraid?
(17) So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there. (18) Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. Do you think Isaac was familiar with the land? Why?
16亚比米勒对以撒说，你离开我们去吧。因为你比我们强盛得多。亚比米勒惧怕什么？
17以撒就离开那里，在基拉耳谷支搭帐棚，住在那里。18当他父亲亚伯拉罕在世之日所挖的水井因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了，以撒就重新挖出来，仍照他父亲所叫的叫那些井的名字。你认为以撒熟悉那地吗？为什么？

(19) Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. (20) But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him. (21) Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. (22) He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land." What noble qualities did Isaac show as he handled the disputes over water rights and the ownership of wells?
19以撒的仆人在谷中挖井，便得了一口活水井。20基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞，说，这水是我们的。以撒就给那井起名叫埃色，因为他们和他相争（埃色就是相争的意思）。21以撒的仆人又挖了一口井，他们又为这井争竞，因此以撒给这井起名叫西提拿（西提拿就是为敌的意思）。22以撒离开那里，又挖了一口井，他们不为这井争竞了，他就给那井起名叫利河伯（就是宽阔的意思）。他说，耶和华现在给我们宽阔之地，我们必在这地昌盛。以撒在处理用水及水井的权利争端之事上显出了什么样的高尚品德？
(23) From there he went up to Beersheba. (24) That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham." What encouraging message did God bring to Isaac as he moved to Beersheba?
23以撒从那里上别是巴去。24当夜耶和华向他显现，说，我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕，因为我与你同在，要赐福给你，并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故，使你的后裔繁多。当以撒要迁徙到别是巴的时候，上帝给了他什么样的鼓舞信息？
(25) Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. How did Isaac demonstrate that he believed God’s message?
25以撒就在那里筑了一座坛，求告耶和华的名，并且支搭帐棚。他的仆人便在那里挖了一口井。以撒是怎样显明自己相信上帝的信息？
(26) Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. (27) Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?"
26亚比米勒，同他的朋友亚户撒和他的军长非各，从基拉耳来见以撒。27以撒对他们说，你们既然恨我，打发我走了，为什么到我这里来呢？
(28) They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us'-between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you (29) that you will do us no harm, just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD." What did King Abimelech conclude about Isaac?
28他们说，我们明明地看见耶和华与你同在，便说，不如我们两下彼此起誓，彼此立约，29使你不害我们，正如我们未曾害你，一味地厚待你，并且打发你平平安安地走。你是蒙耶和华赐福的了。亚比米勒王对以撒得出什么样的结论？

(30) Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. (31) Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace. What was Abimelech’s and Isaacs’s relation now?
30以撒就为他们设摆筵席，他们便吃了喝了。31他们清早起来彼此起誓。以撒打发他们走，他们就平平安安地离开他走了。亚比米勒和以撒现在是什么样的关系？
(32) That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, "We've found water!" (33) He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba. What good news did Isaac receive?
32那一天，以撒的仆人来，将挖井的事告诉他说，我们得了水了。33他就给那井起名叫示巴。因此那城叫作别是巴，直到今日。以撒得到了什么好消息？
(34) When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. (35) They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah. Why was Esau’s marriage a source of problem to Isaac and Rebekah?
34以扫四十岁的时候娶了赫人比利的女儿犹滴，与赫人以伦的女儿巴实抹为妻。35她们常使以撒和利百加心里愁烦。为什么以扫的婚姻常使以扫和利百加愁烦？
