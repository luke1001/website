Genesis 11 The Tower of Babel 创世纪11 巴别塔
Genesis 11 The Tower of Babel
创世纪11 巴别塔

(1) Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. (2) As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. Where did the people of the world migrate and decide to settle after the flood? (3) They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. What did their choice of building materials indicate about the project? (4) Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth." What attitudes about themselves and God did they express as they undertook this building project? What did the people hope to accomplish with a tower?
11:1 那 时 ， 天 下 人 的 口 音 ， 言 语 ， 都 是 一 样 。 11:2 他 们 往 东 边 迁 移 的 时 候 ， 在 示 拿 地 遇 见 一 片 平 原 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。大洪水之后天下人向哪里迁移并决定在什么地方住下？ 11:3 他 们 彼 此 商 量 说 ， 来 吧 ， 我 们 要 作 砖 ， 把 砖 烧 透 了 。 他 们 就 拿 砖 当 石 头 ， 又 拿 石 漆 当 灰 泥 。 他们对建筑材料的选择说明了他们所要做的这项工程是什么样的？ 11:4 他 们 说 ， 来 吧 ， 我 们 要 建 造 一 座 城 和 一 座 塔 ， 塔 顶 通 天 ， 为 要 传 扬 我 们 的 名 ， 免 得 我 们 分 散 在 全 地 上 。当他们开始这个建筑工程时，对自己和神是怎样的态度？那时的人对建成这塔后的期望是什么？
(5) But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. How did the Lord respond? (6) The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. If the people succeeded in defying God and building this tower, what else could follow? (7) Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other." What conclusion did God reach after His review of the building project? Why was the confusion of human language a good choice for God?
11:5耶和华降临，要看看世人所建造的城和塔。上帝是如何回应这件事的？6耶和华说：“看哪！他们成为一样的人民，都是一样的言语，如今既作起这事来，以后他们所要作的事，就没有不成就的了。如果人类成功的公然藐视神建成这塔，那接下来会怎样？7我们下去，在那里变乱他们的口音，使他们的言语彼此不通。”上帝观看了这个建造的工程后，祂的结论如何？为什么变乱人的口音对神来说是一个好的抉择？
(8) So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. What happened as a result of God confusing the languages? (9) That is why it was called Babel—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
创 11:8于是，耶和华使他们从那里分散在全地上；他们就停工不造那城了。上帝变乱语言后发生了什么？9因为耶和华在那里变乱天下人的言语，使众人分散在全地上，所以那城名叫巴别。

From Shem to Abram
从闪到亚伯兰
(10) This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad. (11) And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
(12) When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah. (13) And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
(14) When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber. (15) And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
(16) When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg. (17) And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
(18) When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu. (19) And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
(20) When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug. (21) And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
(22) When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor. (23) And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
(24) When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah. (25) And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
(26) After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
(27)This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot. (28) While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth. (29) Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah. What do you notice about the marriage between relatives? (30) Now Sarai was barren; she had no children. How was a woman looked on who had n o children?
(31) Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
(32) Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
