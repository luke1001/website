Genesis 47-48 创世纪47-48
Genesis 47 Joseph Settles His Family
创世纪47 约瑟安顿他的家人

            (1) Joseph went and told Pharaoh, "My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen." (2) He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
            47:1约瑟进去告诉法老说，我的父亲和我的弟兄带着羊群牛群，并一切所有的，从迦南地来了，如今在歌珊地。47:2约瑟从他弟兄中挑出五个人来，引他们去见法老。
(3) Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is your occupation?" "Your servants are shepherds," they replied to Pharaoh, "just as our fathers were." (4) They also said to him, "We have come to live here awhile, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants' flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen."   What had Joseph foreseen?
47:3法老问约瑟的弟兄说，你们以何事为业，他们对法老说，你仆人是牧羊的，连我们的祖宗也是牧羊的。47:4他们又对法老说，迦南地的饥荒甚大，仆人的羊群没有草吃，所以我们来到这地寄居。现在求你容仆人住在歌珊地。约瑟预见到了什么？
            (5) Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you, (6) and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. What decision did Pharaoh grant to Joseph? And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock."
            47:5法老对约瑟说，你父亲和你弟兄到你这里来了，47:6埃及地都在你面前，只管叫你父亲和你弟兄住在国中最好的地。他们可以住在歌珊地。法老赐给约瑟什么旨意？你若知道他们中间有什么能人，就派他们看管我的牲畜。
(7) Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh, (8) Pharaoh asked him, "How old are you?"  What did Jacob give Pharaoh?
47:7约瑟领他父亲雅各进到法老面前，雅各就给法老祝福。47:8法老问雅各说，你平生的年日是多少呢？雅各给了法老什么？
            (9) And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers." How old is Jacob at this time? (10) Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.  How did Jacob describe his life? At this point in your life's journey, how would you describe the years you have lived?
47:9雅各对法老说，我寄居在世的年日是一百三十岁，我平生的年日又少又苦，不及我列祖早在世寄居的年日。雅各当时多大？47:10雅各又给法老祝福，就从法老面前出去了。雅各如何描述自己的日子？此时在你生命的路程中，你会如何来描述你所度过的年日？
            (11) So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed. (12) Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their children. What did Joseph provide his family with during this time of shortages?
47:11约瑟遵着法老的命，把埃及国最好的地，就是兰塞境内的地，给他父亲和弟兄居住，作为产业。47:12约瑟用粮食奉养他父亲和他弟兄，并他父亲全家的眷属，都是照各家的人口奉养他们。在物资短缺的时候约瑟是用什么来供养他的家人的？

Joseph and the Famine约瑟和饥荒
            (13) There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine. (14) Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace. (15) When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is used up."
47:13饥荒甚大，全地都绝了粮，甚至埃及地和迦南地的人因那饥荒的缘故都饿昏了。47:14约瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的银子，就是众人籴粮的银子，约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里。47:15埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了，埃及众人都来见约瑟，说，我们的银子都用尽了，求你给我们粮食，我们为什么死在你面前呢？
            (16) "Then bring your livestock," said Joseph. "I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone." (17) So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.
47:16约瑟说，若是银子用尽了，可以把你们的牲畜给我，我就为你们的牲畜给你们粮食。47:17于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里，约瑟就拿粮食换了他们的牛，羊，驴，马。那一年因换他们一切的牲畜，就用粮食养活他们。
            (18) When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, "We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. (19) Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."
47:18那一年过去，第二年他们又来见约瑟，说，我们不瞒我主，我们的银子都花尽了，牲畜也都归了我主。我们在我主眼前，除了我们的身体和田地之外，一无所剩。47:19你何忍见我们人死地荒呢？求你用粮食买我们和我们的地，我们和我们的地就要给法老效力。又求你给我们种子，使我们得以存活，不至死亡，地土也不至荒凉。
            (20) So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's, (21) and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, [c] from one end of Egypt to the other. (22) However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
47:20于是，约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的地，埃及人因被饥荒所迫，各都卖了自己的田地。那地就都归了法老。47:21至于百姓，约瑟叫他们，从埃及这边直到埃及那边，都各归各城。47:22惟有祭司的地，约瑟没有买，因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸。他们吃法老所给的常俸，所以他们不卖自己的地。
            (23) Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground. (24) But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children."
47:23约瑟对百姓说，我今日为法老买了你们和你们的地，看哪，这里有种子给你们，你们可以种地。47:24后来打粮食的时候，你们要把五分之一纳给法老，四分可以归你们作地里的种子，也作你们和你们家口孩童的食物。
As the years of the famine continued, what agreements did Joseph reach with the people of Egypt so they would receive food to live:
            vs. 14-15?

            vs. 16-17?

            vs. 18-21?

            vs. 23-24?
在随后几个饥荒年里，约瑟同埃及人达成了什么协议可使他们得粮而活：
14-15节？
16-17节？
18-21节？
23-24节？
            (25) "You have saved our lives," they said. "May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh." What was the people's reaction to everything they once owned belonging to Pharaoh? (26) So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh's. What are your thoughts regarding Joseph's tax policy for the nation of Egypt?
47:25他们说，你救了我们的性命。但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩，我们就作法老的仆人。对于他们曾拥有的一切现在却都归于法老，埃及人有什么反应？47:26于是约瑟为埃及地定下常例，直到今日，法老必得五分之一，惟独祭司的地不归法老。对于约瑟对埃及人的税收制度，你有什么想法？
            (27) Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number. How did Jacob's family do during the famine? (28) Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven. How old is Jacob at this time? (29) When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, (30) but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried."  "I will do as you say," he said. What promise did Joseph make to Jacob?
47:27以色列人住在埃及的歌珊地。他们在那里置了产业，并且生育甚多。雅各的家人在饥荒中过得怎么样？47:28雅各住在埃及地十七年，雅各平生的年日是一百四十七岁。雅各此时多大？47:29以色列的死期临近了，他就叫了他儿子约瑟来，说，我若在你眼前蒙恩，请你把手放在我大腿底下，用慈爱和诚实待我，请你不要将我葬在埃及。47:30我与我祖我父同睡的时候，你要将我带出埃及，葬在他们所葬的地方。约瑟说，我必遵着你的命而行。约瑟向雅各许了什么愿？
            (31) "Swear to me," he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. Why did Jacob worship God?
47:31雅各说，你要向我起誓。约瑟就向他起了誓，于是以色列在床头上（或作扶着杖头）敬拜神。约瑟为什么要敬拜神？

Joseph went and told Pharaoh -  This was the formal and official notification of their arrival .
约瑟进去告诉法老—这是对于他们到来的正式官方通知。

Genesis 48 Jacob Recognizes Ephraim and Manasseh as Sons and Heirs
创世纪48雅各认玛拿西和以法莲为后裔

            (1) Some time later Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. (2) When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
            (3)Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me (4) and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.'  What promise does Jacob remember?
48:1这事以后，有人告诉约瑟说，你的父亲病了。他就带着两个儿子玛拿西和以法莲同去。48:2有人告诉雅各说，请看，你儿子约瑟到你这里来了。以色列就勉强在床上坐起来。
48:3雅各对约瑟说，全能的神曾在迦南地的路斯向我显现，赐福与我，48:4对我说，我必使你生养众多，成为多民，又要把这地赐给你的后裔，永远为业。雅各记起神对他的什么应许？
            (5) "Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. (6) Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. What pledge does Jacob make concerning Joseph's two sons? (7) As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem).
48:5我未到埃及见你之先，你在埃及地所生的以法莲和玛拿西这两个儿子是我的，正如流便和西缅是我的一样。48:6你在他们以后所生的就是你的，他们可以归于他们弟兄的名下得产业。对于约瑟的两个儿子雅各作出了什么请求？48:7至于我，我从巴旦来的时候，拉结死在我眼前，在迦南地的路上，离以法他还有一段路程，我就把她葬在以法他的路上。以法他就是伯利恒。
            (8) When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, "Who are these?" What had Jacob not noticed until this time?
48:8以色列看见约瑟的两个儿子，就说，这是谁？直到此时雅各还没有注意到什么？
            (9) "They are the sons God has given me here," Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them."
            (10) Now Israel's eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. (11) Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too." Why was it a pleasure for Jacob to personally meet his grandsons from Joseph?
48:9约瑟对他父亲说，这是神在这里赐给我的儿子。以色列说，请你领他们到我跟前，我要给他们祝福。
48:10以色列年纪老迈，眼睛昏花，不能看见。约瑟领他们到他跟前，他就和他们亲嘴，抱着他们。48:11以色列对约瑟说，我想不到得见你的面，不料，神又使我得见你的儿子。能亲自见到他从约瑟得的孙子，这为什么对雅各来说是一件非常高兴的事？
            (12) Then Joseph removed them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. (13) And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him. (14) But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. What type of blessing was Ephraim to receive?
48:12约瑟把两个儿子从以色列两膝中领出来，自己就脸伏于地下拜。48:13随后，约瑟又拉着他们两个，以法莲在他的右手里，对着以色列的左手，玛拿西在他的左手里，对着以色列的右手，领他们到以色列的跟前。48:14以色列伸出右手来，按在以法莲的头上，以法莲乃是次子。又剪搭过左手来，按在玛拿西的头上，玛拿西原是长子。以法莲得到了什么样的祝福？
            (15) Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my father's Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day, (16) the Angel who has delivered me from all harm—may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my father's Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly upon the earth."
            (17) When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim's head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. (18) Joseph said to him, "No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head." What does Joseph try to change?
48:15他就给约瑟祝福说，愿我祖亚伯拉罕和我父以撒所事奉的神，就是一生牧养我直到今日的神，48:16救赎我脱离一切患难的那使者，赐福与这两个童子。愿他们归在我的名下和我祖亚伯拉罕，我父以撒的名下。又愿他们在世界中生养众多。
48:17约瑟见他父亲把右手按在以法莲的头上，就不喜悦，便提起他父亲的手，要从以法莲的头上挪到玛拿西的头上。48:18约瑟对他父亲说，我父，不是这样。这本是长子，求你把右手按在他的头上。约瑟要纠正什么？
            (19) But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations." (20) He blessed them that day and said, "In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing: 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.' "  So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. What do we learn about the later tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh?
48:19他父亲不从，说，我知道，我儿，我知道。他也必成为一族，也必昌大。只是他的兄弟将来比他还大。他兄弟的后裔要成为多族。48:20当日就给他们祝福说，以色列人要指着你们祝福说，愿神使你如以法莲，玛拿西一样。于是立以法莲在玛拿西以上。从这里我们知道以法莲和玛拿西的族裔以后是什么境况？
            (21) Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers. (22) And to you, as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow." What significant gift did Jacob give his son, Joseph, as acknowledgment for his leadership for the welfare of the family?
48:21以色列又对约瑟说，我要死了，但神必与你们同在，领你们回到你们列祖之地。48:22并且我从前用弓用刀从亚摩利人手下夺的那块地，我都赐给你，使你比众弟兄多得一分。雅各赐给他的儿子约瑟什么重要礼物以确认约瑟对这个家族的领导权？
