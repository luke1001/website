Genesis 38 Judah and Tamar 创世纪38 犹大与他玛

Genesis 38 Judah and Tamar
创世纪38 犹大与他玛
            Judah is the fourth son of Jacob. The Savior, Jesus, will come from his line. Judah suggested that Joseph be sold rather than put to death.
            Judah left his family and settled near the town of Abdullamite. The sad events of this chapter show the danger that Jacob's (Israel) children were in by living among the Canaanites.
犹大是雅各的第四个儿子。救主耶稣就是出于犹大支派。犹大建议不要把约瑟杀死而是将他卖掉。
犹大离开他的本家，在亚杜兰城附近住下。这章所记载的悲剧展现了雅各的孩子们因与迦南人混居而被置于的危险境地。

(1) At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. (2) There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her; (3) she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. (4) She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. (5) She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. Who did Judah marry? How many sons did Judah and Shua have? Who named the first born? Who named the other children?
38:1那时，犹大离开他弟兄下去，到一个亚杜兰人名叫希拉的家里去。38:2犹大在那里看见一个迦南人名叫书亚的女儿，就娶她为妻，与她同房，38:3她就怀孕生了儿子，犹大给他起名叫珥。38:4她又怀孕生了儿子，母亲给他起名叫俄南。38:5她复又生了儿子，给他起名叫示拉。她生示拉的时候，犹大正在基悉。犹大娶了谁？犹大和书亚的女儿共有几个儿子？谁为第一个儿子命名？谁为其他的儿子命名？
(6) Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. (7) But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death. What happened to Er? (8) Then Judah said to Onan, "Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother." What was the duty of Onan? (9) But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother. Why didn't Onan want to fulfill his responsibility? (10) What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also. What happened to Onan?
            38:6犹大为长子珥娶妻，名叫他玛。38:7犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华就叫他死了。珥出了什么事？38:8犹大对俄南说，你当与你哥哥的妻子同房，向她尽你为弟的本分，为你哥哥生子立后。俄南有什么责任？38:9俄南知道生子不归自己，所以同房的时候便遗在地，免得给他哥哥留后。俄南为什么不愿尽他的责任？38:10俄南所作的在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华也就叫他死了。俄南出了什么事？
(11) Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." What do we learn about the age of Shelah? For he thought, "He may die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.  It was the custom for widows to live with the in-laws if there was no one to care for them.
38:11犹大心里说，恐怕示拉也死，像他两个哥哥一样，就对他儿妇他玛说，你去，在你父亲家里守寡，等我儿子示拉长大。关于示拉的年龄我们知道什么？他玛就回去，住在她父亲家里。如果寡妇无人照管，她们就要与公婆同住。这是当时的习俗。
(12) After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. What happened to Judah's wife? When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. Where was Judah going?
38:12过了许久，犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了。犹大的妻子出了什么事？犹大得了安慰，就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉上亭拿去，到他剪羊毛的人那里。犹大去了哪里？
(13) When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep," (14) she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. What had not taken place between Tamar and Shelah? What was Tamar pretending to be? Why?
38:13有人告诉他玛说，你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了。38:14他玛见示拉已经长大，还没有娶她为妻，就脱了她作寡妇的衣裳，用帕子蒙着脸，又遮住身体，坐在亭拿路上的伊拿印城门口。他玛和示拉之间还没发生什么事情？他玛要装作什么？为什么？
(15) When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. (16) Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you."  "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked. (17) "I'll send you a young goat from my flock," he said. What had Judah promised her? "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?" she asked. What did Tamar want?
38:15犹大看见她，以为是妓女，因为她蒙着脸。38:16犹大就转到她那里去，说，来吧。让我与你同寝。他原不知道是他的儿妇。他玛说，你要与我同寝，把什么给我呢？38:17犹大说，我从羊群里取一只山羊羔，打发人送来给你。犹大答应要给她什么？他玛说，在未送以先，你愿意给我一个当头吗？他玛想要什么？
(18) He said, "What pledge should I give you?" "Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand," she answered. Why would Tamar ask for Judah's seal and its cord and his staff? So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. (19) After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again. Where did Tamar return?
38:18他说，我给你什么当头呢？他玛说，你的印，你的带子，和你手里的杖。他玛为什么要犹大的印，带子和杖？犹大就给了她，与她同寝，她就从犹大怀了孕。38:19他玛起来走了，除去帕子，仍旧穿上作寡妇的衣裳。他玛回到哪里去了？
(20) Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.  What happened when Judah wanted to get his pledge back? (21) He asked the men who lived there, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" "There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here," they said. Had Tamar been noticed?
38:20犹大托他朋友亚杜兰人送一只山羊羔去，要从那女人手里取回当头来，却找不着她。但犹大想要拿回他的当头时发生了什么事？38:21就问那地方的人说，伊拿印路旁的妓女在哪里，他们说，这里并没有妓女。他玛有没有被发现？
(22) So he went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.' "
(23) Then Judah said, "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. What was Judah afraid to search anymore? After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her." (24) About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." What do we learn about Tamar?Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!" What did Judah announce as her punishment?
38:22他回去见犹大说，我没有找着她，并且那地方的人说，这里没有妓女。
38:23犹大说，我把这山羊羔送去了，你竟找不着她。任凭她拿去吧，免得我们被羞辱。犹大怕什么？38:24约过了三个月，有人告诉犹大说，你的儿妇他玛作了妓女，且因行淫有了身孕。我们了解到他玛发生了什么事？犹大说，拉出她来，把她烧了。犹大要怎样惩罚他玛？
(25) As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are." (26) Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." What did Judah acknowledge? Why? And he did not sleep with her again.
38:25他玛被拉出来的时候便打发人去见她公公，对他说，这些东西是谁的，我就是从谁怀的孕。请你认一认，这印和带子并杖都是谁的，38:26犹大承认说，她比我更有义，因为我没有将她给我的儿子示拉。犹大承认了什么？为什么？从此犹大不再与她同寝了。
(27) When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. (28) As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, "This one came out first." (29) But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "So this is how you have broken out!" And he was named Perez. (30) Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.  What does God tell us about Himself by including people like Judah, Tamar and Peres as ancestors of Jesus?
38:27他玛将要生产，不料她腹里是一对双生。38:28到生产的时候，一个孩子伸出一只手来。收生婆拿红线拴在他手上，说，这是头生的。38:29随后这孩子把手收回去，他哥哥生出来了。收生婆说，你为什么抢着来呢？因此给他起名叫法勒斯。38:30后来，他兄弟那手上有红线的也生出来，就给他起名叫谢拉。神安排像犹大，他玛和法勒斯这样的人作耶稣的祖先，祂这是要告诉我们什么呢？

Genesis 39 Joseph and Potiphar's Wife
创世纪39 约瑟与波提乏的妻子

(1) Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. What happened to Joseph after he was brought to Egypt?
39:1约瑟被带下埃及去。有一个埃及人，是法老的内臣，护卫长波提乏，从那些带下他来的以实玛利人手下买了他去。约瑟被带到埃及后，他发生了什么事？
(2) The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master. How would you describe Joseph life in Egypt? (3) When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did, (4) Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. (5) From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field. Describe the Lord's blessing on Joseph. (6) So he left in Joseph's care everything he had; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. How much trust and responsibility did Joseph receive from his master?
39:2约瑟住在他主人埃及人的家中，耶和华与他同在，他就百事顺利。你如何来描述约瑟在埃及的生活？39:3他主人见耶和华与他同在，又见耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利，39:4约瑟就在主人眼前蒙恩，伺候他主人，并且主人派他管理家务，把一切所有的都交在他手里。39:5自从主人派约瑟管理家务和他一切所有的，耶和华就因约瑟的缘故赐福与那埃及人的家。凡家里和田间一切所有的都蒙耶和华赐福。请描述一下耶和华对约瑟的祝福。39:6波提乏将一切所有的都交在约瑟的手中，除了自己所吃的饭，别的事一概不知。约瑟从他主人那里得到了多少信任与责任？
Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, (7) and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed with me!" What temptation was Joseph faced with? (8) But he refused. "With me in charge," he told her, "my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care. (9) No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?" What reasons does Joseph give for not giving into Potiphar's wife?(10) And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. What did Joseph continue to refuse?
约瑟原来秀雅俊美。39:7这事以后，约瑟主人的妻以目送情给约瑟，说，你与我同寝吧。约瑟面临着什么样的试探？39:8约瑟不从，对他主人的妻说，看哪，一切家务，我主人都不知道。他把所有的都交在我手里。39:9在这家里没有比我大的。并且他没有留下一样不交给我，只留下了你，因为你是他的妻子。我怎能作这大恶，得罪神呢？约瑟给出了什么理由来解释他对波提乏妻子的不从？39:10后来她天天和约瑟说，约瑟却不听从她，不与她同寝，也不和她在一处。约瑟一直拒绝什么？

(11) One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. (12) She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. How did Joseph show his faithfulness to God  and to his master?
39:11有一天，约瑟进屋里去办事，家中人没有一个在那屋里，39:12妇人就拉住他的衣裳，说，你与我同寝吧。约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里，跑到外边去了。约瑟是如何表现出他对神和他主人的忠诚的？

(13) When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, (14) she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed. (15) When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house." What lie did Potiphar's wife tell?
39:13妇人看见约瑟把衣裳丢在她手里跑出去了，39:14就叫了家里的人来，对他们说，你们看。他带了一个希伯来人进入我们家里，要戏弄我们。他到我这里来，要与我同寝，我就大声喊叫。39:15他听见我放声喊起来，就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑到外边去了。波提乏的妻子说了什么谎话？

(16) She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. (17) Then she told him this story: "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me. (18) But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house." What did Potiphar's wife do to punish Joseph for resisting her repeated advances?
39:16妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里，等着他主人回家，39:17就对他如此如此说，你所带到我们这里的那希伯来仆人进来要戏弄我，39:18我放声喊起来，他就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑出去了。对于约瑟持续拒绝她的要求，波提乏的妻子是怎样惩罚约瑟的？

(19) When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he burned with anger. (20) Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. How did Potiphar respond to the accusations his wife brought against Joseph?
            39:19约瑟的主人听见他妻子对他所说的话，说，你的仆人如此如此待我，他就生气，39:20把约瑟下在监里，就是王的囚犯被囚的地方。波提乏是如何回应他妻子对约瑟的指控的？

But while Joseph was there in the prison, (21) the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. What happened while Joseph was in prison? (22) So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. (23) The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did. Although Joseph was a prisoner, what responsibility was Joseph given?
于是约瑟在那里坐监。39:21但耶和华与约瑟同在，向他施恩，使他在司狱的眼前蒙恩。约瑟坐监的时候有什么事发生？39:22司狱就把监里所有的囚犯都交在约瑟手下。他们在那里所办的事都是经他的手。39:23凡在约瑟手下的事，司狱一概不察，因为耶和华与约瑟同在。耶和华使他所作的尽都顺利。尽管约瑟是一个囚犯，但是却被赋予了什么责任？
