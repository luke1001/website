Genesis 27 Jacob Gets Isaac's Blessing 创世纪27章 以撒祝福雅各
Isaac is now 137 years old; he lived an additional 43 years. Perhaps it was because of his blindness or other ailments, but Isaac believed he did not have long to live. A bigger problem arises from Isaac’s announced intention to pronounce the blessing on Esau, contrary to God’s intention (25:23). Jacob and Esau are 77 years old.
当时以撒已经137岁了；之后他在世上又活了43年。或许是因为失明或其它疾病，以撒认为自己将不久于人世。由于以撒想要给以扫祝福而产生了一个很大的问题，因为这与上帝的意愿相反（25:23）雅各和以扫已经77岁了。

(1) When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, "My son."
"Here I am," he answered.
(2) Isaac said, "I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death. What moved Isaac to give the birthright promise? (3) Now then, get your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. (4) Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die." Why was Isaac wrong to give the blessing to Esau? Why was Esau wrong to go along with Isaac’s plan?
1以撒年老，眼睛昏花，不能看见，就叫了他大儿子以扫来，说，我儿，
以扫说，我在这里。
2他说，我如今老了，不知道哪一天死。是什么促使以撒要为长子祝福？3现在拿你的器械，就是箭囊和弓，往田野去为我打猎，4照我所爱的作成美味，拿来给我吃，使我在未死之先给你祝福。以撒给以扫祝福为什么不对？以扫按着以撒所计划去行为什么不对？
(5) Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, (6) Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, (7) 'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.' Why was Rebekah right to be concerned abut Isaac’s plan to bless Esau? (8) Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: (9) Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. (10) Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies." What was Rebekah’s plan to counter Isaac’s desire to bless Esau?
5以撒对他儿子以扫说话，利百加也听见了。以扫往田野去打猎，要得野味带来。6利百加就对她儿子雅各说，我听见你父亲对你哥哥以扫说， 7你去把野兽带来，作成美味给我吃，我好在未死之先，在耶和华面前给你祝福。与以撒计划向以扫祝福相比较利百加作对了什么？8现在，我儿，你要照着我所吩咐你的，听从我的话。9你到羊群里去，给我拿两只肥山羊羔来，我便照你父亲所爱的给他作成美味。10你拿到你父亲那里给他吃，使他在未死之先给你祝福。利百加用什么计划来抵制以撒向以扫祝福的意图？
(11) Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I'm a man with smooth skin. (12) What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing." Why did Jacob express concern to his mother?
(13) His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me." Why was Rebekah not afraid of the curse?
(14) So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. (15) Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. (16) She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. How hairy would you describe Esau? (17) Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
11雅各对他母亲利百加说，我哥哥以扫浑身是有毛的，我身上是光滑的。 12倘若我父亲摸着我，必以我为欺哄人的，我就招咒诅，不得祝福。为什么雅各向他妈妈坦陈顾虑？
13他母亲对他说，我儿，你招的咒诅归到我身上。你只管听我的话，去把羊羔给我拿来。为什么利百加不怕招咒诅？
14他便去拿来，交给他母亲。他母亲就照他父亲所爱的作成美味。15利百加又把家里所存大儿子以扫上好的衣服给他小儿子雅各穿上，16又用山羊羔皮包在雅各的手上和颈项的光滑处，你会怎样描述以扫浑身长毛的程度？17就把所作的美味和饼交在他儿子雅各的手里。
(18) He went to his father and said, "My father." "Yes, my son," he answered. "Who is it?"
(19) Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your
blessing."

(20) Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" "The LORD your God gave me success," he replied.
(21) Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not." What does Isaac suspect?
(22) Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau." (23) He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. (24) "Are you really my son Esau?" he asked. Why does Isaac ask this question? "I am," he replied.
(25) Then he said, "My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. (26) Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me." What is Isaac still suspecting?
18雅各到他父亲那里说，我父亲。他说，我在这里。我儿，你是谁。
19雅各对他父亲说，我是你的长子以扫。我已照你所吩咐我的行了。请起来坐着，吃我的野味，好给我祝福。
20以撒对他儿子说，我儿，你如何找得这么快呢？他说，因为耶和华你的神使我遇见好机会得着的。
21以撒对雅各说，我儿，你近前来，我摸摸你，知道你真是我的儿子以扫不是。以撒在怀疑什么？
22雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他，说，声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手。23以撒就辨不出他来。因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样，就给他祝福。24又说，真是我儿子以扫吗？为什么以撒要问这个问题？他说，我是。25以撒说，你递给我，我好吃我儿子的野味，给你祝福。雅各就递给他，他便吃了，又拿酒给他，他也喝了。26他父亲以撒对他说，我儿，你上前来与我亲嘴。以撒依然在疑心什么？

(27) So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. (28) May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness—an abundance of grain and new wine. (29) May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed." What items did Isaac include in the blessing he gave to Jacob?
27他就上前与父亲亲嘴。他父亲一闻他衣服上的香气，就给他祝福，说，我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。28愿神赐你天上的甘露，地上的肥土，并许多五谷新酒。29愿多民事奉你，多国跪拜你。愿你作你弟兄的主。你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅。为你祝福的，愿他蒙福。以撒给雅各的祝福都包含什么？
(30) After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. (31) He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, "My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing."
(32) His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau."
(33) Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!" What thoughts do you think came to Isaac when he learned that Jacob had received the blessing instead of Esau?
30以撒为雅各祝福已毕，雅各从他父亲那里才出来，他哥哥以扫正打猎回来，31也作了美味，拿来给他父亲，说，请父亲起来，吃你儿子的野味，好给我祝福。
32他父亲以撒对他说，你是谁？他说，我是你的长子以扫。
33以撒就大大地战兢，说，你未来之先，是谁得了野味拿来给我呢？我已经吃了，为他祝福。他将来也必蒙福。你认为当以撒得知是雅各而非以扫得到了那祝福时会有什么想法？
(34) When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me—me too, my father!" (35) But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
(36) Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?" What does Esau want?
(37) Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?"
(38) Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.
(39) His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above. (40) You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck." How would you describe Esau’s blessing?
34以扫听了他父亲的话，就放声痛哭，说，我父阿，求你也为我祝福。35 以撒说，你兄弟已经用诡计来将你的福分夺去了。
36以扫说，他名雅各，岂不是正对吗？因为他欺骗了我两次。他从前夺了我长子的名分，你看，他现在又夺了我的福分。以扫又说，你没有留下为我可祝的福吗？以扫想要什么？
37以撒回答以扫说，我已立他为你的主，使他的弟兄都给他作仆人，并赐他五谷新酒可以养生。我儿，现在我还能为你作什么呢？
38以扫对他父亲说，父阿，你只有一样可祝的福吗？我父阿，求你也为我祝福。以扫就放声而哭。
39他父亲以撒说，地上的肥土必为你所住。天上的甘露必为你所得。40你必倚靠刀剑度日，又必事奉你的兄弟。到你强盛的时候，必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。你怎样形容以扫得到的祝福？

Jacob Flees to Laban
(41) Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob." What is Esau’s plan?
(42) When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you. (43) Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. (44) Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides. (45) When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?" What plan did Rebekah devise to save Jacob from Esau’s anger?
(46) Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living." What story did Rebekah tell Isaac to give his consent for Jacob to go to Laban?
雅各逃向拉班
41以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福，就怨恨雅各，心里说，为我父亲居丧的日子近了，到那时候，我要杀我的兄弟雅各。以扫作何打算？
42有人把利百加大儿子以扫的话告诉利百加，她就打发人去，叫了她小儿子雅各来，对他说，你哥哥以扫想要杀你，报仇雪恨。43现在，我儿，你要听我的话，起来，逃往哈兰，我哥哥拉班那里去，44同他住些日子，直等你哥哥的怒气消了。45 你哥哥向你消了怒气，忘了你向他所作的事，我便打发人去把你从那里带回来。为什么一日丧你们二人呢？利百加想出什么计划以救雅各脱离以扫的怒气？
46利百加对以撒说，我因这赫人的女子连性命都厌烦了。倘若雅各也娶赫人的女子为妻，像这些一样，我活着还有什么益处呢？利百加告诉以撒什么理由以使他赞同打发雅各去拉班那里？

NOTES注释
His eyes were so weak that he could no longer see – In ancient times, blindness and near blindness were common among elderly people
眼睛昏花，不能看见-在古时候，眼目昏花甚至失明的情况在老年人中很常见。

Your quiver and bow – The quiver was the box, or case, for arrows. Arrows were used in hunting as well as in combat. They were originally made of reeds and afterwards of any light wood. The bows were made of flexible wood and the bowstrings of leather, horsehair, or the tendons of animals. The quiver was slung over the shoulder in such a position that the soldier could draw out the arrows when wanted.
箭囊和弓-箭囊是一种盒子或箱子，用来存放箭支。箭支被用于狩猎以及战斗。箭支最早用芦苇制成后来采用各种轻质的木材。弓是由具柔韧性的木材和由皮革、马鬃或动物肌腱所做的弓弦组成。箭囊通常挂在肩头便于战士随时取用箭支的位置。


My blessing before I die – Oral statements including deathbed bequests had legal standing.
未死之先给你祝福-包含临终遗嘱的口述申明具有法律地位。

Do what I tell you – Rebekah is deceitful.
听从我的话-利百加不诚实

Young goats – The flesh of the wild goat of Palestine and Arabia is nearly of the flavor of venison. This explains how it was possible to make blink Isaac believe he was eating wild game.
山羊羔-在巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯半岛地区的野山羊肉和野味的滋味相近。这解释了为什么以撒会相信他吃的是狩猎得来的野味。

Indeed he will be blessed – The ancient world believed that blessings and curses had a kind of magical power.
他将来也必蒙福-古代世界相信祝福和咒诅都有种魔力。

Genesis 28:1-9
创世纪 28:1-9

(1) So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him and commanded him: "Do not marry a Canaanite woman. (2) Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. What important command did Isaac give Jacob? (3) May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. (4) May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien, the land God gave to Abraham." What is different about the second time that Jacob received the birthright blessing from his father? (5) Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
(6) Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, "Do not marry a Canaanite woman," (7) and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. (8) Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; (9) so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. What do you think about Esau’s reaction to Jacob being told not to marry a Canaanite woman?
1以撒叫了雅各来，给他祝福，并嘱咐他说，你不要娶迦南的女子为妻。2你起身往巴旦亚兰去，到你外祖彼土利家里，在你母舅拉班的女儿中娶一女为妻。以撒给了雅各什么重要的命令？3愿全能的神赐福给你，使你生养众多，成为多族，雅各第二次祝福他从父亲那里得到的长子的祝福有什么不同？4将应许亚伯拉罕的福赐给你和你的后裔，使你承受你所寄居的地为业，就是神赐给亚伯拉罕的地。5以撒打发雅各走了，他就往巴旦亚兰去，到亚兰人彼土利的儿子拉班那里。拉班是雅各，以扫的母舅。
6以扫见以撒已经给雅各祝福，而且打发他往巴旦亚兰去，在那里娶妻，并见祝福的时候嘱咐他说，不要娶迦南的女子为妻，7又见雅各听从父母的话往巴旦亚兰去了，8以扫就晓得他父亲以撒看不中迦南的女子，9便往以实玛利那里去，在他二妻之外又娶了玛哈拉为妻。他是亚伯拉罕儿子以实玛利的女儿，尼拜约的妹子。当以扫得知雅各被嘱咐不要娶迦南女子为妻时，你对以扫的回应行为有何想法？
