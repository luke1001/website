##### APPENDIX 2: EXPLANATION OF “A ‘HANDY’ WAY TO WITNESS.” 附件2：“顺手的”见证方式的解释

![](/images/note/fycd/7-7.jpg#right)

Thumb --Does their spiritual situation rate a thumbs up or a thumbs down?

Key Questions: If you died tonight, are you sure that you would be in heaven? Why are you (un)certain --or let me put it this way: If you died tonight and faced God and he asked you, 'Why should I let you into my heaven?' what would you say?

大拇指 - 他们属灵状况的比例是值得称赞还是应受责备的？

关键问题：假如你将在今晚去世，你确信你会进入天堂吗？为什么你(不)确信-或换种方式问你：如果你将在今晚去世，你面对上帝，他问你，‘为什么我应该让你进入我的天堂？’你会怎么说？

Passage: 1 John 5:13 These things are written ...so that you may know that you have eternal life. Illus.: A person writes a letter to let his friend know facts. (e.g. What's the new baby's name, when he is going to visit, etc.) God didn't write the Bible to leave you guessing.

经文：约翰一书5:13 这些话写给你们…要叫你们知道自己有永生。说明：一个人写了一封信要让他的朋友知道事实。(比如说，刚出生的宝宝的名字，他什么时候要去拜访，等等。)上帝没有写圣经让你去猜想。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 

Transition: I am certain of my eternity, may I share with you why I am certain and how you too could be certain of heaven?

转换：我确信我的永生，请允许我和你分享为什么我确信以及你如何也能确信有天堂。

Pointer --Point out man's sin.

God demands: Lev. 19:2 "Be holy {or perfect} because I the Lord your God am holy {perfect}. Illus.: A billionaire accepts only a flawless diamond, a perfect car etc. God, who is absolutely perfect accepts nothing less than perfection.

食指 – 指出人的罪。

上帝要求：利未记19:2“你们要圣洁{或完全}，因为我耶和华你们的神是圣洁的{完全的}。”说明：一个百万富翁只接受毫无瑕疵的钻石，完美的车等等。绝对完全的上帝只接受完全。

God sees: Romans 3:23 "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Illus.: Long jump across Grand Canyon -no one, even if he were an Olympic athlete could succeed at the jump -in the end the result would be the same for all, death. We all are short of perfection and deserve the same fate, eternal death. Or you want to go to a movie but don't have enough money. It doesn't matter if you are 5 cents short or $10 you won't get in. if we are even just one sin short of perfection we don't deserve to get into heaven.

上帝看见：罗马书3:23：“世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”说明：跳远跨越大峡谷 – 没有人能做到，就算他是赢得跳远奥林匹克选手 – 最终的结果也是和所有人一样，死亡。我们所有人都亏缺了完全并应得到同样的命运，永远的死亡。或者是你想要去看电影，但是没有足够的钱。无论你是差5美分还是10美元，你都进不了电影院。如果我们哪怕是犯了一个罪亏缺了完全，我们都不配进入天堂。

Result: Romans 6:23 "The wages of sin is death." Illus.: If we commit a crime, we are punished for doing wrong. (Death: separation- physical, spiritual, eternal)

结果：罗马书6:23“罪的工价乃是死。”说明：如果我们犯了罪，我们因做错了事而受到惩罚。(死：分离 – 肉体的，灵魂的，永远的)

Middle Finger (The longest finger) --Man thinks he is big enough to make it by himself 1) "I'll try harder" ladder --No one can make it all the way to the top which is perfection. Problem: go back to canyon illustration.

中指(最长的手指) -人类认为自己足够强大来弥补自己的罪。

1) “我要更加努力”架梯子 – 没有人能使它到达顶端即完全。 困难：回到有关峡谷的说明。

2) "I can balance my sins with being good" --One flaw ruins a diamond no matter how good the rest is. Or go back to canyon illustration.

2) “我能用善行平衡我的罪”- 一个瑕疵毁了一颗钻石无论其余部分多么好。或者回到有关峡谷的说明。

3) "But look how much better I am than..." --God will judge you alone and compare you to his own perfection (Draw in God’s leg)

3) “但是看看我比…好多了”- 上帝只单独审判你并将你与他自己的完全相比较(与上帝的腿对齐)

Passage: James 2:10 "Whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles at just one point, is guilty of breaking all of it."

经文：雅各书2:10“因为凡遵守全律法的，只在一条上跌倒，他就是犯了众条。”

Ring Finger (finger for wedding ring, symbol of love) --God's remedy is his love.

无名指(带婚戒的手指，爱的象征) – 上帝用他的爱作为补救的方式。

![](/images/note/fycd/7-10.jpg#center)


Passage: John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life." Illus.: Love motivates parent of dying child to do anything to save him, even give up his own life trying. God has such love for the whole world which includes you.

经文：约翰福音3:16“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子(耶稣)赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”说明：爱促使将死的孩子的父母愿意做任何事来拯救孩子，甚至是放弃自己生命的尝试。上帝对于世人包括你所具有的就是这样的爱。

Passage: 2 Corinthians 5:21 “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” OR Isaiah 53:6 "The Lord laid on him the iniquity {sin} of us all." Illus.: A superhero picked you up and carried you over the Grand Canyon. Or someone paid your admission to the movie you couldn't afford. Jesus Christ has done for you what you couldn't -be perfect. Jesus has paid with his blood the price you couldn't to get you into heaven.

经文：哥林多后书5:21“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”或是以赛亚书53:6“耶和华使我们众人的罪孽{罪}都归在他身上。”说明：一个超级英雄帮你一把，将你背过大峡谷。或者一个人支付你承担不了的看电影的费用。耶稣基督已经做了你做不到的事 – 是你完全。耶稣用自己的宝血为你付了赎价使你能够进入天堂。 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pinky --("I" in sign language) What Jesus did becomes theirs through faith which is created and sustained by God working through his Word.

小拇指 – (手语中是“我”的意思)藉着上帝的话语做工所创造和保守的信心使耶稣所做成为他们自己的

Passage: Romans 6:23 "The wages of sin is death, But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." OR Eph. 2:8,9 "By grace you have been saved, through faith -and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God” Illus.: A birthday gift is not earned. You do not in anyway earn eternal life; God has done it all.

经文：罗马书6:23“罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”或是以弗所书2:8,9“你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。”说明：一个生日礼物不是挣得的。你不可能通过任何方式挣得永生；是上帝做了一切。

Passage: Romans 10:17 "Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the Word of Christ." Illus.: Someone can know and trust that they are loved only if they are told about it. We know and trust we are loved by God (faith) only by what he has told us in his Word. A spouse or child needs to be reminded again and again that they are loved. The more it is heard the more they are certain of it. We need to again and again hear God say "I love you!" through his Word to build up our faith in his love.

经文：罗马书：10:17“可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。”说明：有一个人只有在他们被告知的情况下，才能明白和相信他们是被爱。我们明白和相信我们被上帝(信心)爱，只因为他在圣经中已经告诉我们了。配偶或孩子需要被反复提醒他们是被爱的。他们听道得越多就越确信。我们需要通过上帝的话语反复听到上帝说“我爱你！”来建立在他爱里的信心。

Open Hand: Inviting them to hear more about God's love.

摊开手掌 – 请求听到更多有关上帝的爱的话语。

Ask key questions again and find out if they followed you. Leave them with an outline of the law and gospel. Leave other literature or a Bible with them. Invite them to hear more thoroughly how God loves them in a Bible Information Class. Offer to attend this class with them. If they are not interested in such a commitment offer to personally explain more to them at a specific future time. Pray for them.

再一次问这些关键问题并看看他们是否明白你所说的。将律法与福音的概要留给他们。将其他说明或是圣经留给他们。邀请他们来圣经信息课程，更彻底地听有关上帝如何爱他们的内容。提供给他们参加这个课程的机会。如果他们对于在未来具体的时间里听到更多的解释没有兴趣。请为他们祷告。
