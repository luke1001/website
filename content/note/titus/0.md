### B. Titus 1 Translation 提多书第一章翻译

1) Paul, a servant of God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s elect and the knowledge of the truth that produces godliness. 2) on the firm assurance (hope) of eternal life, which the God who does not lie (is free from falsehood) has promised before the beginning of time (before times everlasting). 3) At His own determined time, He revealed His Word through message (proclamation) which was entrusted (committed) to me through the authoritative command of God our Savior. 4) To Titus, my true child according to common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior. 1 　神的仆人、耶稣基督的使徒保罗、凭着　神选民的信心、与敬虔真理的知识、 2 （以这样的信心和知识为基础）盼望那无谎言的　神、在万古之先所应许的永生、 3到了日期、借着传扬的工夫、把他的道显明了．这传扬的责任、是按着　神我们救主的命令交托了我。 4 现在写信给提多、就是照着我们共信之道作我真儿子的．愿恩惠平安、从父　神和我们的救主基督耶稣归与你。

5) I left you in Crete for this reason: that you might put in order the things that were left unfinished and appoint elders in each town (city), as I ordered you. 6) is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe and are not charged with wild behavior or disobedience. 7) Since a bishop (overseer, one in charge of a church) is a managing representative of God, he must be blameless, not selfish (arrogant), not easily angered (hot-tempered), not prone to drunkenness (literally, “staying near wine”), not quarrelsome (violent), not greedy. 8) Rather, hospitable (a lover of strangers), a lover of what is good, self-controlled (sensible), one who does right, holy (undefiled by sin), moderate (careful and controlled in one’s actions). 9) He must hold firmly to the trustworthy Word as it has been taught in order that he may be able to encourage others in the sound doctrine and to refute those who oppose it. 5 我从前留你在革哩底、是要你将那没有办完的事都办整齐了、又照我所吩咐你的、在各城（市）设立长老．6 若有无可指责的人、只作一个妇人的丈夫、儿女也是信主的、没有人告他们是放荡不服约束的、就可以设立（为长老）。 7 监督（主教，教会的管理者）既是　神的管家、必须无可指责、不任性、不暴躁、不因醉酒（原文的“醉酒”是“对酒的留恋”）滋事、不打人、不贪无义之财、 8 （他必须）乐意接待远人（爱陌生人）、好善、庄重、公平、圣洁、自持． 9 坚守所教真实的道理、就能将纯正的教训劝化人．又能把争辩的人驳倒了。

10) Because many are disobedient, senseless talkers and deceivers (mind-misleaders), especially those of the circumcision group. 11) These must be silenced. These are the kind who disrupt (turn over) entire households by teaching thing that must not be taught – and for the sake of shameful gain. 12) One of their very own prophets said: “Cretans are always liars, depraved dangerous animals, lazy gluttons.” 13) This testimony is true. Because of this valid accusation, rebuke them sharply (in a way that cuts) so that they may be sound in the faith, 14) and not pay attention to Jewish myths and to the commands (decrees) of people who turn away from the truth. 15) All things are pure to the pure. But to those who are corrupted (contaminated) and do not believe, nothing is pure. Rather, the mind and conscience of these people are corrupt. 16) They publicly claim to know God, but by works, they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit (not passing the test) for doing any good work. 10 因为有许多人不服约束、说虚空话、欺哄（误导）人．那奉割礼的、更是这样。 11 这些人的口总要堵住．他们因贪不义之财、将不该教导的教导人、败坏人的全家。 12 有革哩底人中的一个本地先知说、『革哩底人常说谎话、乃是恶兽、又馋又懒．』 13 这个见证是真的。所以你要严严的责备他们、使他们在真道上纯全无疵． 14 不听犹太人荒渺的言语、和离弃真道之人的诫命。 15 在洁净的人、凡物都洁净．在污秽不信的人、甚么都不洁净．连心地和天良、也都污秽了。 16 他们说是认识　神、行事却和他相背．本是可憎恶的、是悖逆的、在各样善事上是可废弃的。
