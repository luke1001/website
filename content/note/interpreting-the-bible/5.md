##### Rule #4 规则四
##### TO INTERPRET A BIBLE PASSAGE CORRECTLY, WE SHOULD STUDY THE HISTORICAL SETTING OF THE PASSAGE 为了正确地解释某一处经文，我们应该查考该处经文的历史背景。

The writers of the Bible wrote in the language of the time and place in which they lived.

圣经作者运用了他们当时所生活时代和地点的语言来写作。

The writers wrote about life situations that were common at their time.

作者所写的有关生活情境在当时时代是非常普遍的。

What they wrote was dependent upon the stage of God’s plan of salvation at which they lived. This is especially important to remember in studying the writings of the Old Testament.

他们所写的依靠于上帝对他们那个时期的救恩计划的阶段。这一点对于查考旧约的经卷极其重要。

So the Bible relates historical events that are connected to God’s plan of salvation, and the words and verses have a historical setting in which God chose to have his Word inspired.

因此，圣经将与上帝救恩计划相关的历史事件联系起来，并且，上帝选择用来默示的言语和经文都有着历史背景。

When we examine the historical setting of a passage we ask the questions: Who is speaking? To whom? Where? When? Why?

当我们查考该处经文的历史背景时，我们要问以下几个问题：谁在说话？对谁说的？在什么地方说的？什么时候说？为什么这样说？

##### THE HISTORICAL SETTING OF A PASSAGE SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO CHANGE THE SIMPLE MEANING OF THE PASSAGE. 该处经文的历史背景永不能用来改变该经文的字面意思。

The Bible itself provides much information about the historical setting of events. This is true, for example about Paul’s letter to the Philippians.

圣经本身提供了许多事件的历史背景的信息。这是真的，比如保罗所写的腓立比书就是如此。

We should study the places, persons, customs, and events that are mentioned in the Bible, but are not explained. For this we may use research books like Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias. However, this information should not be used to change the evident meaning of a Bible passage.

我们应当研究圣经中所提到但未被解释的地点、人物、风俗和实践。为此，我们可以使用像圣经字典和圣经百科全书这样的研究书籍。但是这些信息不能用来改变一段圣经经文的明显意思。

Examples: 例子： 

Psalm 23 诗23 ; Matthew 21 太 21

John 17 约 17 ; Luke 2 路2

* KNOW THE AUTHOR 

* 知道作者

For many books of the Bible, we know who wrote it. We know his experiences, his background, his education, etc. It is helpful to know his purpose for writing, and the time and place of writing.

对于圣经中的许多经卷，我们知道是谁写的。我们需要知道作者的经历，背景及其教育情况等等。这对于知道作者的写作意图、写作时间和地点都是非常有用的。

Examples: 例子：

Isaiah ； Daniel ； Matthew 

以赛亚 ； 但以理 ； 马太

*  KNOW THE PEOPLE TO WHOM OR ABOUT WHOM THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN 

* 知道圣经的第一读者或他们的情况。

This will include:

3\. The economic situation 经济处境

4\. The educational situation 教育现状
