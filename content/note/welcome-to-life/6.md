Review the Home Study questions from Lesson 5

复习第5课的课后作业的问题。

### I. The Holy Spirit's Person And Work, And The Means Of Grace 圣灵的位格和工作，以及恩典的管道

Matthew 28:19 —Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

马太福音28:19 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作“给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。

Acts 5:3a, 4b – Then Peter said, ”Ananias, How is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit…You have not lied to men, but to God.

使徒行传 5:3a,4b - 3a彼得说：“亚拿尼亚，为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，4b你不是欺哄人，是欺哄　神了！”

A. The Holy Spirit is true God, a distinct person of the Trinity. He is not a mere impersonal force or feeling.

圣灵是真正的神，是三位一体里独立的格。他不是一个纯粹的客观力量或感觉。

<br>

1 Peter 1:2 – （God's elect） have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by His blood.

彼得前书1:2 —就是照父　神的先见被拣选，藉着圣灵得成圣洁，以致顺服耶稣基督，又蒙他血所洒的人：愿恩惠、平安多多地加给你们！

John 14:26 – But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

约翰福音14:26 —但保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，他要将一切的事指教你们，并且要叫你们想起我对你们所说的一切话。

John 16:13a - 14 – But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth. 14He will bring glory to Me by taking from what is Mine and making it known to you.

约翰福音 16:13a,14 ——13a 只等真理的圣灵来了，他要引导你们明白（原文作“进入”）一切的真理，14 他要荣耀我，因为他要将受于我的告诉你们。

B. The Holy Spirit's work is called sanctification. “To sanctify” is “to make holy” or “to set apart from sin for God.”

圣灵的工作叫做成圣。“使成圣”指的是“使神圣化”或“为神远离罪恶”.

1. Sanctification includes all the Holy Spirit does to bring people out of the unbelieving world to saving faith in Christ, to empower them to live to God's glory and to preserve them in faith until they enter heaven.

    成圣包括圣灵做的所有的，把人从不信的世界里拉出来，归到基督里的救赎的信心的工作，并且给人力量得以过荣耀神的生活，同时保持人的信心，一直到信徒进天堂为止。

2. As the Sanctifier, the Spirit uses the Word of God to lead people to trust in and honor Jesus as Savior and Lord.

    作为成圣的圣灵，圣灵通过神的话语引导人们信靠，尊敬作为救主和神的耶稣。

C. The Bible gives other names to the Holy Spirit, such as: Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, Spirit of Truth, Comforter, Counselor.

圣经也用其他的名字来称呼圣灵，比如：神的灵，基督的灵，真理的灵，保惠师，顾问。

<br>

2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 – But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

帖撒罗尼迦后书 2:13,14——13主所爱的弟兄们哪，我们本该常为你们感谢　神，因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。14神藉我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。

Romans 1:16 – I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.

罗马书1:16 -我不以福音为耻；这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人。

D. The Holy Spirit works through the means of the Gospel （Good News） to accomplish His sanctifying work.

圣灵通过福音（好消息）的工具来做工，完成成圣的工作。

1. We call the Gospel in its forms of the Word and the two Sacraments of Holy Baptism and Holy Communion the means of grace.

    我们把福音称作消息，把两个圣礼<br>施洗和圣餐称为恩典的管道。

2. The Gospel is the means by which the Spirit offers and gives to us the undeserved love of God for us in Christ, so that we are brought to and kept in saving faith.

    福音是圣灵在基督里给予我们不配得的神的爱的方式，这样我们才被带到救赎的信心里，并且保持下去。

### II. The Holy Spirit Works Saving Faith 圣灵生发得救的信心

Romans 4:5 – However, to the person who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness

罗马书4:5—惟有不做工的，只信称罪人为义的神，他的信就算为义。

Romans 5:1-2 – Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.

罗马书5:1,2——1我们既因信称义，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督得与　神相和。2我们又藉着他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。

A. We receive the blessings of Jesus' redeeming work as our own through God's gift of faith in Jesus as our Savior, apart from our works.

通过神给予我们信心，使我们相信耶稣是救主，耶稣的救赎工作成为我们领受的恩惠，而不是我们自己做工救赎自己。

<br>

Romans 10:9-10 – That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.

罗马书 10:9-10 ——9你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信　神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。10因为人心里相信，就可以称义；口里承认，就可以得救。

B. The nature of saving faith.

得救的信心之本质

1. Saving faith is the heart's trust and confidence in Jesus Christ and His finished work of redemption for the forgiveness of our sins and eternal life.

    得救的信心是我们心里对耶稣基督和他完成的救赎工作，赦免我们的罪，给我们天堂的永生的信靠和信心。

2. Saving faith is not situational faith, a faith which trusts God only for physical blessings in certain situations of this life （such as safety, health, and income）。 Saving faith trusts Jesus for spiritual and eternal blessings in Christ as well as for physical ones.

    得救的信心不是有条件的信心，有条件的信心指的是，仅仅因为神在某些情况下赐予物质恩惠（比如安全，健康，收入）才信。 得救的信心指的是，相信耶稣基督里的灵性和永生的恩惠，同时也相信物质恩惠。

3. Saving faith is not a mere intellectual knowledge of facts about God. Saving faith knows the facts and believes in the benefit of those facts. Head knowledge says: “Jesus died.” Saving faith says: “Jesus died for me.”

    得救的信心不仅仅是头脑上对神的了解。得救的信心知晓事实，并且相信事实带来的恩惠。头脑的知识会说：“耶稣死了。”而得救的信心则说：“耶稣为我而死。”

4. Saving faith is not faith in the God of possibilities, a faith which believes that God can do things. Saving faith knows that God does do things. God not only can save; He does save us in Jesus.

    得救的信心不是相信神的能耐，不是相信神能做到。得救的信心知道神确实本就能够做到。神不仅能拯救，也确实本来就是在拯救我们。

5. Saving faith is not merely a good feeling or general optimism about life.

    得救的信心不仅仅是一种好的感觉或者生活的一般的乐观态度。

6. Saving faith is not self-confidence.

    得救的信心不是自信。

C. People cannot bring themselves to saving faith

人们不能自行获得得救的信心。

<br>

2 Corinthians 4:4 – The god of this age （Satan） has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

哥林多后书4:4 -此等不信之人，被这世界的神弄瞎了心眼，不叫基督荣耀福音的光照着他们。基督本是神的像。

1. We are by nature spiritually blind. We can't see the truth of God.

    我们本性里，灵性就瞎了。我们不能看见神的真道。

    <br>

    Ephesians 2:1 – As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins.

    以弗所书2:1 -你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。

2. We are by nature spiritually dead to God. We have not power to resurrect ourselves.

    我们在本性里，就是在灵里死去了。我们没有力量使自己复活。

    <br>

    Romans 8:7 – The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law nor can it do so.

    罗马书8:7 - 原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇，因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。

3. We are by nature God's enemies and refuse Him. We would rather depend on ourselves.

    我们本性里就是与神为敌，拒绝神。我们宁愿自己靠自己。

    <br>

    1 Corinthians 2:14 – The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

    哥林多前书2:14- 然而，属血气的人不领会神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。

3. By nature, we do not accept God's truth and consider it foolishness.

    我们生来本性就不接受神的真道，并且把它看做是愚蠢的东西。

D. The Holy Spirit persuades and creates faith through the Gospel.

圣灵通过福音规劝，并且建立信心。

<br>

1 Thessalonians 1:5a, 6b – Because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. 6b You welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.

帖撒罗尼迦前书 1:5,6——5因为我们的福音传到你们那里，不独在乎言语，也在乎权能和圣灵，并充足的信心。正如你们知道我们在你们那里，为你们的缘故是怎样为人；6并且你们在大难之中蒙了圣灵所赐的喜乐，领受真道，就效法我们，也效法了主，

1 Corinthians 2:4-5 – My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.

哥林多前书2:4，5——4我说的话，讲的道，不是用智慧委婉的言语，乃是用圣灵和大能的明证， 5叫你们的信不在乎人的智慧，只在乎神的大能。

Romans 4:20-21 – Yet he （Abraham） did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what He had promised.

罗马书 4:20-21 ——20并且仰望神的应许，总没有因不信，心里起疑惑，反倒因信，心里得坚固，将荣耀归给神。21且满心相信神所应许的必能作成。

1. The Holy Spirit works powerfully through the Gospel to work faith in Christ in people's hearts.

    圣灵通过福音，强有力的在人的心里做工，将信靠耶稣基督种在人心里。

2. The Spirit uses the Good News of Jesus to convince people of its truth and to persuade them to willingly and joyfully trust in God's grace for them.

    圣灵使用耶稣的福音使人们相信里面的真道，使人能够愿意相信，欣然接受神的恩典。

E. God alone brings people to faith.

单单神就能使人信靠。

Ephesians 2:8-9 – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God – not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书2:8-9 ——8你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的； 9也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

1 Corinthians 12:3b – No one can say, “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.

哥林多前书 12:3b -若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说耶稣是主的。

1. Saving faith in Jesus is God's gracious gift to us.

    在耶稣里得救的信心是神给我们慈爱的礼物。

2. Although it is people who have faith in Jesus, the Holy Spirit creates that faith in their hearts.

    虽然是人们信靠耶稣，但是是圣灵在人心里建立了信心。

3. It is wrong for people to believe that they can do something to come to faith in Jesus.

    人们认为自己可以做些事情就能获得救赎的信心，这是错误的。

4. This faulty belief is based on the false idea that a person, by nature, has freedom of the will in spiritual matters.

    这个错误的观点建立在这样的一个错误的想法上<br>人生来就有灵性上的自由意志。

5. The Bible teaches that since the Fall into Sin, people, by nature, are dead and hostile to God and have free will only in earthly matters, not in spiritual matters.

    圣经教导人们，自从犯罪堕落，人就在本性上，灵里死了，与神为敌，只有在俗世的事情上才有自由意志，而在灵性方面没有。

6. Our salvation from beginning to end is God's entirely work and gift.

    我们获得救赎，自始至终都是神的工作和恩赐。

F. The Holy Spirit works great changes when He brings people to faith.

圣灵使人信靠时，就会在人里面带来很大的变化。

1. The Holy Spirit works radical changes in people's hearts by bringing them to faith in Christ. In the Bible, God uses a variety of ways to describe those changes.

    圣灵通过带给人基督里的信心，在人心里做工，带来深刻的改变。在圣经里，神使用多种方式来描述这些变化。

    Acts 11:18b – So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.

    使徒行传 11:18b – “这样看来，神也赐恩给外邦人，叫他们悔改得生命了。”

2. The Spirit gives us repentance.

    圣灵叫人悔改。

    a. “Repentance” in the original Greek means “a change of mind and heart.”

    “悔改”在原来的希腊文里面意思是“思想和心灵的改变。”

    b. Repentance has two parts: contrition and faith

    悔改有2个部分：悔罪与信心

    （1）。 Contrition is heartfelt sorrow over sin and fear of God's punishment worked by the law.

    悔罪是对罪深切的悲痛，并且害怕律法带来的神的惩罚。

    （2）。 Faith is the heart's trust and comfort in God's forgiveness of sin for Christ's sake worked through the Gospel.

    信心是相信神借着基督所做的，赦免了罪（通过福音实现），并且从中获得了安慰。

    c. A repentant person has his/her mind and heart changed in two important ways by the Spirit.

    圣灵给一个悔改的人的头脑和心灵带来了两种方式的重要的改变。

    （1）。 The Spirit leads us to hate sin and to seek to avoid it instead of liking it and following it.

    圣灵引导人去痛恨罪， 并且想办法避免罪，而不是喜欢罪，追随罪。

    （2）。 The Spirit leads us to love God and to seek to do His will instead of hating God and rebelling against Him.

    圣灵引导人爱神，努力按照神意志做事，而不是恨神，忤逆神。

    <br>

    2 Corinthians 4:6 – For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

    哥林多后书4:6 —那吩咐光从黑暗里照出来的神，已经照在我们心里，叫我们得知神荣耀的光，显在耶稣基督的面上。

3. The Spirit cures our spiritual blindness and enables us to see Christ as our Savior and to view everything else in a new light （Enlightenment）。

    圣灵治愈我们灵里的盲目，使我们可以看见基督是我们的救主，看其他的事情也是用一种新的角度。（启迪）

    <br>

    Ephesians 2:4-5 – But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.

    以弗所书 2:4，5 ——4然而神既有丰富的怜悯，因他爱我们的大爱，5当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来（你们得救是本乎恩）。

4. The Spirit ends our spiritual death by raising us to new life in Christ （Spiritual resurrection）。

    圣灵使我们的灵命不再死去，而是在基督里给我们灵命的新生（灵里的复活）

    <br>

    1 Peter 2:25 – For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

    Jeremiah 31:18b – Restore me, and I will return, because You are the Lord my God.

    彼得前书2:25  -你们从前好像迷路的羊，如今却归到你们灵魂的牧人监督了。

    耶利米书 31:18 —我听见以法莲为自己悲叹说：‘你责罚我，我便受责罚，像不惯负轭的牛犊一样。求你使我回转，我便回转，因为你是耶和华我的神。“

    a. The Spirit turns us, enemies of God, back toward Him so that instead of hating God we love Him. （Conversion）。

    圣灵使我们不再是神的敌人，而是回到神那里，这样，我们不是恨神，而是爱神了。（转变）

    <br>

    1 Peter 1:23 – For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.

    彼得前书 1:23 —你们蒙了重生，不是由于能坏的种子，乃是由于不能坏的种子，是藉着神活泼常存的道。

    b. The Spirit gives us a second birth, a spiritual one in which we are alive in God         （Rebirth）。

    圣灵给我们灵里的新生<br>-我们在神里面重生。（新生）

### III. Why Some Are Saved While Others are Lost 为何有人获救而有人沉沦

Romans 5:18 – Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.

罗马书5:18 —如此说来，因一次的过犯，众人都被定罪；照样，因一次的义行，众人也就被称义得生命了。

Matthew 7:13- 14 – ”Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

马太福音 7:13，14 ——13你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡，那门是宽的，路是大的，进去的人也多； 14引到永生，那门是窄的，路是小的，找着的人也少。

A. Although God has declared all people forgiven of their sins because of Jesus' redeeming work, only some will actually be saved and have eternal life.

虽然神宣布所有人因为耶稣的救赎工作，罪得赦免，只有一小部分人才能获得真正的拯救和天堂的永生。

B. Why some are saved while others are lost is a great mystery that should cause us to listen carefully to what God says about it in His Word.

为何有的人获救而另外的人迷路？这是一个大奥妙，这使我们更加要仔细聆听神的话语在这个方面的真道。

<br>

Romans 3:9a, 22b-23 – What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! …22bThere is no difference, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

罗马书3:9a,22b,23 - 9a这却怎么样呢？我们比他们强吗？决不是的。 22b并没有分别。 23因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀；

C. All people are equally unworthy of God's grace, unable to convert themselves and unwilling to be converted. There is no difference in people.

所有人都同样不配得神的恩典，都不能够自己改变自己，也不愿意被改变。所有人都一样。

<br>

2 Peter 3:9 – The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

彼得后书 3:9 -主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。

1 Timothy 2:4 – God who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.

提摩太前书 2:4 -他愿意万人得救，明白真道。

Romans 2:11 – For God does not show favoritism.

罗马书 2:11 -因为神不偏待人。

D. God equally desires that everyone be saved and none be lost. He works through the same powerful Gospel to accomplish this. There is no difference in God.

神一视同仁的希望人人得救，无一人迷路。神通过力量同等强大的福音来实现这些。神眼里没有偏待。

E. Yet there are different outcomes. Some who hear the Gospel believe, while others who hear it do not.

但是众人的结局不同。有的人听闻福音就相信，而有人听闻福音也不相信。

<br>

Ephesians 2:8-9 – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书 2:8-9 ——8你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；9也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

F. God tells us that those who are saved are saved by His grace alone. God is fully responsible for their salvation.

神告诉人，那些得救的靠的仅仅是神的恩典。神对救赎完全负责。

<br>

Matthew 23:37 – “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.

马太福音 23:37 -耶路撒冷啊，耶路撒冷啊！你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下，只是你们不愿意。

Acts 7:51 – ”You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!

使徒行传 7:51 -你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵；你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样！

G. God tells us that those who are lost are lost by their own fault. They refuse the Spirit's efforts to work faith in their hearts and reject God's grace in unbelief.

神告诉人们，那些迷路的是因为自己的过犯迷路。他们拒绝圣灵在他们心里做工获得信心，拒绝神施给不信的人的恩典。

H. The Bible's teaching on these matters presents a difficulty for human reason.

人的理性思维很难理解圣经对于这些事情的教导。

1. It is tempting to set aside what God says in His Word and to search for an answer that will be more pleasing to human reason. But if we do so, we will fall into errors as others have.

    人们很容易不理睬神的话，而是去寻求一个人的思维看起来更容易接受的答案。但是如果我们这样做，我们就会像其他人那样犯错。

2. Some have concluded that some people believe while others don't because there is a difference in people.

    有人归结道，有的人信而有的人不信，是因为人有区别。

    a. They insist that some people are naturally more able and willing than others to cooperate with God in coming to faith and/or are more deserving of His favor.

    他们坚持认为，有的人生来更加能够，也更加愿意与神合作，最终获得信心，或者他们更加配得神的恩典。

    b. This teaching denies God's teaching in the Bible that people are equally powerless and hostile to God by nature.

    这个教导否认了神在圣经里的教导人们生来都是同样没有力量，同样敌对神。

    c. It also denies salvation by God's undeserved love and requires people to look to themselves as the cause （at least in part） for their being saved.

    这同样也否认人获得救赎是因为自己不配得的神的爱，这种说法也从人自身（至少部分）找原因，为获得救赎解释。

    d. In doing so, this erring teaching undercuts any proper assurance of salvation because it forces a sinful person to ask the question: “Have I done enough so I can be saved?” Because a sinful person can never do enough to satisfy God's demands for perfection, the person is caught up in a hopeless trap that can give him/her no real certainty and peace.

    这样做时，这种错误的教导也削弱了正确得救的确据，因为它迫使一个罪人问：“我是否做了足够的事情，确保能够得救？”因为一个罪人无法做足够好的事情满足神对完美无罪的要求，那么这个人就陷入了一个绝望的陷阱，这个陷阱无法给他/她真正的保障和内心平安。

3. Others have concluded that some believe while others don't because there is a difference in God.

    也有人认为，有些人信而有些人不信，是因为神要这种区别。

    a. They insist that from eternity God chose some to be saved while He destined all other to be damned.

    他们认为，一开始神就拣选了一些要获救的，同时注定所有其他人下地狱。

    b. This teaching contradicts God's teaching in the Bible that He sincerely wants all people to be saved. This teaching also makes God out to be dishonest and malicious.

    这种教导与圣经里神的教导矛盾-神要所有人都获救。这种教导也使神看起来不诚实，恶意。

    c. It also causes a person to be in doubt whether God has chosen him/her for heaven or hell.

    这也使人怀疑神是否已经拣选了他（天堂永生还是下地狱）

    <br>

    2 Corinthians 10:5 – We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

    哥林多后书10:5 -将各样的计谋，各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事，一概攻破了，又将人所有的心意夺回，使他都顺服基督。

    Romans 11:33 – Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!

    罗马书 11:33 -深哉，神丰富的智慧和知识！他的判断何其难测！他的踪迹何其难寻！

I. God's teaching on why some are saved while others are lost is a call for us to make our human reason subject to God's Word and to humbly adore His superior wisdom.

神教导我们：为什么有人获救，而其他人迷路，是呼召我们将自己人的思维臣服于神的话语，并且谦卑的喜爱神无上的智慧。

### IV. God's Election Or Predestination To Eternal Life 神的拣选或永生的预定

2 Timothy 1.9 – God who has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of His own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time.

提摩太后书 1:9 —神救了我们，以圣召召我们，不是按我们的行为，乃是按他的旨意和恩典；这恩典是万古之先在基督耶稣里赐给我们的。

Ephesians 1:3-6 – Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight. In love He predestined us to be adopted as His sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with His pleasure and will— to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the One He loves.

以弗所书 1:3-6 ——3愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神！他在基督里曾赐给我们天上各样属灵的福气。4就如神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们，使我们在他面前成为圣洁，无有瑕疵； 5又因爱我们，就按着自己意旨所喜悦的，预定我们藉着耶稣基督得儿子的名分， 6使他荣耀的恩典得着称赞。这恩典是他在爱子里所赐给我们的。

Romans 8:29-30 – For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.

罗马书 8:29,30 ——29因为他预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法他儿子的模样，使他儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。30预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。

A. God has not destined any people from eternity to be damned.

神最开始没有预定任何人下地狱。

B. However, the Bible does teach that from eternity God in grace has elected or chosen people to be brought to faith in Christ and preserved in that faith to eternal life.

然而，圣经也确实教导说，从太初，神在恩典里就拣选了信靠基督的人，并且保守信心，直到天堂永生。

C. God intends that His choosing or predestining of believers will be a great comfort and encouragement to them, especially in times of spiritual weakness and confusion.

神 的用意是，他的拣选或预定信徒会给他们带来极大的安慰和鼓舞，尤其是在灵里软弱困惑时。

D. He wants Christians to know that their salvation is not a matter of mere chance or of their own choice or deserving.

神要人知道，他们的获救不是仅仅的一个机会或者自己的选择，或者是自己配得。

E. God reveals to His believers that their salvation is the result of His eternal plan and loving purpose for them, which He works out during their life as He brings them and keeps them in faith in Jesus through their use of the Word and Sacraments and then completes when He takes them to eternal glory.

神向信徒揭示，他们的获救是神永生的计划和慈爱的目的的结果，神在他们的人生里运作救赎计划，通过神的话语，圣礼，人们获得救赎的信心，并且将在基督里的信心保守下去，最后在神把信徒带入永生的荣耀里的时候，就标志这个计划的完成。

F. This Gospel teaching gives believers great assurance of God's eternal love for them and of their salvation. It also encourages them to bear life's trials patiently and to live their lives to God's glory faithfully.

这个福音的教导给信徒安心，使他们知道神一直爱他们，并且拯救他们。这个教导也鼓励信徒耐心的忍受生活的磨难，并且忠实的活出神的荣耀。

### V. Those Who Do Not Hear The Gospel 那些没有听闻福音的人

John 14:6 – Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life: No one comes to the Father except through Me.”

约翰福音 14:6 —耶稣说：“我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。

Romans 10:14b – And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?

罗马书 10:14b —未曾听见他，怎能信他呢？

A. Some people accuse God of being unfair by claiming that He has no right to condemn unbelievers to hell if they have not had the opportunity to believe in Jesus by hearing the Gospel.

有的人指控神不公，说，如果有的人因为没有听闻福音，失去了信基督的机会，神就没有权利谴责不信者下地狱。

<br>

Job 41:11a – ”Who has a claim against Me that I must pay?“

约伯记 41:11a —谁先给我什么，使我偿还呢？

Romans 9:14-15 – What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For He says to Moses, ”I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.“

罗马书 9:14-15 ——14这样，我们可说什么呢？难道神有什么不公平吗？断乎没有！15因他对摩西说：”我要怜悯谁，就怜悯谁；要恩待谁，就恩待谁。“

B. At the heart of this charge is an assumption that God is obligated to give people an opportunity to hear the Gospel. He is not.

这个指控的核心是一个假设，假设神有义务给人们机会听闻福音。神没这义务。

1. No one has a ”right“ to hear the Gospel. In fact, people's sins disqualify them from any claim on God or His favor.

    没有人有”权利“听闻福音。实际上，人的罪性妨碍人们听闻神的教导或接受神的恩惠。

2. The fact that God does give opportunities is an act of His undeserved love and mercy.

    神给人机会听闻福音，是因为神把人不配得的爱给予了人，显示出神的仁慈。

    <br>

    Romans 10:18 – But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”

    罗马书 10:18 – 但我说，人没有听见吗？诚然听见了。“他们的声音传遍天下，他们的言语传到地极。”

    Acts 14:17 a – Yet God has not left Himself without testimony.

    使徒行传14:17a – 然而为自己未尝不显出证据来，

C. God has given people enough in-born knowledge and other testimony to know He exists and that they should seek to know more of His will. People who do not seek out God have only themselves to blame.

神给了人足够的天生的知识和其他证据，使人知道，神是存在的，人应该努力更多的了解神的旨意。那些不寻求神的人，只能责怪自己。

<br>

Matthew 10:7,8b – As you go, preach this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is near.' Freely you have received, freely give.

马太福音 10:7,8b –- 7随走随传，说：’天国近了！‘ 8b你们白白地得来，也要白白地舍去。

1 Corinthians 9:16b – Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.

D. God has also charged those who have heard the Gospel to share it with others.

神也吩咐那些听闻福音的人与他人分享福音。

1. Those who fail to do this also bear responsibility if some do not have an opportunity to hear the Gospel.

    那些没有这样做的，如果其他人没有机会听闻福音，也有责任。

2. This truth stirs us to be diligent in sharing the Gospel personally and through our church's mission efforts with all the people we can.

    这个真道激励我们自己要勤奋的传福音，与教会的事工一起努力传福音，把福音传给所有我们能遇见的人。

### VI. The Holy Spirit Lives In The Christian And Creates A New Life 圣灵住在基督徒里，并且创造新生命。

Ephesians 1:13b-14 – Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of His glory.

以弗所书 1:13b-14  ——13b既然信他，就受了所应许的圣灵为印记。14这圣灵是我们得基业的凭据（原文作“质”），直等到　神之民（“民”原文作“产业”）被赎，使他的荣耀得着称赞。

2 Corinthians 1:21b-22 – He anointed us, set His seal of ownership on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

哥林多后书 1:21b-22 ——21b他膏我们。 22他又用印印了我们，并赐圣灵在我们心里作凭据（原文作“质”）。

Romans 8:15-17 – For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by Him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory.

罗马书 8:15-17 ——15你们所受的不是奴仆的心，仍旧害怕；所受的乃是儿子的心，因此我们呼叫：“阿爸，父！” 16圣灵与我们的心同证我们是　神的儿女；17既是儿女，便是后嗣，就是　神的后嗣，和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦，也必和他一同得荣耀。

A. When the Holy Spirit brings people to faith in Christ, He also comes to live in their hearts.

当圣灵带领人获得基督里的信心，也会住在他们的心里。

1. By His dwelling in believers, the Spirit is God's seal of ownership, testifying to believers that they belong to God as His children.

    藉着住在信徒里面，圣灵是神用印印了我们，宣告我们是神的凭据，证明给信徒，他们是神的儿女。

2. By His living in believers, the Spirit is also God's deposit, guaranteeing by His testimony that believers are God's heirs who will receive the glorious inheritance of heaven.

    通过住在信徒里面，圣灵也是神的质押，用圣灵的证据保证信徒是神的后裔，他们会获得天堂的荣耀继承。

    <br>

2 Corinthians 5:17 – Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!

哥林多后书 5:17 —若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人。旧事已过，都变成新的了。

Galatians 5:16-17 – So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.

加拉太书 5:16-17  ——16我说：你们当顺着圣灵而行，就不放纵肉体的情欲了。 17因为情欲和圣灵相争，圣灵和情欲相争。这两个是彼此相敌，使你们不能作所愿意作的。

Ephesians 4:22-24 – You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

以弗所书 4:22-24  ——22就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的。 23又要将你们的心志改换一新， 24并且穿上新人，这新人是照着神的形像造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。

Romans 8:8-9 – Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.

罗马书8:8-9 ——8而且属肉体的人不能得神的喜欢。9如果神的灵住在你们心里，你们就不属肉体，乃属圣灵了。人若没有基督的灵，就不是属基督的。

B. When the Holy Spirit brings people to faith in Christ, He also makes them new creatures by creating in them a new nature.

当圣灵引导人归向基督的信心时，也通过在人里面创造新的特性，使人获得新生。

1. This spiritual nature or new self trusts in God, love Him, delights in what is true and good and leads the Christian to do God's will.

    这个灵性特质或者新的自己相信神，爱神，喜欢真理和良善，引导基督徒按照神的旨意行事。

2. This new nature is in constant conflict with the sinful nature or old self which everyone has from birth. The sinful nature rebels against God, hates Him, delights in evil and leads the Christian to disobey God's will.

    这个新的特性不断与与生俱来的罪性或者旧的自己征战。罪性忤逆神，恨神，以邪恶为乐，使基督徒违抗神的旨意。

3. The Holy Spirit strengthens the spiritual nature through the Gospel so that this nature can stay in control of the Christian's life and struggle successfully against the defiant sinful nature throughout life.

    圣灵通过福音加固灵性特质，为了使这个特质能一直掌控基督徒的生活，并且在与忤逆的罪性一生的征战里，获得胜利。

4. God will destroy the sinful nature of believers when they enter heaven.

    当信徒进天堂时，神会摧毁信徒的罪性。

5. The two natures of a Christian:

    基督徒的2个特性：

    ![](/images/note/hyldsmkc/6-1.jpg#center)

6. Insight into the two natures helps us understand our inner spiritual conflicts and outward behavior.

    对于这2个特性的理解有助于我们理解我们内在的灵里的征战和外在的行为。

    <br>

    Romans 13:11a, 14 – And, do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber. 14Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

    罗马书 13:11a, 14 — 11a再者，你们晓得现今就是该趁早睡醒的时候。14总要披戴主耶稣基督，不要为肉体安排去放纵私欲。

7. This knowledge keeps us spiritually alert and challenges us not to indulge the evil drives of the sinful nature, but to keep our spiritual nature strong by feeding it well with God's Word. 

    这个教导保持我们灵里的警醒，强烈建议我们不要沉迷于罪性的邪恶驱使，而是通过努力汲取神的话语，保持灵性的坚固。

### VII. The Holy Spirit Produces Godly Qualities And God-Pleasing Works 圣灵产生神性的特质和悦纳神的工作

Galatians 5:22-23a – But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

加拉太书5:22-23a ——22圣灵所结的果子，就是仁爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐、恩慈、良善、信实、23a温柔、节制。

A. The Holy Spirit produces a number of godly virtues in believers that aid them in living God-honoring, people-serving lives.

圣灵在信徒里产生很多神性的美德，美德帮助他们过荣耀神的，服务他人的生活。

<br>

腓立比书 2:13 —因为你们立志行事，都是神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。

Ephesians 2:10 – For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

以弗所书2:10 —我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。

B. The Holy Spirit also gives Christians the desire and the strength to do good works which He wants from His believers.

圣灵也给基督徒行善的意愿和力量，善行也是圣灵希望信徒做的事情。

<br>

John 15:5 – I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in Me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from Me you can do nothing.

约翰福音 15:5 —我是葡萄树，你们是枝子；常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能做什么。

Galatians 5:6b – The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.

加拉太书5:6b – 惟独使人生发仁爱的信心才有功效。

John 14:15 – “If you love Me, you will obey what I command.”

    神悦纳的好行为是一个基督徒出于爱神和在基督里的信心，按照神的旨意做的，为的是荣耀神，服务他人。

    <br>

    Galatians 2:16 – We know that a person is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ…， because by observing the law no one will be justified.

    加拉太书 2:16-既知道人称义不是因行律法，乃是因信耶稣基督，连我们也信了基督耶稣，使我们因信基督称义，不因行律法称义，因为凡有血气的，没有一人因行律法称义。

2. Our good works do not save us or make us righteous before God.

    我们的好行为不能拯救我们，也不能使我们在神面前称义。

    <br>

    Colossians 3:17 – And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.

以赛亚书 64:6 —我们都像不洁净的人，所有的义都像污秽的衣服；我们都像叶子渐渐枯干，我们的罪孽好像风把我们吹去。

C. Good works pleasing to God are not the same works that people may regard as ”good.“

神悦纳的好行为不能等同于人们所认为的好行为。

1. Sometimes people confuse good works that please God with works that people may commend and praise as good.

    有时候人们把神悦纳的好行为与人们称赞的好行为混为一谈。

2. God looks at more than the outward action. He also looks at the motivation behind it.

    神不仅仅看外在的行动。神也看行动背后的动机。

3. Works that are not prompted by faith in Christ and love for God proceed from sinful, selfish motivation （Such as fear of punishment or desire for reward） that God cannot accept as spiritually pleasing to Him.

    谨防把单单讲道德，外在的彬彬有礼和良善与神悦纳的好行为等同。

### VIII. The Holy Spirit Strengthens For The Struggle Against Sin And Unbelief 圣灵为与罪和不信的征战加添力量

Romans 6:11-12, 18 – In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. 18 You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.

罗马书 6:11-12,18 —— 11这样，你们向罪也当看自己是死的；向神在基督耶稣里，却当看自己是活的。12所以，不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺从身子的私欲。

18你们既从罪里得了释放，就作了义的奴仆。

1 Timothy 6:12 – Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.

提摩太前书 6:12 —你要为真道打那美好的仗，持定永生。你为此被召，也在许多见证人面前已经作了那美好的见证。

B. God the Holy Spirit strengthens Christians through God's powerful Word to carry on that battle

圣灵藉着神有力的话语，使基督徒刚强，得以继续征战。

<br>

腓立比书 1:25b —且与你们众人同住，使你们在所信的道上又长进、又喜乐。

2 Thessalonians 1:3b – Your faith is growing more and more and love is increasing.

帖撒罗尼迦后书 1:3b —因你们的信心格外增长，并且你们众人彼此相爱的心也都充足。

2 Corinthians 7:1 – Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.

哥林多后书 7:1 —亲爱的弟兄啊，我们既有这等应许，就当洁净自己，除去身体灵魂一切的污秽，敬畏神，得以成圣。

C. The Holy Spirit helps Christians make progress in their struggle against sin and unbelief. He helps them resist sin and strive to live holy lives.

圣灵帮助基督徒在与罪和不信征战里取得进步。圣灵帮助他们抵制罪的诱惑，努力过圣洁的生活。

<br>

1 John 1:8 – If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.

约翰一书 1:8 —我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了；

Philippians 3:12a – Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect.

腓立比书 3:12a —这不是说我已经得着了，已经完全了，

D. No matter how hard believers try to live a perfect life, they still sin while living in this world. Believers must wait until heaven to become perfect.

无论信徒多么努力过完全的生活，他们在这世上的生活仍旧犯罪。信徒必须等待，直到进了天国，才算完全。

<br>

Romans 7:21-23, 18-19, 24-25 – 21 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22For in my inner being I delight in God's law; 23but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!  So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.

罗马书 7:21-23, 18-19, 24-25 —21我觉得有个律，就是我愿意为善的时候，便有恶与我同在。 22因为按着我里面的意思（原文作”人“），我是喜欢神的律； 23但我觉得肢体中另有个律和我心中的律交战，把我掳去，叫我附从那肢体中犯罪的律。

18我也知道在我里头，就是我肉体之中，没有良善。因为立志为善由得我，只是行出来由不得我。 19故此，我所愿意的善，我反不做；我所不愿意的恶，我倒去做。

24我真是苦啊！谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢？25感谢　神！靠着我们的主耶稣基督就能脱离了。这样看来，我以内心顺服神的律，我肉体却顺服罪的律了。

E. Christians sin in weakness. Their sinful natures still afflict them and lead them into sins against God. As this goes on, the believing natures of Christians are objecting to and opposing these sins, are sorry for them and trusting in Christ for forgiveness for them.

基督徒因为软弱犯罪。他们的罪性仍旧折磨他们，引诱他们犯罪，与神为敌。同时，基督徒信的特性反对和抵制这些罪，为罪懊悔，相信基督已经赦免了他们的罪。

<br>

Romans 8:1 – Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

罗马书 8:1 —如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。

F. God does not ignore or excuse sins of weakness, but He does forgive them. Christians are continually pardoned for their sins of weakness since they remain trusting in Jesus as their Savior. Jesus grants forgiveness as part of the relationship He has with believers. Christians are at one and the same time both sinners and those who have the forgiveness of sins （saints）。

神不会忽视罪或者以人的软弱为理由，为罪找借口，但是神却确确实实赦免了人的罪。因为基督徒一直相信耶稣是救主，他们由于软弱犯的罪不断被赦免。耶稣承认，宽恕是神和信徒关系中的一部分。基督徒一方面是罪人，另一方面获得了宽恕（成为圣徒）。

Ephesians 2:8-9 – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书2:8，9 — 8你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的； 9也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

E. HYMN / PRAYER 赞美诗/祷告

Hymn 184: 1, 3 in Christian Worship: ”O Holy Spirit, Enter In“

O Holy Spirit, enter in And in our hearts Your Work begin,

Your dwelling place now make us. Sun of the Soul , O Light divine,

Around and in us brightly shine, To joy and gladness wake us

That we May be Truly living, To You giving Prayer unceasing

And in love be still increasing.

O mighty Rock, O Source of life, Let your dear Word, in doubt and strife,

In us be strongly burning That we be faithful unto death

And live in love and holy faith, From You true wisdom learning.

Your grace and peace On us shower; By your power Christ confessing,

Let us see our Savior's blessing.
