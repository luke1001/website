### II. A Matter of Life and Death  一件有关生死的大事

A. God tells us that our relationship with Him is both an urgent and an important matter of life and death.

神告诉我们，我们与他的关系是一件有关生死、紧要急迫的大事。

Deuteronomy 30:19-20 – This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God, listen to His voice, and hold fast to Him. For the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years in the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

申30:19-20 – 19我今日呼天唤地向你作见证;我将生死、祸福陈明在你面前,所以你要拣选生命,使你和你的后裔都得存活;20且爱耶和华你的　神,听从他的话,专靠他,因为他是你的生命,你的日子长久也在乎他.这样,你就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许所赐的地上居住.

John 17:3 – Now this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.

约17:3 –认识你独一的真神,并且认识你所差来的耶稣基督,这就是永生.

1. God tells us that true life is more than mere physical existence. He insists that life is being in a close, trusting, loving relationship with Him; knowing Him in a personal, intimate way through Jesus Christ.

    神告诉我们，真正的生命不仅仅是身体的存在；他强调，生命是与他之间亲密、信任和慈爱的关系；通过耶稣基督认识他，并与他建立一个私人的亲密关系。

2. This definition of life prompts us to ask some intriguing questions:

    生命的这个定义让我们思考一些发人深省的问题：

    a） What is my relationship with God? Am I dead to Him or alive in Him?

    我和神之间的关系怎样？我在他面前是死的，还是活在他里面？

    b） Does it make a difference whether I am spiritually dead or alive?

    我的属灵生命的死与活有什么不同吗？

    c） If I'm spiritually dead, what can be done about it? How can I become spiritually alive?

    如果我的属灵生命是死的，我应该怎么办？我怎样才能让我的属灵生命活过来？

B. Our sin has ruined our relationship with God.

我们的罪破坏了我们与神的关系

Job 14:1-2, 14a – Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble. He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure. If a man dies, will he live again?

伯14:1-2, 14a –1人为妇人所生,日子短少,多有患难;2出来如花,又被割下,飞去如影,不能存留.14a人若死了，岂能再活呢?

1. The troubles of life, the reality of death and the uncertainties of eternity lead us to recognize that things have gone terribly wrong with life in this world and to wonder why this is so.

    生活中的烦恼，死亡的真实，以及对永恒的不确定，都让我们认识到：人在这个世界上的生命出了很大问题；人也禁不住发问：人为 什么会这样？

    Leviticus 19:2b – Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy.

    未19:2下 –你晓谕以色列全会众说:你们要圣洁,因为我耶和华你们的　神是圣洁的.

    Leviticus 18:4-5 – You must obey My laws and be careful to follow My decrees. I am the Lord your God. Keep My decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the Lord.

    未18:4-5 – 4你们要遵我的典章,守我的律例,按此而行.我是耶和华你们的　神.5所以你们要守我的律例、典章.人若遵行,就必因此活着.我是耶和华.

2. God requires that people live a perfect life of obedience to all God's commands in order to have life with Him.

    神要求，人必须活出完美、顺服神所有命令的生活，才能与他同在。

    Ezekiel 18:4 – For every living soul belongs to Me, the father as well as the son-both alike belong to Me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.

    结18:4 –看哪,世人都是属我的:为父的怎样属我,为子的也照样属我。犯罪的他必死亡.

    Romans 3:10, 23 – As it is written: ”There is no one righteous, not even one; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.“

    罗3:10, 23 –10就如经上所记:没有义人,连一个也没有.23因为世人都犯了罪,亏缺了神的荣耀;

    Isaiah 59:2a – But your iniquities have separated you from your God.

    赛59:2上 –2但你们的罪孽使你们与　神隔绝;

    Romans 6:23a – For the wages of sin is death.

    罗6:23上—因为罪的工价乃是死;

3. All people （including us） have failed to live a perfect life of loving obedience to God. Our sins have separated us from God and have destroyed us spiritually. Because of our sins, we have lost life with God. Because of our unloving defiance and disobedience toward God, we deserve to experience His fierce wrath and eternal punishment.

    所有人（包括我们自己）都没有活出神要求的爱与顺服的完美生命。我们的罪毁掉了我们的属灵生命，并且让我们与神隔离。因为罪，我们失去了神的同在；因为我们不爱神，与他对抗，不顺服他，就只配承受他的愤怒和永恒的刑罚。

C. Because of His amazing love, God worked to restore us to life with Him

因为神对人的奇异大爱，他亲自做工，恢复我们与他同在的生活。

Ephesians 2:4-5a – But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions.

弗2:4-5上 – 4然而,神既有丰富的怜悯,因他爱我们的大爱,5当我们死在过犯中的时候,便叫我们与基督一同活过来.

John 3:17 – For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.

约3:17 –因为神差他的儿子降世,不是要定世人的罪（或作:审判世人;下同）,乃是要叫世人因他得救.

1. Out of His great love for undeserving, helpless sinners, God sent His Son, Jesus, to save us from eternal death and to regain eternal life for us.

    因为他对不配又无助的罪人所怀的大爱，神便差遣他的儿子耶稣，来拯救我们，把我们从永远的死亡中救出来，使我们重新获得永恒的生命。

    2 Corinthians 5:21 – God made Him （Jesus） who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

    林后5:21 –神使那无罪（无罪:原文是不知罪）的,替我们成为罪,好叫我们在他里面成为神的义.

2. Jesus came to be our Substitute before God. He came to give us His perfect keeping of God's commands. He came to take our sin and its punishment on Himself.

    耶稣的到来，是要在神面前作我们的替代品；他的到来，是要把他遵守了神所有命令的完美生命赐给我们；他的到来，是要把我们的罪以及所有罪的刑罚都担在他自己身上。

    Romans 5:18, 19b – The result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men… Through the obedience of the one man （Jesus） the many will be made righteous.

    罗5:18, 19下 –18如此说来,因一次的过犯,众人都被定罪;照样,因一次的义行,众人也就被称义得生命了.19因一人的悖逆,众人成为罪人;照样,因一人（耶稣）的顺从,众人也成为义了.

3. Jesus lived a holy life in our place.

    耶稣代替我们活出了圣洁的生命。

    Hebrews 7:27b – He （Jesus） sacrificed for their sins once for all when He offered himself.

    来7:27 下---他不像那些大祭司,每日必须先为自己的罪,后为百姓的罪献祭;因为他只一次将自己献上,就把这事成全了.

    1 John 2:2 – He （Jesus） is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.

    约一2:2---他（耶稣） 为我们的罪作了挽回祭,不是单为我们的罪,也是为普天下人的罪.

    1 John 1:7b – The blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin.

    约一1:7下—他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪.

4. Jesus suffered and died in our place to pay the full penalty of sins.

    耶稣代替我们受难、死亡，清除了罪的全部惩罚。

    1 Corinthians 15:20a – But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead.

    林前15:20上---但基督已经从死里复活,....

    John 11:25 – Jesus said to her, ”I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies.“

    约11:25---耶稣对他说:”复活在我,生命也在我.信我的人虽然死了,也必复活,“

5. Jesus rose from the dead and assured us that He has won eternal life for us.

    耶稣的复活让我们确知，他已经为我们赢得了永恒的生命。

D. God gives eternal life for us.

神把永恒的生命赐给我们

Acts 16:30-31a – He （The jailer） then brought them out and asked, ”Sirs, what must I do to be saved?“ They replied, ”Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.“

徒16:30-31上— 30又领他们出来,说:”二位先生,我当怎样行才可以得救?“31他们说:”当信主耶稣,你和你一家都必得救.“

Ephesians 2:8-9 – For it is by grace you have been saved through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast.

弗2:8-9—8你们得救是本乎恩,也因着信;这并不是出于自己,乃是神所赐的;9也不是出于行为,免得有人自夸.

1. God gives eternal life to us as a pure, undeserved gift which we receive freely from Him through believing in Jesus as our Savior from our sins.

    神赐给我们的永恒生命，是一个我们不配得到的纯洁礼物。我们通过相信耶稣，让他作我们的救主，把我们从罪恶之中救赎出来，我们就白白得到了这份礼物。

    Ezekiel 18:23, 32b – Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? . . . Repent and live!

    结18:23, 32下 –23主耶和华说:恶人死亡,岂是我喜悦的吗?不是喜悦他回头离开所行的道存活吗?32主耶和华说:我不喜悦那死人之死,所以你们当回头而存活.

    John 3:36 – Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.

    约3:36--信子的人有永生;不信子的人得不着永生（原文作不得见永生）,神的震怒常在他身上.」

2. God lovingly invites us to receive His precious gift of eternal life in Christ. This is a gift we cannot afford to refuse.

    神把永生的宝贵礼物赐给我们，并慈爱地邀请我们通过相信耶稣来接受这份礼物。人如果拒绝这份礼物，后果无法承担。

### III. The Two Sources of Our Knowledge About God 我们认识神的两个途径

A. The two sources: 两个途径

1. From natural knowledge （ourselves; from our world）

    从自然界（我们自己和周围的世界）认识神

2. From God's fuller revelation of Himself

    从神自己的全备启示认识神

B. Our natural knowledge of God 我们从自然界认识神

Psalm 19:1 – The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.

诗19:1 –（大卫的诗,交与伶长.）诸天述说神的荣耀;穹苍传扬他的手段.

Hebrews 3:4 – For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.

来3:4 –因为房屋都必有人建造,但建造万物的就是神.

Romans 2:15 – Since they （people with no contact with the Bible） show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.

罗2:15 –这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里,他们（没有接触过圣经的人）是非之心同作见证,并且他们的思念互相较量,或以为是,或以为非.）

1. The miraculous way that nature, the world, and the universe work show us that God exists and that He made us and preserves us.

    自然、世界以及宇宙的奇妙运行方式，向我们显明神的存在；而且他不仅造了我们，还在保守我们。

2. Our reason and conscience with its understanding of right and wrong also tell us there is a God and give us some information as to what God is like （E.g., that He is wise, powerful, good, just）。

    我们能判断正误的理性和良心也在告诉我们有一位神；理性和良心还让我们认识了神的形像（比如，他是智慧的神，有能力、良善和公义） .

    Psalm 14:1 – The fool says in his heart: ”There is no God.“

    诗14:1— 愚顽人心里说：”没有神。“

3. Only fools （atheists – who insist there is no God, and agnostics – who question whether God can be known） dare to defy and deny the testimony of nature and their own reason and conscience.

    只有愚昧人（无神论者—他们坚持说没有神，和不可知论者—他们对神是否可以被人认知持怀疑态度）敢藐视并否认大自然以及他们自己的理性和良心所做的见证。

    Acts 17:24-27 – The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And He is not served by human hands, as if He needed anything, because He Himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. From one man He made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and He determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did this so that men would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.

    徒17:24-27 – 24创造宇宙和其中万物的神,既是天地的主,就不住人手所造的殿,25也不用人手服事,好像缺少什么;自己倒将生命、气息、万物,赐给万人.26他从一本（有古卷作血脉）造出万族的人,住在全地上,并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界,27要叫他们寻求神,或者可以揣摩而得,其实他离我们各人不远;

4. God gives us a natural knowledge of Himself to lead us to seek to know Him better in order to gain a right relationship with Him.

    神把有关他的自然知识赐给我们，引导我们更好地寻求认识他，与他建立正确的关系。

5. Our natural knowledge of God is a useful witness to God's existence, but it is of rather limited help to us. It gives us a vital starting point. However, it is not able to give us a saving knowledge of God. Sin has corrupted human thinking, distorted our view of God and now bars the way to people being saved through their own efforts to follow their inborn knowledge of God's will. Without God's deliverance from this corruption, no escape is possible. People only ruin themselves under the power of sin.

    自然知识是我们认识神存在的有用见证，但它对我们的帮助还相当有限。自然知识给了我们一个关键的起点，但却不能让我们认识到神的拯救。罪已经损坏了人的思维，扭曲了我们对神的看法，而且正在做阻挡的工作，使人不能通过自己的努力，凭借自身对神旨意的知识而得救。没有神的亲自救助，人就无法脱离这种败坏，也没有可能逃脱，只能在罪的权势下日渐消灭。

    Romans 1:18-32 – The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.  24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.  25 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.  27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.  28 Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, He gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.  29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

    罗1:18-32 –18原来,神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上,就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人.19神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里,因为神已经给他们显明.20自从造天地以来,神的永能和神性是明明可知的,虽是眼不能见,但藉着所造之物就可以晓得,叫人无可推诿。21因为,他们虽然知道神,却不当作神荣耀他,也不感谢他.他们的思念变为虚妄,无知的心就昏暗了.22自称为聪明,反成了愚拙;23将不能朽坏之神的荣耀变为偶像,仿佛必朽坏的人和飞禽、走兽、昆虫的样式.24所以,神任凭他们逞着心里的情欲行污秽的事,以致彼此玷辱自己的身体.25他们将神的真实变为虚谎,去敬拜事奉受造之物,不敬奉那造物的主;主乃是可称颂的,直到永远.阿们!26因此,神任凭他们放纵可羞耻的情欲.他们的女人把顺性的用处变为逆性的用处;27男人也是如此,弃了女人顺性的用处,欲火攻心,彼此贪恋,男和男行可羞耻的事,就在自己身上受这妄为当得的报应.28他们既然故意不认识神,神就任凭他们存邪僻的心,行那些不合理的事;29装满了各样不义、邪恶、贪婪、恶毒（或作:阴毒）,满心是嫉妒、凶杀、争竞、诡诈、毒恨;30又是谗毁的、背后说人的、怨恨神的（或作:被神所憎恶的）、侮慢人的、狂傲的、自夸的、捏造恶事的、违背父母的.31无知的,背约的,无亲情的,不怜悯人的.32他们虽知道神判定行这样事的人是当死的,然而他们不但自己去行,还喜欢别人去行.

    a. Sinful people deny the truth about God that they know from nature and put themselves under God's punishing wrath （Romans 1:18-20, above）。

    罪人藐视大自然映射出的对神的知识，以致让自己处在神的审判和愤怒之下（上面的罗马书1:18-20）

    b. People reject God's self-revelation in nature and tangle themselves in idolatry, the worship of false gods. （Romans 1:21-23, above）。 Everyone really has some kind of god that they look to for the highest good in life. Under the control of sin, people end up worshipping their self-made/self-chosen god rather than the true God （e.g., idols, money, self, power）。

    人不接受神通过大自然对自己的启示，却让自己和偶像纠缠在一起去拜假神（以上罗1:21-23）。每个人都在心里自己造了一个神，期望能让他们一生得到最大的好处。人在罪的控制下，最终开始崇拜自己造的或挑选的神（如偶像，金钱，自我，权利等），而不去敬拜独一的真神。

    c. God responds to this rejection of Him by sinful people with His condemning judgment. He sentences them to be enslaved by their sinful desires and dominated by selfish drives. Abandoned by their Creator, they plunged themselves deeper in sin and eternal doom. （Romans 1:24-32, above）。

    面对罪人对他的拒绝，神以定罪和审判回应他们。他向他们宣判，让他们被自己的罪欲奴役，被自己的私欲控制。结果，他们被自己的创造主丢弃，陷入更深的罪和永远的灭亡中。（以上罗1:24-32）

C. The revealed knowledge of God

神揭示的知识

1. God must give us more a complete knowledge of Himself, if we are to truly know Him and gain eternal life.

    要真正认识神并得着永生，人就必须得着神启示自己的完整知识。

    Psalm 119:105 – Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.

    诗119:105 –你的话是我脚前的灯,是我路上的光.

    John 6:68 – Simon Peter answered Him: ”Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.“

    约6:68 –西门彼得回答说:”主啊,你有永生之道,我们还归从谁呢?“

    2 Timothy 3:15 - 15 And how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

    提后3:15 -并且知道你是从小明白圣经.这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧.

2. God has given us a fuller revelation of Himself in the Bible. The Bible, God's Word, is our reliable guide to a saving relationship with God.

    神在圣经中已经把有关他的较完整的启示赐给我们。神的话——圣经，是我们可信赖的向导，指引我们建立与神之间的救赎关系。

### IV. The Bible 圣经

A. The Bible is God's Word to people. 圣经是神向人说的话

1 Thessalonians 2:13 – And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.

帖前2:13-为此,我们也不住的感谢神,因你们听见我们所传神的道就领受了;不以为是人的道,乃以为是神的道.这道实在是神的,并且运行在你们信主的人心中.

2 Peter 1:21 – For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

彼后1:21—因为预言从来没有出于人意的,乃是人被圣灵感动,说出神的话来.

2 Timothy 3:16a – All Scripture is God-breathed.

提后3:16上—圣经都是神所默示的（或作:凡神所默示的圣经）,

1. Although the Bible had human writers, it has a divine Author. It is a God-given, not a human-made book. God gave the writers every thought and word He wanted them to record. We call the process by which the Holy Spirit gave each word of the Bible to its writers as ”verbal inspiration“.

    尽管圣经是人写的，但它的真正作者是神。圣经是神赐给人的，不是人的创作。神把他要人知道的每一个想法和每一句话都传达给圣经的作者，并要他们记录下来。我们把圣灵将圣经的每个字传达给作者的过程，称为”默示“.

    John 10:35 – The Scripture cannot be broken.

    约10:35—经上的话是不能废的;

    John 17:17 – Sanctify them by the truth, Your word is truth.

    约17:17 —求你用真理使他们成圣;你的道就是真理.

    Luke 24:44 – Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.

    路24:44—耶稣对他们说:”这就是我从前与你们同在之时所告诉你们的话说:摩西的律法、先知的书,和诗篇上所记的,凡指着我的话都必须应验.“

2. Every word of the Bible is absolutely true. The Scriptures are without error in any way. To find ”mistakes“ and ”contradictions“ in the Scriptures is to not allow the Bible to speak for itself.

    圣经中的每个字都绝对真实的，圣经在任何方面都没有错误。要在圣经中找”错误“和”矛盾“,就是不让圣经为自己说话。

    2 Timothy 3:14-17 – But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,  15 and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.  16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

    提后3:14-17 –14但你所学习的、所确信的,要存在心里,因为你知道是跟谁学的.15并且知道你是从小明白圣经,这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧.16圣经都是神所默示的（或作:凡神所默示的圣经）,于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的,17叫属神的人得以完全,预备行各样的善事.

3. The Bible is also sufficient to teach us all we need to know to be saved, to grow in faith, and to be prepared to live our life in service to God.

    圣经在教导我们所需要的所有知识上也是充足的，如得救、信心的成长、预备过服侍神的生活等方面都是充足的。

    John 7:17 – If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether My teachings come from God or whether I speak on My own.

    约7:17—人若立志遵着他的旨意行,就必晓得这教训或是出于神,或是我凭着自己说的.

    Hebrews 4:12 – For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

    来4:12—神的道是活泼的,是有功效的,比一切两刃的剑更快,甚至魂与灵,骨节与骨髓,都能刺入、剖开,连心中的思念和主意都能辨明.

4. Some object and say: ”Prove to me that the Bible is God's Word.“ While no one can do this, the Bible itself has the power to convince people that it is the true word of God. As people expose themselves to the Bible's message, God works through that message to persuade them of its truth. God invites us to try the Bible for ourselves and receive it's blessings.

    有些人反对说：”你怎么能证明圣经是神的话呢？“虽然没有人能证明，但圣经自己有能力说服这些人相信：圣经就是神的真实话语。当人接触圣经的信息时，神就透过那些信息做工，让他们相信它的真实性。神邀请我们亲自去检验圣经，并接受圣经的祝福。

B. The contents of the Bible 圣经的内容

1. The Bible is made up of 66 books. It is written by about 40 men over a 1,500-year time period.

    圣经由66卷书组成，大约有四十位作者在1500多年间写成。

2. The Old Testament is made up of the first 39 books. It was written in Hebrew and Aramaic by Moses and the prophets from about 1,400 to 400 B.C.

    旧约有39卷书，作者是摩西和先知，写作语言是希伯来文和亚兰文；写作时间大约在公元前1400年—公元前400年。

3. The New Testament included the final 27 books of the Bible. It was written in Greek by the evangelists （gospel writers） and the apostles from about 50 to 100 A.D.

    新约圣经包括最后27卷书，是宣教士（福音书的作者）和使徒所写，使用语言是希腊语，时间大约在公元50—100年间。

    John 20:31 – These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.

    约20:31— 但记这些事，要叫你们信耶稣是基督,是神的儿子,并且叫你们信了他,就可以因他的名得生命.

4. The central theme of the Bible is Jesus Christ and what He has done to deliver us from sin and death. Its purpose is to introduce us to Christ as our Savior and to give us eternal life. Martin Luther once said: ”The entire Scripture is throughout nothing but Jesus Christ, God's and Mary's Son, all has to do with this Son, that we might know Him.“

    圣经的中心主题是耶稣基督，以及他为救赎我们脱离罪和死所做的一切；目的是要向我们介绍，基督就是那位赐我们永生的救主。马丁路德曾说：”整本圣经贯穿的就是耶稣基督——神的儿子，也是马利亚的儿子，以及和这个儿子相关的所有事情，使我们可以认识他。“

C. Understanding the Bible 理解圣经

1. Two questions highlight the challenge:

    两个具有挑战性的问题

    a. If all Christian churches use the same Bible, why are there so many denominations with such different teachings?

    如果所有的教会都在使用同一本圣经，为什么还会出现那么多教导不同内容的宗派？

    b. How does a person really know what the Bible says? Who is to say that one person's understanding is better than another's?

    人怎样才能知道圣经在说什么呢？谁来裁判一种解释比另一种解释更好？

2. Misusing the Bible 误用圣经

    Revelation 22:18-19 – I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.  19 And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

    启22:18-19 –18我向一切听见这书上预言的作见证,若有人在这预言上加添什么,神必将写在这书上的灾祸加在他身上;19这书上的预言,若有人删去什么,神必从这书上所写的生命树和圣城删去他的分.

    a. Some people sinfully tamper with the Scriptures, either adding to or subtracting from the Word of God.

    篡改圣经的人要么在神的话语中添加，要么删减，他们罪孽深重。

    2 Peter 3:16 - 16 He （Paul） writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.

    彼后3:16 –他（保罗）一切的信上也都是讲论这事.信中有些难明白的,那无学问、不坚固的人强解,如强解别的经书一样,就自取沉沦.

    2 Corinthians 10:5 – We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.  

    林后10:5 –将各样的计谋,各样拦阻人认识神的那些自高之事,一概攻破了,又将人所有的心意夺回,使他都顺服基督.

    b. Some people incorrectly use their reason to distort Scripture. You must use your reason to understand the Bible, but you dare not let human reason sit in judgment over the Bible （e.g., historical-critical methodology）。

    有人用他们的理性扭曲圣经，这是不对的。你必须使用理性来理解圣经，但却不能让理性高于圣经来做判断（比如，历史批判解经法）

    2 Peter 2:1-3 – But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves.   Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.   In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.

    彼后2:1-3 –1从前在百姓中有假先知起来,将来在你们中间也必有假师傅,私自引进陷害人的异端,连买他们的主他们也不承认,自取速速的灭亡.2将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为,便叫真道因他们的缘故被毁谤.3他们因有贪心,要用捏造的言语在你们身上取利.他们的刑罚,自古以来并不迟延;他们的灭亡也必速速来到（原文是不打盹） .

    c. People who misuse Scripture do so for selfish reasons. They bring great spiritual harm to themselves and those they influence.

    人之所以误用圣经，完全是出于自私的目的。他们给自己和被他们影响的人，在灵里造成了极大的损害。

3. Understanding the Bible properly. Basic principle: The Bible helps explain itself.

    正确理解圣经。基本原则：以经解经（让圣经自己解释自己）

    a. There are two key teachings God gives us in the Bible to understand His Word properly: LAW and GOSPEL

    神在圣经中赐给我们两大教导——律法与福音，来帮助我们正确理解他的话语。

    b. These two major teachings of the Bible differ in five important ways:

    圣经的两大教导有五个重要内容：

    |          LAW          |                |                 GOSPEL                 |
    |:---------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
    |          律法         |                |                  福音                  |
    |  God's Moral Demands  | （Definition） | Gift/Talent God's Saving Work In Jesus |
    |      神的道德要求     |    （定义）    |          神在耶稣里的拯救工作          |
    | People Must Do Things |   （Example）  |    God Does Things For Us John 3:16    |
    |      人必须做的事     |    （举例）    |          神为我们做的事 约3:16         |
    |    Demands, Threats   |     (Form)     |          Promises, Assurances          |
    |       命令、威胁      |    （形式）    |               应许，确据               |
    |  Works,Sorrow, Guides |    (Effects)   |     Saves, Gives life, Strengthens     |
    |   行为 , 痛苦， 指导  |    （结果）    |          拯救，赐予生命，坚固          |
    |     Secure in Sin     |  (Application) |             Alarmed by Sin             |
    |      安心犯罪的人     |    （应用）    |              被罪震惊的人              |


D. The Bible explains itself 圣经自己解释自己

1. Take the Bible on its own terms. Accept the claims it makes for itself until it proves otherwise. Don't approach the Bible with a bias to distort its meaning.

    根据圣经的原话来理解圣经，接纳它为自己做出的宣告，除非你看到相反的证据。不要带着偏见理解圣经，以免扭曲它的意思。

2. Read it as you would any other piece of literature: respect the meaning of is words, its grammar and style.

    把它当成一部文学作品来读，就像你读其它任何文学作品一样；尊重作品的语言、语法以及透过风格所表达的意义。

3. Use clear, easily understood passages to help explain the unclear passages

    用清楚易懂的部分来帮助理解不易懂的部分。

4. Note how the passages from Colossians and Ephesians below help us understand the term ”image of God“ from Genesis:

    查看下面歌罗西和以弗所书中的经文，看它们是怎样帮助解释创世记中”神的形像“一词。

    Genesis 1:27 – So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

    创1:27——神就照着自己的形像造人,乃是照着他的形像造男造女.

    Colossians 3:10 – and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.

    西3:10——穿上了新人.这新人在知识上渐渐更新,正如造他主的形像.

    Ephesians 4:24 – and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

    弗4:24——并且穿上新人;这新人是照着神的形像造的,有真理的仁义和圣洁.

E. Bible translations 圣经翻译

1. We read a translated Bible. The Bible has been translated into many languages

    我们读的圣经是圣经的翻译本。圣经已被翻译成很多种语言。

2. We need translations because of limitations in learning Greek and Hebrew and because language changes.

    受希腊文和希伯来文的局限，也因为语言自身在不断变化，我们需要翻译。

    a. Translation is difficult work. A biblical Hebrew or Greek word or expression may not have an equivalent word or phrase in another language.

    翻译是很艰难的工作。圣经中的一个希伯来或希腊字或词，在另一种语言中可能不会有相对应的字或词。

    b. Language changes constantly. Words are always changing in meaning in actively used languages

    语言在不断变化，在使用频繁的语言中，词语的意义一直在发生改变。

3. We have a very accurate Hebrew and Greek text. It has been well preserved through the ages. Most translations are reliable, unless the text has been deliberately altered.

    我们有一个非常精确的希伯来和希腊文本，历年来一直保存完好。圣经的多数译本都是可信赖的，除非有人故意篡改。

### V: Conclusion: To get the greatest benefit from these studies there are two things we strongly urge you to do. 结论：为了能从这个学习中获得最大的收益，我们强烈要求你做两件事情：
