复习第十课家庭作业中的问题

### I. Love For Others 爱人

John 13:34 – “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

约翰福音13:34 -“我赐给你们一条新命令，乃是叫你们彼此相爱；我怎样爱你们，你们也要怎样相爱。”

Romans 13:8-9 – Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. The commandments, ”Do not commit adultery,“ ”Do not murder,“ ”Do not steal,“ ”Do not covet,“ and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one rule: ”Love your neighbor as yourself.“

罗马书13:8-9 ——8凡事都不可亏欠人，惟有彼此相爱，要常以为亏欠，因为爱人的就完全了律法。9像那”不可奸淫“,”不可杀人“”不可偷盗“,”不可贪婪“,或有别的诫命，都包在”爱人如己“这一句话之内了。

    他想要我们像我们爱自己一样自然地继续爱别人。

约翰一书4:19-21 ——19我们爱，因为神先爱我们。20人若说”我爱神“,却恨他的弟兄，就是说谎话的；不爱他所看见的弟兄，就不能爱没有看见的神。20爱神的，也当爱弟兄，这是我们从神所受的命令

B. God considers love for others to be an integral part of our love for Him.

上帝认为爱他人是我们对他的爱中不可分割的一部分。

1. We cannot love God while hating the people God places close to us and who need our help.

    我们不能在爱神的同时恨他人，就是那些神放在我们旁边，需要我们帮助的人。

But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.

罗马书13:1-2,4 -

1在上有权柄的，人人当顺服他，因为没有权柄不是出于神的，凡掌权的都是神所命的。2所以抗拒掌权的，就是抗拒神的命；抗拒的必自取刑罚。

This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

    罗马书13:5-7 ——5所以你们必须顺服，不但是因为刑罚，也是因为良心。6你们纳粮也是为这个缘故，因他们是神的差役，常常特管这事。7凡人所当得的，就给他；当得粮的，给他纳粮；当得税的，给他上税；当惧怕的，惧怕他；当恭敬的，恭敬他。

Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?“ Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, ”O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and He will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.“ Then Nebuchadnezzar said, ”Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in Him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.

    但以理书3:15b-18,28 -

    15b若俯伏敬拜我们所造的像，却还可以；若不敬拜，必立时扔在烈火的窑中！有何神能救你们脱离我手呢？16沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌回答王说：“尼布甲尼撒啊！这件事我们无需回答你。17如果我们被扔在火窑里，我们所事奉的　神必能拯救我们；王啊！他必拯救我们脱离烈火的窑和你的手。（本节或译：”如果我们所事奉的　神能拯救我们，王啊！他必拯救我们脱离烈火的窑和你的手。“）18即或不然，王啊！你要知道，我们决不事奉你的神，也不向你所立的金像下拜。”三人在烈火的窑中毫无损伤。

    28尼布甲尼撒说：“沙得拉、米煞、亚伯尼歌的　神是应当称颂的，他差遣使者拯救那些倚靠他的仆人；他们违抗王的命令，宁愿舍命，除了自己的　神以外，不肯事奉敬拜任何其他的神。

    故意结束婴儿的生命是自私的、不负责任的对无辜的生命的屠杀。

    c. The abortion of an unborn child who is unwanted or malformed or the product of rape, incest or one mentally incompetent is based on the faulty idea that a person's life and worth is to be measured, not by its God-given sanctity, but by a subjective human ethic of quality or usefulness.

    因为不想要孩子，或者因为孩子是畸形，或者因为孩子是强奸、乱伦的产物，或是精神无能者所怀的孩子，而选择堕胎的行为是基于用人类主观伦理或用处，而非神赐的圣洁来衡量人的生命和价值的错误认识。

    d. God calls on believers to protect the lives of the unborn and others who are weak and not able to defend themselves.

    上帝呼召信徒保护未出生的生命和其他软弱、无法自我保护的生命。

    e. Taking the life of an unborn child if the mother would lose her life by giving birth is another matter. A prayerful choice of which life to save may have to be made and would not violate the Fifth Commandment's principle of not willfully or needlessly taking another person's life.

    如果不堕胎，母亲就会有生命危险，这是另一种情形。如果必须要作出选择来决定拯救哪个生命，这样也不会违背第五条诫命的规定，因为这是不属于有意或不必要地夺走其他人的生命。

    Proverbs 6:16b, 17b – The Lord hates . . . hands that shed innocent blood.

    b. To induce or hasten a person's death is to put oneself in God's place as the one who determines the end of life.

    诱导或加速一个人的死亡是把自己放在了神的位置上，认为自己可以决定生命的结束。

    c. Permitting a person to die naturally when further medication and procedures would only prolong life a short time or artificially is another matter. In situations like this, a Christian may choose to let a condition take its natural course without further treatment. Such a choice would not violate the Fifth Commandment.

    在进一步医药和治疗过程只能人为短暂延长生命的情况下，允许一个人自然死亡是另一种情形了。在这种情形下，一个基督徒可能会选择停止治疗好让其自然死亡。这种选择没有违背第五条诫命。

    Romans 13:10a – Love does no harm to its neighbor.

5.  God forbids us to physically or mentally hurt, shorten or add misery to the life of another person or ourselves. Examples of such harm would be:

    Ephesians 4:26 – In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,

    以弗所书4:26 -生气却不要犯罪。不可含怒到日落。

    Romans 12:19 – Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ”It is mine to avenge; I will repay,“ says the Lord.

    罗马书12:19 -亲爱的弟兄，不要自己伸冤，宁可让步，听凭主怒。（或作让人发怒）因为经上记着，主说，伸冤在我。我必报应。

1 John 3:16-18 – This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.

约翰一书3:16-18 ——16主为我们舍命，我们从此就知道何为爱。我们也应当为弟兄舍命。17凡有世上财物的，看见弟兄穷乏，却塞住怜恤的心，爱神的心怎能存在他里面呢。18小子们哪，我们相爱，不要只在言语和舌头上。总要在行为和诚实上。

Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man.

箴言31:10,28-30 —

10才德的妇人，谁能得着呢，她的价值胜过珍珠。

28他的儿女起来称他有福。他的丈夫也称赞他，29说，才德的女子很多，惟独你超过一切。30艳丽是虚假的。美容是虚浮的。惟敬畏耶和华的妇女，必得称赞

    彼得前书3:1-2 ——1你们作妻子的，要顺服自己的丈夫。这样，若有不信从道理的丈夫，他们虽然不听道，也可以因妻子的品行被感化过来。2这是因为看见你们有贞洁的品行，和敬畏的心。

6. If a Christian has an unbelieving spouse, God wants the believer to live in a godly way in marriage in hopes that the unbeliever will be led to faith in Christ.

1 Corinthians 7:39 – A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.

哥林多前书7:39 -丈夫活着的时候，妻子是被约束的。丈夫若死了，妻子就可以自由，随意再嫁。只是要嫁这在主里面的人。

    有过错而导致离婚的一方唯有在悔改之后才能再婚。

    Mark 10:11-12 – He answered, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”

    马可福音10:11-12 ——11耶稣对他们说，凡休妻另娶的，就是犯奸淫，辜负他的妻子。12妻子若离弃丈夫另嫁，也是犯奸淫了。

3. A guilty party in a divorce who remarries without repenting is living in an adulterous union contrary to God's will.

    离婚中有过错的一方如果不悔改就再婚，就是违反了上帝的旨意，犯了奸淫。

1 Thessalonians 4:3-6a – It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him.

帖撒罗尼迦前书4:3-6a ——3神的旨意就是要你们成为圣洁，远避淫行。4要你们各人晓得怎样用圣洁尊贵，守着自己的身体。5不放纵私欲的邪情，像那不认识神的外邦人。6不要一个人在这事上越分，欺负他的弟兄。

1 Corinthians 6:13b, 19-20 – The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.

哥林多前书6:13b,19-20 -

13身子不是为淫乱，乃是为主。主也是为身子。

19岂不知你们的身子就是圣灵的殿麽。这圣灵是从神而来，住在你们里头的。并且你们不是自己的人。20因为你们是重价买来的。所以要在你们的身子荣耀神。

K. May God lead us to treasure His gift of sexuality and to devote ourselves to living sexually pure, God-honoring lives.

愿神带领我们珍惜他赐下的性的礼物，使我们能够过一种在性上纯洁的、荣耀神的生活。
