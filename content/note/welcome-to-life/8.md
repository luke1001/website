### I. The Institution Of Holy Communion 圣餐的设立

Mark 14:22-24 – While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, “Take it; this is My body.” Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,” He said to them.

马可福音 14:22-24  ——22他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝了福，就擘开递给他们，说：“你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。” 23又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，他们都喝了。 24耶稣说：“这是我立约的血，为多人流出来的。

Luke 22:15-20 – And He （Jesus） said to them, ”I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.“ After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, ”Take this and divide it among you. For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.“ And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ”This is My body given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.“ In the same way, after the supper He took the cup, saying, ”This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.

路加福音 22:15-20 ——15耶稣对他们说：“我很愿意在受害以先和你们吃这逾越节的筵席。16我告诉你们：我不再吃这筵席，直到成就在　神的国里。” 17耶稣接过杯来，祝谢了，说：“你们拿这个，大家分着喝。18我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直等　神的国来到。”19又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开，递给他们，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。”20饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。

1 Corinthians 11:23-25 – For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, ”This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of mMe.“ In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, ”This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of Me.“

哥林多前书 11:23-25 ——23我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的，就是主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来， 24祝谢了，就掰开，说，这是我的身体，为你们舍的（舍有古卷作掰开）。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。25饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：”这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。“

A. Jesus instituted the Sacrament of Holy Communion on the night He was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, only hours before His death on the cross. This day is known as Maundy Thursday （the word ”Maundy“ is from the Latin and means ”to give a command“ referring very likely to the statement ”A new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you.“）。

耶稣在被犹大出卖的当天晚上，离十字架遇害仅仅几小时之前，设立了圣餐仪式。这一天被称为濯足节（”Maundy“ 来自于拉丁文，意思是命令吩咐，很可能指的是”我赐给你们一条新命令，乃是叫你们彼此相爱；我怎样爱你们，你们也要怎样相爱。“）

B. Jesus instituted Holy Communion at a Passover meal, eaten with His disciples in an upper room in Jerusalem.

耶稣在逾越节筵席上设立圣餐，耶稣与门徒在耶路撒冷的楼上的一个房间同吃。

1. Passover was the annual celebration of God's dramatic rescue of His people from slavery in Egypt.

    逾越节是每年一度的庆祝神把神的子民救出埃及的奴役的神奇作为的节日。

2. In the Passover meal, the celebrants reviewed the events of God's deliverance of His Old Testament people and praised God for His saving love.

    在逾越节里，参加庆祝的人回忆神拯救旧约百姓子民的事迹，赞美神救赎的大爱。

C. This Sacrament is known by several different names:

圣餐仪式有几种不同的名称。

1. Holy Communion stresses the holiness of the things joined together – Christ's Word and command. The communion is a ”union with“ or ”sharing“ of three things.

    圣餐礼强调圣洁的事物结合在一起-----基督的话语和命令。 ”communion“ 意思是融合或分享三种事物。

    a. A union of the bread and wine with the body and blood of Jesus.

    饼和酒与耶稣的身体和血融合。

    b. A union of the believing communicant with Christ.

    领受圣餐的信徒与基督融合。

    c. A union of all the believing communicants with each other through Jesus.

    所有领受圣餐的信徒通过基督彼此融合。

2. The Lord's Supper emphasizes that it is not just any meal

    主的晚餐强调这不是一般的晚餐。

    a. It was instituted and commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself.

    这是由我们主耶稣基督亲自设立和命令的。

    b. Jesus is our host at this heavenly meal and gives us His full, accepting fellowship and blessing.

    耶稣是这属天晚餐的主人，给我们满满的，领受的团体和祝福。

3. The Sacrament of the Altar is a name given by the Church to Holy Communion.

    圣餐的祭坛是教会称呼圣餐礼的名字。

    a. It stresses the location. Baptism is not done ”at the altar.“

    这个名字强调了地点。施洗并不是在”祭坛上“做的。

    b. The name conveys the insight that Holy Communion is intended only for Christians （people who can properly approach the Lord's altar）。

    这个名字传递了这样的知识----圣餐礼仅仅是为基督徒设立的（基督徒就是可以正当接近神的祭坛的人）

    c. Holy Communion is not intended to initiate faith, but to strengthen already existing faith.

    圣餐礼不是为了激发信心，而是为了加固已经有的信心。

### II. What Holy Communion Is 圣餐礼是什么

Matthew 26:26-29 –While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, ”Take and eat; this is My body.“ Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, ”Drink from it, all of you.  28 This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  29 I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father's kingdom.“

马太福音 26:26-29 ——26他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开递给门徒，说：”你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。“ 27又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：”你们都喝这个，28因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。29但我告诉你们：从今以后我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里同你们喝新的那日子。“

A. Holy Communion is Jesus' gift of His body and blood along with bread and wine for the forgiveness of sins, accomplished by the power of His Word.

圣餐礼是耶稣用自己的身体和宝血，连同饼和酒一起，给人的礼物，为的是赦免人的罪，通过神大能的话语完成。

1. According to Jesus' clear words, the person who eats the bread also receives Christ's body. And the person who drinks the wine also receives Christ's blood.

    根据耶稣的明确话语，吃饼的就会领受耶稣的身体，喝酒的就会领受耶稣的宝血。

2. We call the presence of Jesus' body and blood in the sacrament the ”real presence.“

    我们把圣餐礼中耶稣身体和宝血的临在称为”圣体实在“.

3. Communicants receive the bread and wine in a nature way. They receive Christ's body and blood in a supernatural way beyond our comprehension.

    领受圣餐的人以自然的方式领受饼和酒。但是他们以超过我们理解范围的超自然的方式领受耶稣基督的身体和宝血。

4. Jesus used unleavened bread （bread without yeast） and grape wine in instituting Holy Communion. While it is permissible to use leavened bread or grape juice in emergencies, we regularly use the same elements Jesus used.

    耶稣使用无酵饼（没有发酵的饼）和葡萄酒设立圣餐。虽然在紧急情况下我们可以使用发酵的饼或者葡萄汁，我们一般使用耶稣使用的材料。

B. The Biblical view compared with others.

圣经的教导和其他教导的比较。

1. The following chart compares the Bible's teaching of the real presence with two erring views that arose from distorting God's Word.

    如下的表格比较了圣经教导的圣体实在和曲解神话语的2个错误观点。

    | Nature 性质  | A Sacrament 圣餐礼   |  A Sacrifice 献祭  | A Symbol 象征 |
    | --------   | -----  | ----  | ----- |
    | Name 名称     | Real Presence 圣体实在 |           Transubstantiation 实体变换，体变（指面饼和葡萄酒经祝圣后变成基督的体血，只留下饼酒的外形）     | Representation 代表，象征 |
    | Key Words 关键词   |   “is My body, is My blood” “是我的身体，我的血”   |   “changes into” “变成”   |  “represents” “代表” |
    | Elements Present 出现的要素     |    Bread & Body 饼和身体；Wine & Blood 酒和血    |  No Bread & Wine   没有饼和酒；Christ’s entire being 基督的整个存在  | Bread & Wine 饼和酒；No Body & Blood 没有身体和血 |
    |     God’s Action 神的做工    | Christ is present to give blessings 基督到来给予祝福   |  Christ is crucified again 基督又被钉十字架  | None  没有做工 |
    |  Christ’s Command 基督的命令 | Eat & Drink for blessing  吃喝就能获得祝福 | Re-enact & offer Jesus’ sacrifice to God 重演，再一次使耶稣献祭给神  | Remember Jesus suffering & death 纪念基督的受难和死去 |
    | Blessings/0Benefit 祝福/恩惠     | Forgiveness of sins, Assurance of salvation 罪得赦免，确信获得救赎 |   Power to live a more deserving life 获得能力，可以过更加值得的生活     | Strengthens appreciation for Jesus 加强了对基督的感激 |


2. The Sacramental view is the teaching of the Bible.

    圣餐礼的观点是圣经教导的。

3. Some regard Holy Communion primarily as a ”Sacrifice“ in which the bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood and in which Jesus' sacrifice is re-enacted in an unbloody manner and offered to God as a payment for sins of the living and the dead.

    有的人认为，圣餐礼主要是一种”献祭“,在仪式里，饼和酒被变成基督的身体和宝血，耶稣的十字架牺牲以不涉及流血的方式被重演，向神献祭，作为对活着和死去的人的罪的赦免。

    1 Corinthians 11:26-29 – For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes. Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.

    哥林多前书11:26-29 ——26你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。27所以，无论何人不按理吃主的饼、喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身、主的血了。28人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼、喝这杯。29因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。

    a. The Bible counters this view by pointing out that communicants actually eat and drink the physical elements of bread and wine.

    圣经驳斥了这观点，指出，圣餐领受者实际上吃喝的是实实在在的饼和酒。

    Hebrews 9:25-26 – Nor did He （Jesus） enter heaven to offer Himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself.

    希伯来书9:25-26 ——25也不是多次将自己献上，像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入圣所（”牛羊的血“原文作”不是自己的血“）。26如果这样，他从创世以来，就必多次受苦了。但如今在这末世显现一次，把自己献为祭，好除掉罪。

    b. The Bible also opposes this view by teaching that Jesus made a complete once-for-all-people –and-for all-sins sacrifice that does not need to be repeated.

    圣经也驳斥了这个观点，教导说，耶稣已经做了一次完整的，一次就可以救赎所有人所有罪的牺牲，不需要重复。

    c. The ”sacrificial“ view treats Jesus' redeeming work with great contempt and makes Holy Communion a meriting work of people rather than a precious gift of God.

    ”献祭“的观点以极大的轻蔑看待耶稣的救赎工作，使圣餐礼成为显示人美德的工作，而不是神宝贵的礼物。

4. Some regard Holy Communion primarily as a ”Symbol“ in which Jesus' body and blood are represented, but not really present, and in which people can remember Jesus' sacrifice for their sins on Calvary but receive no forgiveness.

    有些人把圣餐礼主要看做是一种”象征“,基督的身体和宝血是代表的，而不是真正的。人们从中纪念耶稣在加略山为他们牺牲赎罪，但是没有获得宽恕。

    1 Corinthians 10:16 – Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?

    哥林多前书 10:16 ——我们所祝福的杯，岂不是同领基督的血吗？我们所擘开的饼，岂不是同领基督的身体吗？

    a. The Bible counters this view by teaching that communicants actually take part or participate in Christ's body and blood which are present in Communion.

    圣经驳斥这个观点，教导说，领受圣餐者实际上同领了出现在圣餐里的基督的身体和宝血。

    Matthew 26:28 – This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

    马太福音 26:28 ——因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。

    b. The Bible also opposes this view by indicating that God actually gives forgiveness of sins in Holy Communion.

    圣经也通过指出，神实际上在圣餐里赦免了人的罪，来驳斥这观点。

    c. The ”symbolical“ view denies the true essence of Holy Communion and leaves it a powerless, empty ceremony.

    ”象征的“观点否认了圣餐礼的真正要义，使圣餐礼成为空洞，没有能力的仪式。

### III. The Benefits And Purposes Of Holy Communion 圣餐礼的好处和目的

Hebrews 8:8b, 10a-12 – The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. 10aThis is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put My laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.

希伯来书8:8b, 10a-12 —

8b”日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约，

10主又说：“那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上；我要作他们的　神，他们要作我的子民。11他们不用各人教导自己的乡邻和自己的弟兄说：‘你该认识主，’因为他们从最小的到至大的，都必认识我。12我要宽恕他们的不义，不再记念他们的罪愆。”

Hebrews 9:15 – For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance— now that He has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.

希伯来书 9:15 —为此，他作了新约的中保，既然受死赎了人在前约之时所犯的罪过，便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。

Matthew 26:27-28 – Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, Drink from it, all of you. This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

马太福音 26:27-28 ——27又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说：“你们都喝这个，28因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。

A. By redeeming us, Jesus established the new covenant （a covenant is a solemn, binding agreement between people） that God had promised.

通过救赎我们，耶稣建立了神应许的新约（新约是庄严，必须要遵守的与人的约定）。

1. At the heart of this covenant of grace, God grants forgiveness of sins to people and has intimate fellowship with them.

    这个恩典的约定的核心是，神同意赦免人的罪，与人建立亲密的关系。

2. In Holy Communion, Jesus gives the blessings of that covenant: full forgiveness and intimate fellowship with God to His believing people.

    在圣餐礼中，耶稣给予新约的祝福：完全的宽恕，神与其信徒的亲密关系。

    Hebrews 9:14 – How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!

    希伯来书 9:14 ——何况基督藉着永远的灵，将自己无瑕无疵献给神，他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心（原文作”良心“），除去你们的死行，使你们侍奉那永生神吗？

3. Jesus uses these blessings to increase our faith in God so we are sure of His pardon and strengthened to serve Him.

    耶稣使用这些祝福增长我们对神的信心，我们就会确信神的宽恕，更加有力量的侍奉神。

Luke 22:19-20 – And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ”This is My body given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.“ In the same way, after the supper He took the cup, saying, ”This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.“

路加福音 22:19-20  ——19又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开，递给他们，说：”这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。“ 20饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：”这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。

B. In Holy Communion, Jesus gives us the forgiveness of sins in a most personal, convincing way.

在圣餐礼中，耶稣以最亲自的，令人心悦诚服的方式给我们罪得赦免。

1. He gives individually to believers His body and blood which He offered into death to secure our forgiveness.

    耶稣把献祭的基督的身体和宝血给每个信徒，获得我们罪的赦免。

2. He gives this gift in a way that involves all our senses.

    耶稣给我们的这份礼物是让我们所有感官都可以感觉到的。

1 Corinthians 11:26 – For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.

哥林多前书 11:26 —你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。

C. By celebrating Holy Communion, we personally remember and publicly confess that Jesus died to give us forgiveness and eternal life.

通过庆祝圣餐，我们每个人都纪念和公开忏悔耶稣为我们受死，赢得罪的赦免和永生。

1 Corinthians 10:17 – Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.

哥林多前书 10:17 —我们虽多，仍是一个饼、一个身体，因为我们都是分受这一个饼。

D. By celebrating Holy Communion, we also express our united fellowship with God and other believers in Christ, the precious result of our Spirit-created faith.

通过庆祝圣餐，我们也表达在基督里与神和其他信徒的一体的联合，这是圣灵建立的信心的宝贵结果。

### IV. Who Is To Partake Of Holy Communion 谁分受圣餐

1 Corinthians 11:23-29 – For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.“ In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, ”This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of Me.“ For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes. Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.

哥林多前书 11:23-29 ——23我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的，就是主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来， 24祝谢了，就掰开，说，这是我的身体，为你们舍的（舍有古卷作掰开）。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。25饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说：”这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。“26你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。 27所以，无论何人不按理吃主的饼、喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身、主的血了。28人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼、喝这杯。29因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。

A. Jesus intends that His properly prepared Christians partake of Holy Communion.

耶稣打算让耶稣妥善预备的基督徒分受圣餐。

1. They are the ones who in faith know and confess （”remember and proclaim“） the meaning of Jesus' death and its blessings.

    这些信徒在信心里知道和承认（纪念和宣告）耶稣的遇难和祝福的意义。

2. They are the ones who spiritually examine themselves and believe:

    这些信徒在灵性上反省自己和相信：

    a. that they are sinful and need God's forgiveness.

    他们是有罪的，需要神的宽恕。

    b. that God forgives them because of Jesus' redeeming work.

    因为耶稣的救赎工作，神宽恕了他们

    c. that Jesus' body and blood are truly present in the Sacrament to give them the forgiveness of sins.

    耶稣的身体和宝血确实存在于圣餐中，使罪得赦免。

B. In accord with Jesus' will, we carefully instruct people in the Bible's teachings prior to receiving Holy Communion. After this strengthening instruction, they publicly confess their faith in Jesus and their unity in faith with other believers and so indicate their readiness to receive Holy Communion （confirmation）。

按照耶稣的意愿，在人们领受圣餐前，我们要按照圣经的教导认真指示人们。在强化的教导指示后，信徒公开承认信靠耶稣和与其他 信徒在信心里的一体，这样，表明他们愿意领受圣餐。（坚信礼）

C. Christ's Words ”given for you“ and ”poured out for you,“ place God's blessing into the Sacrament. Communicants receive the benefit of these blessings through Spirit-worked faith in Christ's promise.

基督的话”为你们舍的“和”为你们流出来的“,把神的祝福放进圣餐里。通过由圣灵做工获得的基督里应许的信心，领受者获得这些祝福的益处。

D. God warns against taking Holy Communion unworthily or improperly.

神警告领受圣餐时不敬虔或者表现不当。

1. Unworthy or improper reception consists of a failure to recognize the real presence of Jesus' body and blood and unbelief （the rejection of God's Word of Law and/or Gospel）。

    不敬虔或者不恰当的领受指的是没有认识到耶稣的身体和宝血的真实存在，和不信（拒绝神律法和福音的话语）

    1 John 1:8 – If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.

    约翰一书 1:8 —我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了；

2. Sin by itself does not make a person unworthy, but a lack of repentance does. Impenitence is refusing to believe God's Law.

    罪恶本身没有使人卑劣，但是不去忏悔确实使人卑劣。不悔悟就是拒绝信神的律法。

3. Unworthy reception results in God's judgment on the unworthy communicant. Such a person receives Christ's body and blood not to his/her benefit, but to his/her harm.

    不敬虔的领受导致神审判不敬虔的领受者。这样的人领受基督的身体和宝血，只会伤害自己，而不会带来任何好处。

4. It is possible for a person to repent of the sin of unworthy reception and be forgiven for it.

    一个人如果忏悔自己不敬虔领受的罪，是可以获得宽恕的。

E. Because of God's warning and judgment on improper reception of Holy Communion, we lovingly exclude from Communion those who cannot or will not repent of their sins and believe in Jesus and His promises in the Sacrament.

因为神会警告和审判对圣餐领受不当的罪，我们出于爱心考虑，排除那些不能或未来不会忏悔自己的罪，信靠耶稣和耶稣在圣餐里的应许的人领受圣餐。

1. The unbelievers or ungodly who openly confess their unbelief.

    公开承认自己不信的非信徒或者不属神的人

2. The openly unrepentant who by words or actions refuse to admit their sinfulness.

    言语或行动拒绝承认自己有罪的公然的不忏悔者

3. The insane or severely mentally disabled or those in a coma who are not capable of examining themselves properly.

    不能正确反省自己的精神病患者或者严重智障人士或昏迷人士

4. The uninstructed, children and adults, who are not properly instructed in the teachings of the Bible and so cannot properly examine themselves.

    没有获得圣经里教导的正确指示的，因而不能正确反省自己的，未受指示的人，孩童，和成人。

5. Those who teach or follow false doctrine and are not part of the fellowship of the true Christian faith. （This is explained more fully in the next session.）

    那些教导或者追随错误教义的人不是真正基督信仰的肢体部分。（这会在下一个阶段更加详尽的解释）

### V. Common Faith Communion 共同信仰圣餐

A. On the basis of the teachings of God's Word , we are led to practice a common faith （also called ”close“ or ”fellowship“） communion in which we join in Holy Communion those who are correctly instructed in the teachings of God's Word, who publicly confess their faith in them, and who are willing and able to examine themselves spiritually.

根据神的话语的教导，我们被召集实行共同信仰（又称为亲密或团契）圣餐仪式，那些正确领受神的话语教导指示的，公开承认信仰，能够而且愿意在灵性上反省自己的人聚在一起。

B. This practice is sometimes misunderstood and misinterpreted as an unloving practice. A biblical look at this practice will help us understand it correctly.

这个做法有时候会被误解，曲解成没有爱的做法。经文对这个做法的说法会有助于我们正确理解。

1 Corinthians 11:29 – For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.

哥林多前书 11:29 —因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。

C. To invite people who were not taught to recognize Jesus' body and blood in Communion to commune is to invite them to receive God's judgment on themselves.

人们如果没有领受去分辨耶稣的身体和宝血的教导，就去领受圣餐，就会招来神对自己的审判。

1. This is a cruel, unloving thing to do.

    这是冷酷的，没有爱的做法。

2. Christian love refuses to let this harm come to them and strives to warn of the danger and help that person gain a proper understanding first so they can properly commune later.

    基督徒之间的爱，拒绝让这样的伤害发生，努力设法警告这样的危险，帮助那个人先获得正确的理解，然后确保正确领受圣餐。

1 Corinthians 10:17 – Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body for we all partake of the one loaf.

哥林多前书 10:17 —我们虽多，仍是一个饼、一个身体，因为我们都是分受这一个饼。

Matthew 28:20a – And teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

马太福音 28:20a —凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，

Romans 16:17 – ”I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.

罗马书 16:17 —弟兄们，那些离间你们、叫你们跌倒、背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。

D. Holy Communion is an expression of unity of faith among people.

圣餐是表达人们信心一体。

1. Jesus wants us to be united on all that He tells us in His Word.

    耶稣想要我们在他教导我们的话语的每一个层面都连成一体。

2. If a person by his/her public confession （which includes membership in a congregation and church body） disagrees with what the Bible teaches （and we believe） as true, he/he is not truly united with us in faith.

    如果某人（包括会众或者教会的成员）的公开忏悔认罪不符合圣经的教导（以及我们认为正确的事情），这个人就没有在信心里与我们联合一体。

3. To commune a person who confesses contrary to God's Word is both dishonest and misleading.

    把一个背离神话语的忏悔认罪的人带入领受圣餐，既不诚实，又误导人。

4. Excluding from Communion those who have a confession that is contrary to the Word is a concerned call to them to accept the true teaching of the Bible and be united with us in faith.

    把背离神的话语忏悔认罪的人排除在圣餐以外，是充满关爱的呼吁他们接受圣经的真道，在信心里与我们成为一体。

### VI. Proper Preparation For Holy Communion 圣餐前的适当准备。

A. Good participation in Holy Communion requires good preparation.

充分准备才能确保好好参加圣餐。

2 Corinthians 13:5 – Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?

哥林多后书 13:5 —你们总要自己省察有信心没有。也要自己试验。岂不知你们若不是可弃绝的，就有耶稣基督在你们心里吗。

B. Before we attend Holy Communion, God wants us to examine ourselves to see if we are sorry for our sins, trust in Jesus' forgiveness for us and recognize what Holy Communion is and gives.

在我们参加圣餐之前，神想要我们省察自己，看看自己是否为罪忏悔，是否相信耶稣救赎我们，认识到圣餐是什么，圣餐给予我们什么。

C. A good method of preparation is to ask ourselves these questions:

准备的好方法就是问自己如下问题：

1. Do I believe that I am a sinner? （Yes）

    我相信自己是罪人吗？（是的）

2. Am I sorry for my sins? （Yes）

    我为自己的罪忏悔吗？（是的）

3. Do I believe that Jesus is my Savior from sin and that He has earned forgiveness for me by His life, death and resurrection? （Yes）

    我相信耶稣是我的救主，救赎我脱离罪，并且以他的生，受难和复活为我赢得了宽恕吗？（是的）

4. Do I believe that in the Lord's Supper I actually receive with the bread and wine the true body and blood of Jesus for the assurance of the forgiveness of my sins? （Yes）

    我是否相信在圣餐里，我实际上领受的是耶稣真正的身体和宝血（与饼和酒一同领受），以便确保我的罪得赦免？（是的）

5. Do I desire to improve my sinful life and, with God helping me, dedicate my life ever more to Christ and to His service? （Yes）

    我是否愿意改变我有罪的生活，在神的帮助下，越发奉献自己给基督和侍奉神？（是的）

D. Our self examination may reveal we have committed many sins and/or that we have a weak faith. This discovery should be an encouragement rather than a discouragement to take Holy Communion.

我们的自省会揭示出，我们犯了很多罪，以及或者我们信心软弱。这样的发现应该作为领受圣餐的鼓励，而不是气馁的原因。

Romans 5:6 – You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.

罗马书 5:6 —因我们还软弱的时候，基督就按所定的日期为罪人死。

Mark 9:24 – Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!”

马可福音 9:24 —孩子的父亲立时喊着说（有古卷作“立时流泪地喊着说”）：“我信，但我信不足，求主帮助！”

John 6:37b – “Whoever comes to Me I will never drive away.”

约翰福音 6:37b —到我这里来的，我总不丢弃他。

1. Proper reception of Holy Communion requires a sincere sorrow for sins and faith in Christ to forgive.、

    正确的领受圣餐需要恳切的为罪忏悔，和基督里宽恕的信心。

2. As long as we are sorry for our sins and believe that Jesus forgives our sins, we may receive Holy Communion. Jesus will not refuse a repentant believer even though his/her sins are many and his/her faith is weak.

    只要我们为罪忏悔，相信耶稣赦免我们的罪，我们就可以领受圣餐。耶稣不会拒绝一个忏悔罪的信徒，尽管他的罪很多，信心也软弱。

3. In fact, Jesus will use Holy Communion to assure us that He has forgiven our sins to strengthen our faith in Him.

    事实上，耶稣使用圣餐来使我们确信，神已经赦免了我们的罪，并且加固了我们对基督的信靠。

    Psalm 32:3, 5 – When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord” – and You forgave the guilt of my sin.

    诗篇 32:3,5 —

    3我闭口不认罪的时候，因终日唉哼而骨头枯干。

    5我向你陈明我的罪，不隐瞒我的恶。我说：“我要向耶和华承认我的过犯。”你就赦免我的罪恶。（细拉）

4. If a particular sin is troubling a person, he/she should speak with the pastor about it prior to communing.

    如果某个罪正在烦扰一个人，在领受圣餐前，该人应该向牧师请教。

    a. In this way, the matter can be resolved through personal confession and absolution.

    通过这种方式，事情可以由个人认罪和赦罪来解决。

    b. After this, the person may commune with an untroubled conscience.

    之后，该人可以除去良心的不安，领受圣餐。

### VII. Regular Reception Of Holy Communion 经常领受圣餐

Luke 22:19-20 – And He （Jesus） took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way, after the supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.”

路加福音 22:19-20 ——19又拿起饼来，祝谢了，就擘开，递给他们，说：“这是我的身体，为你们舍的，你们也应当如此行，为的是记念我。” 20饭后也照样拿起杯来，说：“这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。

D. Through the example of the early Christians, God teaches us to receive Holy Communion regularly – unless there is some serious reason not to.

从早期基督徒的事例中看出，神教导我们经常要领受圣餐，除非有严重的不能领受的原因。

E. Taking Holy Communion frequently does not mean that we may or will take it for granted. If we prepare well and remember this Sacrament's worth, we can take it frequently without despising it.

频繁的领受圣餐并不意味着我们就可以对圣餐习以为常。如果我们准备充分，一直牢记圣礼的价值，我们就可以不轻视圣餐的同时，频繁领受圣餐。

Hymn 312: 1, 8 in Christian Worship: “Lord Jesus Christ, You Have Prepared”

Lord Jesus Christ, You have prepared This feast for our salvation;

It is Your body and Your blood, And at Your invitation

As weary souls, with sin oppressed, We come to You for needed rest,

For comfort, and for pardon.

For Your consoling supper, Lord, Be praise throughout all ages!

Preserve it, for in every place The world against it rages.

Grant that this sacrament may be A blessed comfort unto me

When living and when dying.
