复习第6课的课后作业问题

### I. God Warns Against Subverting The Holy Spirit's Work 神警告破坏圣灵的工作的事情

Acts 7:51 – “You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!

使徒行传 7:51 —你们这硬着颈项、心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵；你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样！

1 Thessalonians 5:19 – Do not put out the Spirit's fire;

帖撒罗尼迦前书 5:19 —不要消灭圣灵的感动，

A. People can resist and undermine the Holy Spirit's sanctifying work in the Gospel. God warns us to be on guard against this and not refuse the Spirit's converting and strengthening influence in our hearts.

人们会抵制，削弱圣灵在福音中的成圣工作。神警告我们要警惕这个，不要拒绝圣灵在我们心里的转变工作和增添力量。

2 Corinthians 6:1-2 – As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. For He says, ”In the time of My favor I heard you,  and in the day of salvation I helped you. I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.

哥林多后书 6:1-2 ——1我们与　神同工的，也劝你们，不可徒受他的恩典。 2因为他说，在悦纳的时候，我应允了你。在拯救的日子，我搭救了你。看哪，现在正是悦纳的时候，现在正是拯救的日子。

Hebrews 3:18-19, 4:2, 7b – 18And to whom did God swear that they would never enter His rest if not to those who disobeyed? 19So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief. （4:2）For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith. （7b） “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”

希伯来书 3：18--19， 4：2，7b —

18又向谁起誓，不容他们进入他的安息呢？岂不是向那些不信从的人吗？ 19这样看来，他们不能进入安息是因为不信的缘故了。

4:2因为有福音传给我们，像传给他们一样；只是所听见的道与他们无益，因为他们没有信心与所听见的道调和。

4:7b你们今日若听他的话，就不可硬着心。

John 12:37 – Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe Him.

约翰福音 12:37 —他虽然在他们面前行了许多神迹，他们还是不信他。

B. God urgently pleads with people in their time of opportunity to believe the Gospel and not resist the Spirit's work to bring them to faith in Jesus.

神急切的劝勉人在合适的时机相信福音，不要抵制圣灵引导人归向信靠耶稣基督。

1. The Holy Spirit's call to faith in the Gospel is freely offered, sincere given, powerful communicated, and clearly intended for all.

    圣灵召唤人们信福音，是没有附加条件的，真诚的，通过强有力的沟通，并且明确针对所有人。

2. Sadly, people can prevent their coming to faith and forfeit Christ's salvation blessings by allowing influences such as self-righteousness, a love of sin, pride and despair to dominate their hearts and so spurn the Spirit's converting influence.

    不幸的是，自以为是，贪恋罪，自大，绝望的作用会控制人心，使人拒绝圣灵转变人心，导致人们会抵制信靠耶稣，丧失基督的救赎的恩惠。

3. God does not want anyone to despise or deny the opportunity He presents to come to faith. God gives a limited number of opportunities to come to faith and no one can be sure if he/she will receive another chance （For example: The rich fool in Luke 12:15-21）

    神不愿意任何人鄙视或者拒绝神提供给人决志信主的机会。神提供给人决志信主的机会是有限的，没有人确定自己是否会有下一个机会。（例如，路加福音 12:15---21里无知的财主）

Ephesians 4:30 – And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

以弗所书 4:30 —不要叫神的圣灵担忧；你们原是受了他的印记，等候得赎的日子来到。

Hebrews 3:12-15 – See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first. As has just been said:  “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.”

希伯来书 3:12-15 ——12弟兄们，你们要谨慎，免得你们中间或有人存着不信的恶心，把永生神离弃了。 13总要趁着还有今日，天天彼此相劝，免得你们中间有人被罪迷惑，心里就刚硬了。 14我们若将起初确实的信心坚持到底，就在基督里有分了。 15经上说：“你们今日若听他的话，就不可硬着心，像惹他发怒的日子一样。”

Luke 8:13b – They believe for awhile, but in the time of testing fall away.

路加福音 8:13b –不过暂时相信，及至遇见试炼就退后了；

C. God warns Christians not to damage or destroy their faith in Christ.

神警告基督徒不要毁坏基督的信心。

1. Believers can weaken and even destroy their faith in Jesus. The Bible does not teach an “eternal security” which claims that once a person is saved he/she can never fall away and lose their faith.

    信徒可能会削弱甚至毁掉他们对基督的信靠。圣经没有教导“永久的保障”---就是说，一旦一个人获得了救赎，他/她就不会跌倒，失去信心。

2. Among the influences that can lead to a loss of faith are: neglect of the Gospel, accepting a work-righteous view of salvation, a love of the pleasures of the sinful world, willful sins and a refusal to repent of sin.

    导致人们失去信心的因素有----忽略福音，接受因好行为就能称义的获救观点，贪恋罪性世界的享乐，妄为的罪过，拒绝为罪忏悔。

    Psalm 19:13 – Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.

    诗篇 19:13 – 求你拦阻仆人不犯任意妄为的罪，不容这罪辖制我，我便完全，免犯大罪。

    1John 5:16b – There is a sin that leads to death.

    约翰一书 5:16b —有至于死的罪。

    1 Tim 1:19 – Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith.

    提摩太前书 1:19 —常存信心和无亏的良心；有人丢弃良心，就在真道上如同船破坏了一般。

3. Willful sins are sins which a person commits when he/she clearly knows what God's Word says on a manner, and is convinced the Word is true, but then purposely rejects the warning of his/her conscience and commits that sin without repenting. Such sins destroy saving faith.

    妄为的罪就是一个人明知道神在一件事上的教导，相信教导的正确，但是有意的拒绝自己良心的警告，毫无悔过之意去犯罪。这样的罪毁掉了救赎的信心。

    Matthew 26:41 – “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”

    马太福音 26:41 –总要警醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。

    2 Peter 3:17-18 – Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

    彼得后书 3:17-18 ——17亲爱的弟兄阿，你们既然豫先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。18你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们。

4. The way to avoid weakness or loss of faith is to be watchful at all times against temptation and to be growing continually in the Gospel of Christ.

    避免软弱或丧失信心的方法就是时刻警醒，抵制诱惑， 在基督的福音里不断成长。

Ephesians 4:18 – They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

以弗所书 4:18 —他们心地昏昧，与神所赐的生命隔绝了，都因自己无知，心里刚硬；

Romans 11:7b-8 – The others were hardened, as it is written:   “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see  and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day.”

罗马书 11:7b-8 ——7b其余的就成了顽梗不化的。8如经上所记：“　神给他们昏迷的心，眼睛不能看见，耳朵不能听见，直到今日。”

D. People who persist in unbelief and resistance to the gospel harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit's influence. God may, as an act of judgment, harden their hearts further so that it is no longer possible for them to come to faith.

坚持不信，抵制福音的人，心里顽固不化，圣灵无法发挥作用。神可能会作为审判的方式，进一步坚硬他们的心，最后他们再也不可能决志信主。

Mark 3:28-29 – I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.“

马可福音3:28-29 ——28我实在告诉你们：世人一切的罪和一切亵渎的话都可得赦免；29凡亵渎圣灵的，却永不得赦免，乃要担当永远的罪。”

Hebrews 6:4-6 – It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, 6if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to public disgrace.

希伯来书6:4-6 ——4论到那些已经蒙了光照、尝过天恩的滋味、又于圣灵有分、 5并尝过神善道的滋味、觉悟来世权能的人， 6若是离弃道理，就不能叫他们从新懊悔了。因为他们把神的儿子重钉十字架，明明地羞辱他。

Hebrews 10:26-29 – If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?

希伯来书 10:26-29 ——26因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了，27惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火。28人干犯摩西的律法，凭两三个见证人尚且不得怜恤而死；29何况人践踏神的儿子，将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常，又亵慢施恩的圣灵，你们想，他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢？

E. People who persist in unbelief may also commit the sin against the Holy Spirit.

那些坚持不信的人也会犯罪亵渎圣灵。

1. The sin against the Holy Spirit is a malicious, spiteful rejection and open, callous contempt for the Gospel truths through which the Holy Spirit works to bring people to and keep them in saving faith in Jesus.

    犯罪亵渎圣灵是恶意的，恶毒的拒绝福音，是对福音真道冷酷的轻蔑。圣灵通过福音带领人们决志信主，并且保守对基督的救赎信心。

2. This sin is unforgivable, not because Jesus didn't pay for it, but because its direct assault against the Spirit's efforts to convert people makes repentance impossible.

    这种罪无法饶恕，不是因为耶稣没有赎掉这罪，而是因为这是对圣灵转化人工作的直接攻击，使得忏悔变得不可能。

    Jeremiah 31:18b – Restore me, and I will return, because You are the Lord my God.

    耶利米书 31:18b –求你使我回转，我便回转，因为你是耶和华我的神。

    Job 33:26-28 – He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state. Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved. He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'

    约伯记33:26-28 ——26他祷告神，神就喜悦他，使他欢呼朝见神的面；　神又看他为义。27他在人前歌唱说：‘我犯了罪，颠倒是非，这竟与我无益。28神救赎我的灵魂免入深坑，我的生命也必见光。'

    God can and does bring back to faith people who have previously fallen away.

    神能够而且确实使曾经跌倒的人重新决志信主。

1. In great mercy God does reconvert people who have carelessly fallen from faith （Perhaps this was true of King David.）

    神确实以极大的慈爱重新转化不小心跌倒的人（或许大卫王就是个例子）

2. We rejoice in such a great love that reclaims the fallen, but we dare not abuse His love by presuming that God must and will do it for us.

    神挽救曾经跌倒的人，我们为着神如此大的慈爱欢呼，但是我们不能滥用神的爱----不能认为神必须，也会为我们这样做。

Acts 20:28a, 31a – Keep watch over yourselves. Be on your guard.

使徒行传20:28a, 31a --

28a你们就当为自己谨慎，

31a所以你们应当警醒，

F. God charges us to be vigilant against temptations to resist or reject the Spirit's work in our lives.

神叮嘱我们警惕那些抵制，拒绝圣灵在我们生命里做工的诱惑。

### II. The Holy Spirit Preserves Believers In Saving Faith 圣灵保守信徒救赎的信心

Acts 20:32 – “Now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.”

使徒行传20:32 —如今我把你们交托神和他恩惠的道；这道能建立你们，叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。

A. God the Holy Spirit strengthens and preserves us in saving faith through our use of the Word of God. We are to use that Word regularly and not neglect it.

通过我们应用神的话语，圣灵加固，保守我们救赎的信心。我们要时常应用神的话语，不能忽视。

Hebrews 6:19a – We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.

希伯来书6:19a —我们有这指望，如同灵魂的锚，又坚固、又牢靠，

B. We use God's Word so that our faith will grow stronger and not become weaker. A strong faith is a great blessing because it allows us to have greater confidence of salvation and increased strength for a fruitful life of good works.

我们应用神的话语，我们的信心才能壮大，不至软弱。强大的信心是一个很大的恩惠，因为这使我们能够对救赎有更大的信心，并且增添力量，生活里的好行为才会结果子。

C. In order to preserve us in faith, the Holy Spirit uses both the Law and Gospel:

为了保守我们的信心，圣灵同时使用律法和福音。

1 Corinthians 10:12 – So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!

哥林多前书 10:12 —所以，自己以为站得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒。

Hebrews 2:1 – We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.

希伯来书 2:1 —所以，我们当越发郑重所听见的道理，恐怕我们随流失去。

1. The Spirit speaks sharp warnings of the Law to our sinful nature so that we do not become proud and careless and fall from faith.

    圣灵用律法严厉的警告我们的罪性，以免我们骄傲自大，不小心跌倒，失去信心。

    John 10:28-29 – I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand.

    约翰福音10:28-29 ——28我又赐给他们永生，他们永不灭亡，谁也不能从我手里把他们夺去。29我父把羊赐给我，他比万有都大，谁也不能从我父手里把他们夺去。

    Philippians 1:6 – Being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

    腓立比书1:6 —我深信那在你们心里动了善工的，必成全这工，直到耶稣基督的日子。

2. The Spirit speaks comforting promises of the Gospel to our believing nature so that we do not despair over our sinful weakness, but cling to Christ in faith for forgiveness and eternal life.

    圣灵把福音的安慰人心的应许告诉我们信靠的特性，以免我们因为自己肉体软弱而绝望，而是紧紧抓住基督里的救赎信心，获得赦免和永生。

### III. Sacraments 圣礼

A. God has not only accomplished our redemption through Christ. He has also provided the Gospel as the means by which the Holy Spirit can and does bring the benefits of Jesus' redeeming work into our hearts and lives.

神不仅仅在基督里完成了对我们的救赎。也提供了福音作为管道，从中圣灵得以，并且确实把基督的救赎工作的好处带到我们的心里和生命里。

B. The Gospel comes in the form of the Word （as it is heard, read or remembered by people） and of the Sacraments. These means of grace are God's precious “Gospel delivery system” for us.

福音以话语的形式表现（人们可以听闻它，读到它，记住它），福音也通过圣礼表现。这些恩典的管道是神提供给我们的珍贵的“福音救赎系统”.

C. We will now consider the two Sacraments God gives us to bring us Christ's blessings.

我们将思考神提供给我们的，带给我们基督里恩惠的2个圣礼仪式。

D. What a sacrament is:

圣礼是什么：

1. The word “sacrament” originally comes from the Latin word “sacramentum” which means “a solemn, sacred pledge.” In the sacraments, God makes a solemn, sacred pledge to bless people because of Christ.

    “圣礼”最初来自于拉丁词“sacramentum”,意思是庄严，神圣的承诺。在圣礼中，神做出庄严，神圣的承诺来因为基督的缘故祝福人。

2. We define a Sacrament as:

    我们把圣礼定义成：

    a. A sacred act – in which God is at work, imparting something to us.

    一项神圣的行为---神在里面做工，把某些东西赋予给我们。

    b. Instituted by Christ – established and commanded by Jesus for us to do.

    由基督设立的----由基督建立，命令我们去做。

    c. In which through visible elements – physical substances （water, bread, wine,） which affect our senses.

    通过可见的要素-----物质实体（水，饼，酒）作用于我们的感官。

    d. Connected with God's Word – which give the Sacraments their power.

    与神的话语连接-----赋予圣礼能力。

    e. God offers, gives and assures to us forgiveness of sins, eternal life and saving grace. - the blessings that Jesus has won for us.

    神提供，给予，确保我们罪得赦免，永生，救赎的恩典。-----这些都是基督为我们赢得的恩典。

E. The Sacraments are the Sacrament Of Holy Baptism and the Sacrament of Holy Communion.

圣礼是施洗仪式和圣餐仪式。

F. Sacraments are not just marks that identify people as Christians. Nor are they merely signs which only symbolize spiritual blessings. Sacraments are means by which God actually gives spiritual blessings to people.

圣礼不仅仅是识别人们为基督徒的记号。也不仅仅是单单象征灵里恩惠的记号。圣礼实际上是神给予人们灵里恩惠的管道。

G. Sacraments are not sacrifices in which people offer something to God. In Sacraments God is the one who offers and gives His blessings to people.

圣礼不是人向神献祭。在圣礼中，是神向人们提供给予神的恩典。

H. Sacraments are also not like other rites and ceremonies of the Church （such as confirmation, marriage, funeral）。 Although these are fine practices, God has not attached His promise of Gospel blessings to them.

圣礼也不同于教会的其他仪式（比如坚信礼，婚礼，葬礼）。虽然这些也是很好的仪式，神并没有把福音的应许恩惠加进去。

### IV. What Baptism Is 受洗是什么

Matthew 28:18-20 – Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

马太福音 28:18-20 ——18耶稣进前来，对他们说：“天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了。 19所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作”给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。20凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。“

A. Jesus instituted Baptism as part of His ”Great Commission“

耶稣设立施洗作为他的”大使命“的一部分。

1. Baptism is the application of water connected with God's to a person.

    受洗是把与神连接的水洒到人身上。

2. A person is baptized ”in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit“, that is, into an intimate, blessed relationship with the Triune God. In Baptism God lovingly lays claim to a person's life, makes that person His own dear child and gives him/her all His spiritual blessings （including His mercy, pardon and protection）。

    一个人奉父、子、圣灵的名受洗，就是说，进入了与三位一体的神亲密的，有福的关系。在受洗仪式里，神充满慈爱的认领人的生命，使这个人成为神喜爱的孩子，给他或她所有灵里的祝福（包括神的慈爱，宽恕，和保护）

Matthew 3:11 – ”I baptize you with water for repentance. But after Me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

马太福音 3:11 ——我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。

B. The earthly element in baptism is water.

水是受洗里的尘世要素。

1. God uses a common element, often used for physical cleansing, to accomplish spiritual cleansing.

    神使用普通常见的要素，经常用于洁净身体，来完成灵里的洁净。

2. The word “baptize” originally comes from the Greek “baptizo” which means “to wash with or apply water.”

    “施洗”最初来自于希腊文“baptizo”,意思是“用水洗净或者洒水于”.

    We must use water, not another substance, for a proper baptism.

    我们必须使用水，而不是其他的东西，完成正确的施洗。

3. God does not specify the amount of water we are to use or the method of applying the water.

    神没有规定我们使用水的多少，或者洒水的方式。

    a. Some insist that total immersion is the only valid way to be baptized.

    有人认为完全的浸湿才是唯一正确有效的施洗方式。

    b. While immersion is a valid way to baptize, it is not the only way. Sprinkling, pouring or touching with water are equally valid ways.

    虽然浸湿是一种有效正确的施洗方式，却不是唯一的方式。洒，倾倒，或者用水轻触，都是同等正确有效的方式。

    Luke 11:38 – But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.

    路加福音11:38---这法利赛人看见耶稣饭前不洗手便诧异。

    c. Limiting the meaning of “baptizo” to “immerse” is not proper and makes nonsense of some Scripture passages where it is used.

    把“施洗”局限于“浸湿”是不对的，并且把经文涉及到施洗的地方曲解了，弄得经文没有意义。

C. A valid baptism requires the application of water with God's Word of promise, the name of the Triune God. Where these things are not present, there is no valid baptism.

正确有效的施洗需要用水，还要有神的应许话语，奉三位一体的神的名。如果这些没有具备，施洗就不会有效。

### V. The Blessing Of Baptism 施洗的恩惠

A. Baptism is more than just an empty ceremony. It is a true means of grace by which God's blessings come to us.

施洗不仅仅是一个表面的仪式。它是恩典的真实管道，神的恩惠得以进来给我们。

Galatians 3:26-27 – You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have been clothed with Christ.

加拉太书 3:26-27 ——26所以，你们因信基督耶稣，都是神的儿子。27你们受洗归入基督的，都是披戴基督了。

B. Through baptism, the Holy Spirit brings spiritually separated people into personal union with Christ and makes them God's children.

通过施洗，圣灵使灵里隔绝的人与基督融为一体，并且成为神的儿女。

Acts 2:38 – Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

使徒行传 2:38 —彼得说：”你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵“

1 Peter 3:21 – And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

彼得前书 3:21 —这水所表明的洗礼，现在藉着耶稣基督复活，也拯救你们；这洗礼本不在乎除掉肉体的污秽，只求在神面前有无亏的良心。

C. Through baptism, the Holy Spirit gives sinful people the forgiveness of sins and saves them.

通过施洗，圣灵给罪人罪得赦免，救赎了他们。

John 3:5 – Jesus answered, ”I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.

约翰福音 3:5 —耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你：人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。

D. Through baptism the Holy Spirit gives spiritually dead people new spiritual life and a place in God's kingdom.

通过施洗，圣灵给予灵里死去的人，新的灵命，和神的国的立足之地。

### VI. The Power In Baptism 施洗的能力

Ephesians 5:25b-26 – Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word.

以弗所书5:25b-26 ——25b正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。 26要用水藉着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁。

A. The water used in baptism has no power of, or in, itself. Baptism receives its great power to give blessings through the Word of God connected with the water.

施洗中使用的水本身没有能力。通过神的话语与水连接，施洗就获得了大能力，给人祝福。

Titus 3:5-7 – He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.

提多书 3:5-7 ——5他便救了我们，并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，藉着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。5圣灵就是神藉着耶稣基督我们救主厚厚浇灌在我们身上的，7好叫我们因他的恩得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣（或作”可以凭着盼望承受永生“）。

John 1:12-13 – Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.

约翰福音 1:12-13 ——12凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。13这等人不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。

B. The Holy Spirit uses the Word of God in baptism to work faith in the hearts of the baptized so that they receive the blessings of Christ.

圣灵在施洗仪式里使用神的话语，在受洗人的心里做工，使他们获得信心，得到基督的恩惠。

1. Saving faith in Jesus is entirely God's creation in a person's heart. It is not, in any way, the result of a person's own decision, powers or effort.

    在基督里救赎的信心全部是神在人心里的创造。这绝不是一个人自己的决定，能力或者努力的结果。

2. Saving faith is always a gracious, miraculous gift of God whenever and in whomever it is worked.

    救赎的信心一直是来自神的慈爱的，神奇的礼物，无论何时都在任何人心里运作。

### VII. Who Is To Be Baptized 谁应该受洗

Matthew 28:19a – ”Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them…“

马太福音 28:19a —所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作”给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。

A. Christ commands us to baptize all people everywhere. He sets no limits （such as age, gender, nationality） on eligibility for baptism. Our Savior's love is so great that He wants all to receive its blessings.

耶稣基督吩咐我们给所有地方的人施洗。在受洗资格上，他没有设立限制（比如年龄，性别，国籍）。我们救主的爱是如此的大，他希望所有人都能获得受洗的恩惠。

B. Christ intends infants and children to be included in those baptized. We baptize them for the following reasons:

耶稣基督把婴幼儿和小孩也列入施洗的对象。我们因为如下的原因要给他们施洗：

1. They are part of “all nations.”

    他们是“万国”的一部分。

    Psalm 51:5 – Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.

    诗篇 51:5 —我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎的时候就有了罪。

    Ezekiel 18:4 – For every living soul belongs to Me, the father as well as the son—both alike belong to Me. The soul who sins is the one who will die.

    以西结书 18:4 —看哪！世人都是属我的：为父的怎样属我，为子的也照样属我。犯罪的他必死亡。

2. They are sinful by nature, are accountable for their sin, and need God's forgiveness.

    他们生来有罪，应当为罪承担后果，也需要神的赦免。

    Acts 2:38-39 – Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”

    使徒行传 2:38-39  ——38彼得说：“你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵； 39因为这应许是给你们和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们神所召来的。”

    God promises to give them forgiveness and the Holy Spirit through baptism.

    通过圣灵在施洗里的工作，神应许给他们罪得赦免。

    Luke 18:15-16 – People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have Him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

    路加福音18:15-16  ——15有人抱着自己的婴孩来见耶稣，要他摸他们；门徒看见就责备那些人。16耶稣却叫他们来，说：”让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在　神国的正是这样的人。

    Matthew 18:6a – One of these little ones who believe in Me

    马太福音 18:6a —凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的，

3. They can believe in Jesus as their Savior.

    他们能够信靠耶稣是他们的救主。

Acts 2:41a – Those who had accepted his message were baptized.

使徒行传 2:41a —于是，领受他话的人就受了洗。

Acts 8:35-38 – Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?”And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.

使徒行传 8:35-38 ——35腓利就开口从这经上起，对他传讲耶稣。 36二人正往前走，到了有水的地方，太监说：“看哪，这里有水，我受洗有什么妨碍呢？”（有古卷在此有 37腓利说：“你若是一心相信，就可以。”他回答说：“我信耶稣基督是神的儿子。”） 39于是吩咐车站住，腓利和太监二人同下水里去，腓利就给他施洗。

C. Older children and adults are baptized after they come to faith through and are instructed in God's Word. In situations like this, the Holy Spirit works in baptism to give added assurance to believers that they are God's children and heirs of His blessings.

大一点的孩子和成人在决志信主后受洗，听从神的话语的指示。在这样的情况下，圣灵在施洗仪式里做工，给信徒加添保障，告诉他们，他们是神的儿女，也是神恩惠的获得者。

D. We do not rebaptize people.

我们不重复施洗。

1. God's promise in baptism is always valid and does not need to be repeated.

    神在施洗仪式里的应许是有效的，不需要重复。

2. In fact, to rebaptize a person denies the truth and power of God's Word.

    事实上，重复给人施洗否定了神话语的真道和能力。

3. People who fall away from faith and are reconverted are not to be rebaptized. With their renewed faith, they are to claim the blessing God had previously extended to them in their baptism.

    那些从信心里跌倒，又重新归向主的人，不必再次受洗。有了重拾的信心，他们可以获得神在之前施洗时给他们的恩惠。

4. We will baptize a person who does not know if he/she ever was baptized. Although it may be a “rebaptism”, it will offer the certainty and comfort God wants him/her to have.

    我们会给那些不知道自己是否受过洗的人施洗。虽然这是重复施洗，但是会给他或她保障和安慰，这也是神想让他或她从中获得的。

### VIII. Who Is To Baptize 谁来施洗

A. Christ's command to baptize is given to all Christians. Every believer has the authority to baptize others.

基督吩咐所有基督徒给人施洗。每个基督徒都有权能给他人施洗。

1 Corinthians 14:40 – But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

哥林多前书 14:40 —凡事都要规规矩矩地按着次序行。

B. Pastors generally perform the baptism in our congregations. We call them to do this on behalf of the members so that the ministry of the Gospel is carried out efficiently and orderly.

牧师一般在教堂会众进行施洗。我们让牧师代表教会成员施洗，这样福音的事工才会进行的有效和有条理。

C. In cases of emergency, when a pastor is not available, any believer can perform a baptism. To perform baptism:

如果事情紧急，而牧师又没有在，任何一个信徒可以施洗。施洗步骤：

1. Apply water to the person

    洒水到受洗人身上

2. Say, “I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

    ”说，“我奉父，子，圣灵的名义给你施洗。”

D. Can an unbeliever perform a valid baptism?

非信徒可以实行正确有效的施洗吗？

1. Yes. The power of baptism is dependent on the Holy Spirit working through the Gospel, not on the faith of the baptizer.

    可以。施洗的能力来自于圣灵在福音里的做工，而不是来自于施洗者的信心。

2. A baptism which uses the gospel is valid even if the baptizer does not personally believe it.

    使用福音的施洗是正确有效的，即使施洗者本人并不信福音。

E. Sponsors and witnesses

教父和证人

1. Many people follow the fine Christian custom of having godparents for their baptized children.

    很多人遵守基督徒的良好传统，为受洗的孩子找教父。
    
2. Some parents choose sponsors who witness the baptism and later strive to encourage and assist their godchild in his/her spiritual life with their counsel, prayers and example.

    有些父母选择教父见证孩子的受洗过程，在以后会在灵性生活里，努力鼓励，帮助他们的教子教女，为其提供建议，祷告，还有榜样示范。

3. Because of the nature of their responsibilities, sponsors should be strong, mature Christians who embrace the teachings of the church and are members of its fellowship.

    由于涉及到教父的责任特点，教父必须是灵里坚固，成熟的基督徒，拥护教会的教导，并且是团契的成员。

4. Some parents choose witnesses who witness the baptism but do not assume the duties of a sponsor. Witnesses do not have to be members of the church or its fellowship.

    有些父母会选择见证人，见证受洗过程，但是不承担教父的责任。见证人不一定是教会或者团契成员。

### IX. The Need For Baptism And The Unbaptized 受洗的必要和没有受洗的人

A. Do people need to be baptized in order to be saved?

人们是否需要受洗才能获得救赎？

Mark 16:16 – Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

马可福音 16:16 —信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。

B. God clearly states that He wants everyone to be baptized and that baptism is a way through which He saves people.

神清楚的说，神想要所有人受洗，受洗是神救赎人的方式。

C. However, God does not say that all who die without being baptized are lost eternally.

然而，神并没有说，所有未经受洗就去世的人，就会永久迷路。

1. It is faith in Jesus that saves and unbelief that condemns.

    是基督里的信心使人获救，不信的就要定罪。

2. Saving faith can exist without baptism. A person may come to faith through the Word apart from baptism.

    获救的信心可以没有施洗依然存在。除了受洗，一个人可能会通过神的话语决志信主。

    Luke 7:30 – But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.

    路加福音 7:30 —但法利赛人和律法师，没有受过约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。（二十九三十两节或作众百姓和税吏听见了约翰的话就受了他的洗便以神为义但法利赛人和律法师不受约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。）

3. While baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation, it is not optional. A person cannot despise baptism and still be saved.

    虽然受洗并不是获救的先决条件，但是受洗是强制的。一个人不能既鄙视受洗，又能获得救赎。

4. One who truly believes will want baptism.

    一个真正信主的人愿意受洗。

D. What about the children who die before they have an opportunity to be baptized or learn the Gospel?

如果一个孩子未能有机会受洗或听闻福音就去世了，怎么办？

1. God has bound us to the Gospel in the Word and Sacraments as the means of salvation. God has told us of no other way by which people may come to faith in Christ.

    神已经把我们与神话语的福音，圣礼绑定在一起，作为救赎的途径。神没有说其他途径也可以使人决志信主。

    Luke 1:41 – When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

    路加福音 1:41 —以利沙伯一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动。以利沙伯且被圣灵充满，

2. However, God does not limit Himself to save by those means only. He gives the extraordinary example of John the Baptist who was given the Holy Spirit even before birth.

    但是，神也没有让这些救赎途径限制神的救赎。神给了一个很奇妙的例子---施洗者约翰甚至在出生前就被圣灵充满。

3. God does not specifically say anything about the destiny of those who die without the opportunity for baptism. We cannot speculate and deliver ultimate judgments about them.

    神没有具体的说任何关于没有机会受洗就去世的人的结局。我们不能妄自猜测判断下结论。

4. We do know that all are in need of a Savior to forgive their sins. We also know that God is merciful and gracious and desires their salvation.

    我们的确知道，所有人都需要救主赦免他们的罪。我们也知道，神是宽大的，慈爱的，想要他们获得救赎。

    Psalm 25:6 – Remember, O Lord, Your great mercy and love, for they are from old.

    诗篇 25:6 —耶和华啊，求你记念你的怜悯和慈爱，因为这是亘古以来所常有的。

5. We commit those who die without the opportunity for baptism to the wisdom, justice and mercy of God. We can be sure that the God of grace will handle their destiny in exactly the right way.

    我们把没有机会受洗就去世的人交托给神智慧，公正，慈爱的手中。我们确信，满有恩典的神 会绝对恰当合适的处理他们的结局。

6. Christian parents of such children have the added comfort that their children had some contact with the Gospel through their mother and were committed to God in their prayers.

    有上述情况的基督徒的孩子，会得到加添的安慰----基督徒的孩子通过母亲，与福音产生某种接触，并且在基督徒父母的祷告中被交托给神。

Matthew 19:14 – Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

马太福音 19:14 —耶稣说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在天国的，正是这样的人。”

E. Parents are to make sure that they have their children baptized as soon as possible. Parents will place the urgency of their children becoming God's children ahead of other concerns in conducting baptism.

父母要确保孩子尽快受洗，在受洗这件事上，父母应该不顾其他考虑，首先确保自己的孩子成为神的儿女。

Ephesians 6:4 – Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.

以弗所书 6:4 —你们作父亲的，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒养育他们。

F. Parents who refuse to baptize their children and train them in God's Word severely damage them and can destroy them spiritually.

拒绝给孩子施洗，并且不按照神的话语教育孩子的父母，会严重损害甚至毁掉孩子的灵性成长。

1. Parents have a tremendous influence on and obligation toward the spiritual welfare of their children.

    父母对于孩子的灵性幸福健康有很大的影响和义务。

2. Parents can influence their children for a life of unbelief and an eternity in hell by failing in their duty to baptize them and instruct them in God's Word.

    父母可能因为没有尽义务给孩子施洗，没有尽义务用神的话语教育孩子，导致影响了孩子的一生，使孩子一生处于不信中，并且永久下地狱。

3. One cannot bring up children apart from the Gospel and expect them to be Christians. Even parents who have their children baptized can “starve” them spiritually by not continuing to feed their faith with God's Word. Regular worship, Bible teaching, family devotions, prayers and informal discussions of God's Word are all indispensible practices of every believer's life.

    人不能撇开福音抚养孩子，还期望孩子成为基督徒。即使是给孩子受洗的父母，也会让孩子的灵里“饥饿”,因为父母没有用神的话语继续滋养孩子的信心。经常的敬拜，学习圣经，家庭奉献，祷告，私下讨论神的话语，在每个信徒的生活里都是必不可少的。

4. Parents who choose to let their children grow up to make their own spiritual decisions are gambling with their children's salvation. To choose not to influence children for God is to choose to influence them against Him.

    那些选择让孩子长大以后自己做灵性方面的决定的父母，是在为孩子的得救打赌。为了神而选择不去影响孩子，就是选择让孩子背离忤逆神。

5. We must do what we can to reach the unbaptized with the Gospel in baptism and God's Word.

    我们必须竭尽所能，让未受洗的人接触福音，受洗。

### X. Baptism's Importance For Our Daily Lives 受洗对我们日常生活的意义

A. God's blessings in baptism have enduring value and benefit for our lives.

神在受洗里给予的祝福对我们的人生有持久的价值和益处。

Galatians 3:26-27, 29 – You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have been clothed with Christ. 29If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

加拉太书 3:26-27, 29 —

26所以，你们因信基督耶稣，都是神的儿子。27你们受洗归入基督的，都是披戴基督了。

29你们既属乎基督，就是亚伯拉罕的后裔，是照着应许承受产业的了。

B. God's grace in baptism gives us the confidence of knowing at all times that Christ is our Savior and that we are God's heaven-bound children.

神在受洗里给予的恩典使我们有信心在任何时候都知晓，基督是我们的救主，我们是神天堂绑定的儿女。

1 Corinthians 12:13 – For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.

哥林多前书12:13 – 我们不拘是犹太人，是希利尼人，是为奴的，是自主的，都从一位圣灵受洗，成了一个身体，饮于一位圣灵。

C. God's grace in baptism gives us the comfort of knowing that we are members together with other Christians in the Spirit-created fellowship of the Church.

神在施洗里给予的恩典使我们安心的知道，我们与其他基督徒一起，都是圣灵创建的教会大家庭的一员。

Romans 6:4, 6, 13 – 4We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead. 6For we know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—13Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness.

罗马书 6:4, 6, 13 —

4所以我们藉着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督藉着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。

6因为知道我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。

13也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具；倒要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神，并将肢体作义的器具献给神。

D. God's grace in baptism gives us a new life in Christ in which we share in the blessings of His saving work and receive strength and encouragement to set aside the control of sin and live in obedient service to God.

神在施洗里给予的恩典给予我们基督里的新生，在新生里我们可以享有基督救赎的祝福，而且获得力量，鼓舞，摆脱罪的控制，在生活里顺服神，服务神。

E. The faith worked by baptism must be nourished and fed through continual feeding on the Gospel in the Word and in the Sacrament of Holy Communion throughout life.

受洗仪式里获得的信心必须通过一生中不断的汲取福音的话语和圣餐仪式获得滋养。

Hymn 294: 1, 2 in Christian Worship: ”Baptized into Your Name Most Holy“

Baptized into Your name most holy, O Father, Son and Holy Ghost,

I claim a place, though weak and lowly, Among Your saints, Your chosen host,

Buried with Christ and dead to sin. Your Spirit now shall live within.

My loving Father, there You took me To be henceforth Your child and heir.

My faithful Savior, there You let me The fruit of all Your sorrows share.

O Holy Spirit, comfort me When threat'ning clouds around I see.
