You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out Your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.” The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.

    约伯记1:8-12 ——8耶和华问撒但说：“你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯没有？地上再没有人像他完全正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。” 9撒但回答耶和华说：“约伯敬畏　神岂是无故呢？ 10你岂不是四面圈上篱笆围护他和他的家，并他一切所有的吗？他手所做的都蒙你赐福；他的家产也在地上增多。11你且伸手毁他一切所有的，他必当面弃掉你。” 12耶和华对撒但说：“凡他所有的都在你手中，只是不可伸手加害于他。”于是撒但从耶和华面前退去。

    Hosea 5:10b, 14b, 15a – “I will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water… I will tear to pieces and go away… Then I will go back to my place until they admit their guilt.”

    10b我必将忿怒倒在他们身上，如水一般。

    神借苦难的折磨，惩罚非信徒拒绝悔改的罪。

    Psalm 73:3-5, 7-9, 14, 16-19 – For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills. From their callous hearts comes iniquity; their evil imaginations have no limits. They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression. Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments. When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny. Surely You place them on slippery ground; You cast them down to ruin. How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!

    诗篇 73:3-5, 7-9, 14, 16-19 —

    3我见恶人和狂傲人享平安，就心怀不平。4他们死的时候没有疼痛，他们的力气却也壮实。5他们不像别人受苦，也不像别人遭灾。

    7他们的眼睛因体胖而凸出；他们所得的过于心里所想的。8他们讥笑人，凭恶意说欺压人的话；他们说话自高。9他们的口亵渎上天；他们的舌毁谤全地。因为我终日遭灾难，每早晨受惩治。

    16我思索怎能明白这事，眼看实系为难。17等我进了神的圣所，思想他们的结局。18你实在把他们安在滑地，使他们掉在沉沦之中。19他们转眼之间成了何等的荒凉！他们被惊恐灭尽了。

    Psalm 37:38 – But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.

    诗篇 37:38 —至于犯法的人，必一同灭绝，恶人终必剪除。

4. The fact that God allows some wicked people to have relatively comfortable lives on earth does not mean that He will let them go unpunished.

    神让一些作恶的人可以有相对安逸的俗世生活，并不意味着神会让他们逃脱惩罚。

E. God's purposes in the suffering of Christians.

神让基督徒患难的目的

1. God has dramatically different purposes for permitting or placing afflictions on His believers:

    神准许或施加苦难折磨信徒，有显著不同的目的。

    Hebrews 12:2-3 – Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

    希伯来书 12:2-3 ——2仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣（或作“仰望那将真道创始成终的耶稣”）。他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。3那忍受罪人这样顶撞的，你们要思想，免得疲倦灰心。

2. God directs believers to look at their suffering in the light of Jesus Christ and His suffering and death for our salvation. Jesus reveals God's loving eternal purposes for them and helps them make proper sense of their suffering.

    神引导人将自己的苦难对照耶稣基督为救赎我们而受苦，遇难。耶稣的受苦揭示了神的大爱，神为人预备的永生计划，这帮助人正确理解自己的苦难。

    Psalm 119:67-71 – Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey your word. It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn Your decrees.

    诗篇 119:67-71 ——67我未受苦以先走迷了路，现在却遵守你的话。68你本为善，所行的也善，求你将你的律例教训我。69骄傲人编造谎言攻击我，我却要一心守你的训词。70他们心蒙脂油，我却喜爱你的律法。71我受苦是与我有益，为要使我学习你的律例。

3. God uses afflictions, not to punish believers, but to correct them when they sin so that they remain in faith and to teach them to obey Him and His Word more faithfully.

    神使用苦难的折磨，不是为了惩罚信徒，而是为了在信徒犯罪的时候，纠正他们的过犯，以便信徒保守信心，并且教导信徒更加忠实的顺服神和神的话语。

    2 Corinthians 12:7-10 – To keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

    哥林多后书 12:7--10 ——7又恐怕我因所得的启示甚大，就过于自高，所以有一根刺加在我肉体上，就是撒但的差役，要攻击我，免得我过于自高。8为这事，我三次求过主，叫这刺离开我。9他对我说，我的恩典够你用的。因为我的能力，是在人的软弱上显得完全。所以我更喜欢夸自己的软弱，好叫基督的能力覆庇我。10我为基督的缘故，就以软弱，凌辱，急难，逼迫，困苦，为可喜乐的。因我什么时候软弱，什么时候就刚强了。

    2 Corinthians 1:9 – Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.

    哥林多后书1:9 —自己心里也断定是必死的，叫我们不靠自己，只靠叫死人复活的神。

4. God uses afflictions to protect believers from their sinful pride and to teach them to rely on God's power for their blessing.

    神使用苦难保护信徒远离罪性的骄傲自大，教导信徒依靠神的大能获得恩惠。

    1 Peter 1:6-7 – In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.

    彼得前书 1:6-7 ——6因此，你们是大有喜乐。但如今在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁，7叫你们的信心既被试验，就比那被火试验仍然能坏的金子更显宝贵，可以在耶稣基督显现的时候，得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。

    Isaiah 48:10 – See, I have refined you, though not as silver: I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.

    以赛亚书 48:10 —我熬炼你，却不像熬炼银子；你在苦难的炉中，我拣选你。

5. God uses affliction to test believers and to purify their faith of imperfections （Note the old practice of refining gold by means of fire）。

    神用苦难的折磨试炼信徒，净化他们信心里的不完全。（注意古人以火炼金的做法）

    Hebrews 12:7-11 – Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as His children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in His holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

    希伯来书 12:7-11 ——7你们所忍受的，是神管教你们，待你们如同待儿子。焉有儿子不被父亲管教的呢？8管教原是众子所共受的，你们若不受管教，就是私子，不是儿子了。9再者，我们曾有生身的父管教我们，我们尚且敬重他；何况万灵的父，我们岂不更当顺服他得生吗？10生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们；惟有万灵的父管教我们，是要我们得益处，使我们在他的圣洁上有分。11凡管教的事，当时不觉得快乐，反觉得愁苦，后来却为那经练过的人结出平安的果子，就是义。

    Proverbs 3:11-12 – My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent His rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those He loves as a father the son he delights in.

    箴言 3:11-12 ——11我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教（或作“惩治”），也不可厌烦他的责备。12因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备，正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。

6. God uses afflictions to discipline believers for their benefit now and forever.

    神用苦难的折磨管教信徒，为的是他们现在和将来永远的益处。

    Romans 8:18, 23 – I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

    罗马书 8:18, 23 —

    18我想，现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀，就不足介意了。

    23不但如此，就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的，也是自己心里叹息，等候得着儿子的名分，乃是我们的身体得赎。

7. God uses afflictions to help believers recognize the greater value of His spiritual and eternal blessings and to help Christians long for the joy and perfection of heaven.

    神藉苦难的折磨，帮助信徒认识到信徒自己灵性和永生的恩惠的价值，并且促使基督徒渴望天堂的喜乐和完全。

    Psalm 88:1, 3, 15-18 – O LORD, the God who saves me, day and night I cry out before you. For my soul is full of trouble and my life draws near the grave. From my youth I have been afflicted and close to death; I have suffered Your terrors and am in despair. Your wrath has swept over me; Your terrors have destroyed me. All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me. You have taken my companions and loved ones from me; the darkness is my closest friend.

    诗篇 88:1, 3, 15-18 ——

    1（可拉后裔的诗歌，就是以斯拉人希幔的训诲诗，交与伶长。调用麻哈拉利暗俄。）耶和华拯救我的神啊，我昼夜在你面前呼吁。

    3因为我心里满了患难，我的性命临近阴间。

    15我自幼受苦，几乎死亡；我受你的惊恐，甚至慌张。16你的烈怒漫过我身；你的惊吓把我剪除。17这些终日如水环绕我，一齐都来围困我。18你把我的良朋密友隔在远处，使我所认识的人进入黑暗里。

8. In His wisdom God permits especially heavy afflictions on some of His believers.

    在神的智慧里，神准许一些特别严重的苦难折磨神的某些信徒。

    Lamentations 3:22 – Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail.

    耶利米哀歌 3:22 —我们不至消灭，是出于耶和华诸般的慈爱，是因他的怜悯不致断绝。

    1 Corinthians 10:13– No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.

    哥林多前书 10:13 ——你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。

9. In His mercy God will not permit more afflictions on a believer than the believer with God's help can bear.

    在神的怜悯中，神不会准许信徒承受在神的帮助下还不能承受的苦难折磨。

    Psalm 34:19 – A righteous man may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all.

    诗篇 34:19 —义人多有苦难，但耶和华救他脱离这一切，

    Lamentations 3:31-33 – For men are not cast off by the Lord forever. Though He brings grief, He will show compassion, so great is His unfailing love. For He does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.

    耶利米哀歌 3:31-33 ——31因为主必不永远丢弃人。32主虽使人忧愁，还要照他诸般的慈爱发怜悯。33因他并不甘心使人受苦、使人忧愁。

10. In His unfailing love, God delivers His believers from their afflictions when those afflictions have served their purpose in their lives.

    在神不止息的爱里，当这些苦难已经在信徒生活里发挥了应有的作用时，神会拯救信徒脱离苦难。

F. Responding to sufferings

如何应对苦难

Proverbs 3:11 – My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent His rebuke.

箴言 3:11 —我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教（或作“惩治”），也不可厌烦他的责备。

Lamentations 3:38-40 – Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come? Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins? Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD

耶利米哀歌3:38-40 ——38祸福不都出于至高者的口吗？39活人因自己的罪受罚，为何发怨言呢？40我们当深深考察自己的行为，再归向耶和华。

1. God does not want us to resent our suffering or complain about God's dealing with us.

    神不愿我们怨恨自己的苦难，或者抱怨神对待我们的方式。

2. Instead, He wants us to search ourselves, learn from our sufferings and turn to Him for comfort and strength.

    神想要我们自己去思索寻求，从我们的痛苦里学习，寻求神，到神那里获得安慰和力量。

    1 Peter 4:12, 19 – Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.

    彼得前书 4:12, 19 —
    
    12亲爱的弟兄啊，有火炼的试验临到你们，不要以为奇怪（似乎是遭遇非常的事），

    19所以，那照神旨意受苦的人要一心为善，将自己灵魂交与那信实的造化之主。

    1 Peter 2:21--23 – To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps. When they hurled their insults at Him, He did not retaliate; when He suffered, He made no threats. Instead, He entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.

    彼得前书 2:21-23 ——21你们蒙召原是为此，因基督也为你们受过苦，给你们留下榜样，叫你们跟随他的脚踪行。22他并没有犯罪，口里也没有诡诈。 23他被骂不还口，受害不说威吓的话，只将自己交托那按公义审判人的主。

3. God doesn't want us to be shocked or surprised by our sufferings.

    神不愿我们因为自己的苦难受到惊吓。

4. Instead He wants us to commit ourselves to His grace, endure our sufferings with Christ-like patience and wait for His deliverance.

For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.

    哥林多后书 1:3-5 ——3愿颂赞归与我们的主耶稣基督的父神，就是发慈悲的父，赐各样安慰的神。4我们在一切患难中，他就安慰我们，叫我们能用神所赐的安慰，去安慰那遭各样患难的人。5我们既多受基督的苦楚，就靠基督多得安慰。

5. God also wants us to receive His comfort in Christ when we suffer and then share that comfort with others who are troubled.

### II. Death 死亡

A. God tells us about three kinds of death in His Word:

1. Physical death which is separation from the physical blessing of God.

    肉体的死亡（与神赐予的肉体的恩惠隔绝）

2. Spiritual death which is separation from the spiritual blessing of God （unbelief）。

    灵里的死亡（与神赐予的灵里的恩惠隔绝，即不信）

3. Eternal death which separation from the eternal blessings of God （damnation）。

箴言 24:19-20 ——19不要为作恶的心怀不平，也不要嫉妒恶人，20因为恶人终不得善报，恶人的灯，也必熄灭。

I. Unbelievers die with no prospect of a blessed eternity. Christ-less hopes they hold to （such as reincarnation, getting to heaven because of their own goodness, ceasing to exist after death） will prove to be false and empty.

非信徒死去时没有任何永生恩惠的指望。他们抓住非基督的指望（比如轮回说，因为自己的好行为才能进天堂， 人死如灯灭等），而这些指望将会证明是错误，空洞的。

Psalm 31:15a – My times are in Your hands.

以赛亚书 57:1-2 ——1义人死亡，无人放在心上；虔诚人被收去，无人思念。这义人被收去是免了将来的祸患。2他们得享（原文作”进入“）平安。素行正直的，各人在坟里（原文作”床上“）安歇。

K. God may take the life of a believer at a young age to spare him/her from future evil.

神可能会结束一个年轻信徒的生命，以免此人以后的祸患。

传道书 8:7,8b —

7他不知道将来的事，因为将来如何，谁能告诉他呢？

Psalm 39:4 – ”Show me, O Lord, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.

3. Many people have made false predictions about the time of Christ's return.

    很多人错误的预言了基督的再来。

Matthew 24:3-14 – As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?” Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. ”Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of Me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

马太福音24:3-14 ——3 耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗地来说，请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和世界的末了，有什么预兆呢？ 4 耶稣回答说，你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。 5 因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说，我是基督，并且要迷惑许多人。 6 你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌。因为这些事是必须有的。只是末期还没有到。 7 民要攻打民，国要攻打国。多处必有饥荒，地震。 8 这都是灾难的起头。（灾难原文作生产之难）。 9 那时，人要把你们陷在患难里，也要杀害你们。你们又要为我的名，被万民恨恶。 10 那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此陷害，彼此恨恶。 11 且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。 12 只因不法的事增多，许多人的爱心，才渐渐冷淡了。 13 惟有忍耐到底的，必然得救。 14 这天国的福音，要传遍天下，对万民作见证，然后末期才来到。

G. Jesus gives signs that point to His return. They can be grouped in three basic categories.

关于基督再来，耶稣给了我们一些信号。可分为3个基本的类别：

1. Signs in nature: earthquakes, floods, eclipses of the sun and moon.

    大自然的信号：地震，洪水，日食，月食。

2. Signs in the lives of people and nations: wars, famines, plagues, wickedness.

    人民的生活和国家的信号：战争，饥荒，瘟疫，罪恶。

3. Signs in the realm of religion: false teachers, persecutions, many falling away from the true faith, Christian love growing cold, the growing influence of the Anti-Christ, the preaching of the gospel throughout the world.

    宗教领域的信号：假的教导者；迫害；很多人背离真道，从真信跌倒；基督的爱变冷漠；反基督，反世界范围内传遍福音的影响增大；

4. The signs of Christ's return are being fulfilled throughout history.

    纵观历史，基督再来的迹象一直获得应验。

Matthew 24:21-25 – For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again. If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of time.

马太福音 24:21-25 ——21 因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头，直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。 22 若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的。只是为选民，那日子必减少了。 23 那时若有人对你们说，基督在这里。或说，基督在那里，你们不要信。 24 因为假基督，假先知，将要起来，显大神迹，大奇事。倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。 25 看哪，我预先告诉你们了。

H. A relatively brief time of great distress will immediately precede Jesus' return.

基督再来前，会有一小段时间的大灾难。

I. God does not teach that there will be a special 1,000 year rule of Christ on earth or time of prosperity for the Church prior to Christ's final coming.

神没有教导，在基督再来之前会有基督在这世上1000年的统治期，或者会有教会的繁荣。

2 Peter 3:3-4 – First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, “Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”

彼得后书 3:3-4 ——3第一要紧的，该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人，随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说：4 “主要降临的应许在哪里呢？因为从列祖睡了以来，万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。”

Revelation 6:15-17 – Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”

启示录 6:15-17 ——15 地上的君王，臣宰，将军，富户，壮士，和一切为奴的，自主的，都藏在山洞，和岩石穴里。 16 向山和岩石说，倒在我们身上吧，把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目，和羔羊的忿怒。 17 因为他们忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？

J. Some unbelievers scoff at the idea of Jesus' Second Coming. However, Jesus will return to the eternal regret of all unbelievers who must face His fierce anger over their sin and unbelief.

有些非信徒讥诮耶稣的再来。然而，耶稣确实会再来，这会使所有非信徒永远后悔，因为他们必将面对神降在他们罪和不信的狂怒。

Luke 21:28 – When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.“

路加福音 21:28 —一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首，因为你们得赎的日子近了。”

2 Peter 3:11-12a – Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.

彼得后书 3:11-12a ——11这一切既然都要如此销化，你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔，12a切切仰望神的日子来到。

哥林多前书 15:51-52 ——51我如今把一件奥秘的事告诉你们：我们不是都要睡觉，乃是都要改变，52就在一霎时，眨眼之间，号筒末次吹响的时候。因号筒要响，死人要复活，成为不朽坏的，我们也要改变。

1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 – Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage each other with these words.

帖撒罗尼迦前书 4:13-18 ——13 论到睡了的人，我们不愿意弟兄们不知道，恐怕你们忧伤，像那些没有指望的人一样。 14 我们若信耶稣死而复活了，那已经在耶稣里睡了的人，神也必将他与耶稣一同带来。 15 我们现在照主的话告诉你们一件事。我们这活着还存留到主降临的人，断不能在那已经睡了的人之先。 16 因为主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音，和天使长的声音，又有神的号吹响。那在基督里死了的人必先复活。 17 以后我们这活着还存留的人，必和他们一同被提到云里，在空中与主相遇。这样，我们就要和主永远同在。 18 所以你们当用这些话彼此劝慰。

Matthew 25:31-46 – “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. ”Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited Me in, I needed clothes and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you came to visit Me.' “Then the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? When did we see You a stranger and invite You in, or needing clothes and clothe You? When did we see You sick or in prison and go to visit You?' ”The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever You did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, You did for me.' “Then He will say to those on his left, 'Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite Me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me.' ”They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help You?' “He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.' ”Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.“

马太福音 25:31-46 ——31 当人子在他荣耀里同着众天使降临的时候，要坐在他荣耀的宝座上。 32 万民都要聚集在他面前。他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊、山羊一般。 33 把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。 34 于是王要向那右边的说，你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。 35 因为我饿了，你们给我吃。渴了，你们给我喝。我作客旅，你们留我住。 36 我赤身露体，你们给我穿。我病了，你们看顾我。我在监里，你们来看我。 37 义人就回答说，主阿，我们什么时候见你饿了给你吃，渴了给你喝？ 38 什么时候见你作客旅留你住，或是赤身露体给你穿？ 39 又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢？ 40 王要回答说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。 41 王又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。 42 因为我饿了，你们不给我吃。渴了，你们不给我喝。 43 我作客旅，你们不留我住。我赤身露体，你们不给我穿。我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。 44 他们也要回答说，主阿，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢？ 45 王要回答说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不作在我身上了。 46 这些人要往永刑里去。那些义人要往永生里去。

2. All the dead are resurrected. The believing dead begin to ascend into the sky to meet and greet the returning Savior.

    所有死人复活。死去的信徒开始升到空中，去问候再来的基督，和基督见面。

3. The believers who are left on earth are given ”glorified bodies“ and they, too, begin their ascent into the heavens.

    留在这世上的信徒获得”荣耀的身体“,也开始升到天堂去。

### VII. Hell 地狱

A. The Bible's teaching of an eternal hell is a tragically real, yet highly unpopular subject.

圣经关于永久地狱的教导，是非常悲惨，确实是真的，然而非常的难以接受的。

Luke 16:23-24 – In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'

路加福音 16:23-24 ——23他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，24就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。'

Matthew 22:13 – ”Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

马太福音 22:13 —于是王对使唤的人说：’捆起他的手脚来，把他丢在外边的黑暗里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。‘

B. Hell is a place of endless torment full of pain, despair, and helpless fury.

地狱是个充满无休止的痛苦，绝望，无助愤怒的折磨的地方。

2 Thessalonians 1:8-9 – He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power.

帖撒罗尼迦后书 1:8-9 ——8要报应那不认识神和那不听从我主耶稣福音的人。9他们要受刑罚，就是永远沉沦，离开主的面和他权能的荣光。

Psalm 38:4, 8 – My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.

诗篇 38:4,8 —

4我的罪孽高过我的头，如同重担叫我担当不起。

8我被压伤，身体疲倦，因心里不安，我就唉哼。

C. Hell is eternal exclusion from God's merciful presence. The worst part of hell is having an eternally tormenting conscience which must suffer eternally without any hope of God's love and mercy coming to the rescue.

地狱就是永远与神慈爱的存在隔绝。地狱最糟糕之处就是，良心无休止的受折磨，永久受苦，没有任何神的爱与仁慈来拯救的指望。

Luke 12:4-5 – I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him.

路加福音 12:4-5 ——4我的朋友，我对你们说：那杀身体以后不能再做什么的，不要怕他们。5我要指示你们当怕的是谁，当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们：正要怕他。

D. Jesus calls people to revere God who can put them into hell and to trust in Him so they do not go there.

耶稣劝诫人们敬畏神，因为神有权柄把人丢在地狱，要信靠神，为的是不下地狱。

### VIII. Heaven 天堂

Philippians 1:23 – I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far:

腓立比书 1:23 —我正在两难之间，情愿离世与基督同在，因为这是好得无比的。

1 Corinthians 13:12 – Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

哥林多前书 13:12 —我们如今仿佛对着镜子观看，模糊不清（“模糊不清”原文作“如同猜谜”），到那时，就要面对面了。我如今所知道的有限，到那时就全知道，如同主知道我一样。

Psalm 17:15 – And I--in righteousness I will see Your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing Your likeness.

Revelation 7:15 – Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tent over them.

启示录 7:15 —所以，他们在神宝座前，昼夜在他殿中事奉他。坐宝座的要用帐幕覆庇他们。

Revelation 5:9 – And they sang a new song: “You （Jesus） are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because You were slain, and with your blood You purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.”

    他们会有荣耀成为神祝福的子民。

E. Former relationships in heaven.

天堂里以前的人际关系

1. We may wonder: Will we know our believing friends and relatives in heaven and will we have the same relationship we had with them on earth?

    我们会问： ”我们在天堂会找到我们的信徒朋友和亲戚，并且会有和在尘世一样的关系吗？ “

2. People may also wonder: Will we miss and be sad over unbelieving friends and relatives who went to hell?

    人们也会问：”我们会想念不信的亲戚和朋友，为不信的朋友和亲戚最后下地狱感到悲伤吗？“

    Luke 20:34-36 – Jesus replied, ”The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.

    路加福音 20:34-36 ——34耶稣说：“这世界的人有娶有嫁；35惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁，36因为他们不能再死，和天使一样；既是复活的人，就为神的儿子。

As He approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, His heart went out to her and He said, ”Don't cry.“ Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, ”Young man, I say to you, get up!“ The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

    路加福音 7:11-15 ——11 过了不多时，有古卷作次日耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。 12 将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来。这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇。有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。 13 主看见那寡妇就怜悯她，对她说，不要哭。 14 于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说，少年人，我吩咐你起来。 15 那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。

6. From Jesus' practice of reuniting people when He raised people on earth, it seems that He will reunite believing family members and friends in heaven.
