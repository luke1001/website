请复习第九课的课后作业题

### I. God Gives The Law 神设立律法

Isaiah 33:22 – For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; it is He who will save us.

以赛亚书 33:22 —因为耶和华是审判我们的，耶和华是给我们设律法的，耶和华是我们的王，他必拯救我们。

Psalm 19:7-10 – The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple. The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes. The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous. They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

诗篇 19:7-10 ——7耶和华的律法全备，能苏醒人心；耶和华的法度确定，能使愚人有智慧；8耶和华的训词正直，能快活人的心；耶和华的命令清洁，能明亮人的眼目；9耶和华的道理洁净，存到永远 ;耶和华的典章真实，全然公义。10都比金子可羡慕，且比极多的精金可羡慕；比蜜甘甜，且比蜂房下滴的蜜甘甜。

A. God gives His Law to people as a precious, helpful gift of His love.

因着爱，上帝将律法作为宝贵的，有帮助的礼物赐给人们

Romans 2:14-15 – Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.

罗马书2:14-15 ——14没有律法的外邦人，若顺着本性行律法上的事，他们虽然没有律法，自己就是自己的律法。15这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里，他们是非之心同作见证，并且他们的思念互相较量，或以为是，或以为非。

B. God gives people a natural knowledge of His Law when He creates them （Natural Law）。 Since humanity's fall into sin, this once perfect knowledge has been weakened and flawed so that it is incomplete and even misguided in some points.

当神创造人的时候，他赐予人关于律法的自然知识（自然法则）。自从人堕入罪中，这曾完美无瑕的知识被削弱，变为有瑕疵的，因而不再完全，在某些地方甚至被误导。

Exodus 24:12 – The Lord said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and commands I have written for their instruction.”

出埃及记24:12 —耶和华对摩西说：“你上山到我这里来，住在这里，我要将石版并我所写的律法和诫命赐给你，使你可以教训百姓。”

Deuteronomy 10:4 – The Lord wrote on these tablets what He had written before, the Ten Commandments He had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me.

申命记10:4 —耶和华将那大会之日、在山上从火中所传与你们的十条诫，照先前所写的，写在这版上，将版交给我了。

Romans 2:18 – If you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;

罗马书2:18 —既从律法中受了教训，就晓得神的旨意，也能分别是非。

C. God also gives us His Law by having it written in His Word （Written law）。 By following the written Law we can know exactly what His moral will for us is.

上帝也将他话语中的律法书写下来赐给我们（成文律法）。通过遵行这种成文律法，我们会完全明白神对我们的道德旨意是什么。

Leviticus 19:2b, 3a, 11, 37 – “Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy. Each of you must respect his mother and father. ”‘Do not steal. “'Do not lie. ”'Do not deceive one another. “'Keep all my decrees and all my laws and follow them. I am the Lord.’”

利未记19:2b,3a,11,37 —

19:2b你们要圣洁，因为我耶和华你们的神是圣洁的。3a你们各人都当孝敬父母。

11你们不可偷盗，不可欺骗，也不可彼此说谎。

37你们要谨守遵行我一切的律例、典章。我是耶和华。

D. In the Law, God expresses His holy will for our lives.

在律法中，神为我们的生命的缘故表达他圣洁的旨意

1. He tells us how He wants us to be and what He wants us to do and not do.

    他告诉我们他想让我们成为怎样的人，他想让我们做的事情以及禁止我们做的事情。

2. He demands that we obey His will completely.

    他要求我们完全遵守他的旨意。

Matthew 22:37-39 – Jesus replied, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'

马太福音22:37-39 ——37耶稣对他说：”你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主你的神。38这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。39其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。“

Romans 13:10b – Love is the fulfillment of the law.

罗马书13:10b —爱就完全了律法。

E. In all the Law, God's great requirement of us is to love.

在所有的律法中，神对我们最大的要求就是爱。

1. He wants us to love Him, above all, and also all other people.

    他想要我们爱他，最重要的是，也爱其他所有人。

2. He wants us to love with wholehearted, self-giving devotion.

    他想让我们全心全意去爱，无私奉献。

### II. The Purposes Of The Law 律法的目的

Matthew 19:16 – Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, ”Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?“

马太福音19:16 —有一个人来见耶稣说：”夫子，我该做什么善事才能得永生？“

A. Some think they can get to heaven by keeping the Law.

有的人认为他们如果遵行了律法就能上天堂

Matthew 19:17b – If you want to enter life, obey the commandments.

马太福音19:17b —你若要进入永生，就当遵守诫命。

Romans 3:12 – All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”

罗马书3:12 —都是偏离正路，一同变为无用。没有行善的，连一个也没有。

Galatians 3:10 – All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.

加拉太书3:10 -凡以行律法为本的，都是被咒诅的，因为经上记着：”凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。“

B. A person could get to heaven if he/she kept the Law perfectly. No one, except Jesus, can and has done this. Our failure puts us under God's curse. The Law is not a means by which people can save themselves.

一个人如果完美遵行了律法就能上天堂。除了耶稣基督，没有人能，也没有人曾经这么做过。我们的失败使我们处于神的咒诅之下。律法并不是人能施行自我拯救的方式。

C. God has given His Law for three special purposes.

上帝设立律法是为了三个特殊目的。

1 Timothy 1:9-10a – We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers.

提摩太前书1:9-10a ——9因为律法不是为义人设立的，乃是为不法和不服的，不虔诚和犯罪的，不圣洁和恋世俗的，弑父母和杀人的，10a行淫和亲男色的，抢人口和说谎话的。

1. The Law serves as a curb or a fence to hold the sin of all people in check and so preserve some order in the world.

    律法充当了勒马绳和栅栏，控制所有人的罪，从而使这世界的秩序得以维持。

    Romans 3:19-20 – Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the while world held accountable to God. Therefore no one will be declared righteous in His sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.

    罗马书3:19-20 ——19我们晓得律法上的话，都是对律法以下之人说的，好塞住各人的口，叫普世的人都伏在神审判之下。20所以凡有血气的，没有一个因行律法能在神面前称义，因为律法本是叫人知罪。

    Romans 7:7b, 13b – ”I would not have known what sin was except through the law… In order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.“

    罗马书7:7b,13b —

    7b只是非因律法，我就不知何为罪。

    13b叫我死的乃是罪。但罪藉着那良善的叫我死，就显出真是罪，叫罪因着诫命更显出是恶极了。

2. The Law serves as a mirror to show all people their sin, its consequences and their inability to save themselves.

    律法充当了镜子，显出所有人的罪及其后果与人们自我拯救的无能为力。

    Psalm 119:35 – Direct me in the path of Your commands, for there I find delight.

    诗篇119:35—求你叫我遵行你的命令，因为这是我所喜乐的。

    John 14:15 – ”If you love Me, you will obey what I command.

    约翰福音14:15 —你们若爱我，就必遵守我的命令。

3. The Law serves as a guide for Christians to show them how to express their love for God in ways that please the Lord.

    律法充当了基督徒的向导，向他们表明如何用神喜悦的方式向神表达爱意。

### III. Our Relationship To The Law 我们与律法的关系

Romans 8:7 – The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.

罗马书8:7— 原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇，因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。

A. By nature, all people hate the Law and rebel against it.

就本性而言，所有人都恨恶律法并反抗律法。

Galatians 3:10 – All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.

加拉太书3:10- 凡以行律法为本的，都是被咒诅的，因为经上记着：”凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。“

B. By nature, all people are condemned and cursed by the Law for their sins.

就本性而言，因着罪，所有人都被律法定罪并咒诅。

Romans 7:12, 13b – So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. In order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.

罗马书7:12,13b —

12这样看来，律法是圣洁的，诫命也是圣洁、公义、良善的。

13b叫我死的乃是罪。但罪藉着那良善的叫我死，就显出真是罪，叫罪因着诫命更显出是恶极了。

Galatians 3:23-24 – Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.

加拉太书3:23-24 ——23但这因信得救的理还未来以先，我们被看守在律法之下，直圈到那将来的真道显明出来。24这样，律法是我们蒙训的师傅，引我们到基督那里，使我们因信称义。

C. With convicting power the Law reveals our sins, their spiritually deadly consequences and our need for a Savior.

律法有权揭露出我们的罪，罪在灵性上的必死的后果以及我们对救主的需要。

Galatians 3:13 – Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: ”Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.“

加拉太书3:13 —基督既为我们受了咒诅，就赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅，因为经上记着：”凡挂在木头上都是被咒诅的。“

Romans 10:4 – Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

罗马书10:4 —律法的 总结就是基督，使凡信他的都 得着义。

Romans 7:4 – So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.

罗马书7:4 —我的弟兄们，这样说来，你们藉着基督的身体，在律法上也是死了，叫你们归于别人，就是归于那从死里复活的，叫我们结果子给神。

D. By bringing people to faith in Jesus, God releases them from the punishing consequences and controlling power of the Law.

借着将人们带入耶稣的信仰中，上帝把人们从受惩罚的后果与罪的权势中释放出来。

Psalm 119:70b, 72, 97 – But I delight in Your law. 72 The law from Your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of silver and gold. 97Oh, how I love Your law! I meditate on it all day long.

诗篇119:70b,72,97 —

70b我却喜爱你的律法。

72你口中的训言与我有益，胜于千万的金银。

97我何等爱慕你的律法，终日不住地思想。

E. God leads believers to love and cherish the Law and take it to heart.

上帝带领信徒喜爱并珍视律法，将律法谨记在心。

1 John 4:19 – We love because He first loved us.

约翰一书4:19 —我们爱，因为神先爱我们。

1 John 5:3 – This is love for God: to obey His commands. And His commands are not burdensome.

约翰一书5:3 —我们遵守神的诫命，这就是爱他了，并且他的诫命不是难守的。

Psalm 119:32 – I run in the path of Your commands, for You have set my heart free.

诗篇119:32 —你开广我心的时候，我就往你命令的道上直奔。

F. God leads His believers to want to obey the Law for the right reason, out of thankfulness for His saving love in Christ.

上帝带领他的信徒 ,使他们想要因正确的原因遵行律法，就是感谢神通过耶稣基督拯救我们的爱。

Ezekiel 36:27 – And I will put My Spirit in you and move you to follow My decrees and be careful to keep My laws.

以西结书36:27 —我必将我的灵放在你们里面。又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。

Philippians 2:13 – For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.

上帝赐圣灵给他的信徒，使他们有意愿、有上帝喜悦的渴望和能力去遵行律法。

### IV. The Ten Commandments 十条诫

Exodus 20:1-17 – And God spoke all these words: ”I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. “You shall have no other gods before me. ”You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name. “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

出埃及记20:1-17 ——1 神吩咐这一切的话说：2 「我是耶和华你的神，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。3 「除了我以外，你不可有别的神。4 「不可为自己雕刻偶像，也不可做什么形像彷佛上天、下地，和地底下、水中的百物。5 不可跪拜那些像，也不可事奉他，因为我耶和华你的神是忌邪的神。恨我的，我必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三四代；6 爱我、守我诫命的，我必向他们发慈爱，直到千代。 7 「不可妄称耶和华你神的名；因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪。 8 「当纪念安息日，守为圣日。 9 六日要劳碌做你一切的工， 10 但第七日是向耶和华你神当守的安息日。这一日你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜，并你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做； 11 因为六日之内，耶和华造天、地、海，和其中的万物，第七日便安息，所以耶和华赐福与安息日，定为圣日。 12 「当孝敬父母，使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐你的地上得以长久。 13 「不可杀人。 14 「不可奸淫。 15 「不可偷盗。 16 「不可作假见证陷害人。 17 「不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。」

Deuteronomy 10:4 – The Lord wrote on these tablets what He had written before, the Ten Commandments He had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me.

申命记10:4 —耶和华将那大会之日、在山上从火中所传与你们的十条诫，照先前所写的，写在这版上，将版交给我了。

No one can deliver out of My hand.  When I act, who can reverse it?”

以赛亚书 43:10b-13 ——10b在我以前没有真神，在我以后也必没有。11惟有我是耶和华，除我以外没有救主。12我曾指示，我曾拯救，我曾说明，并且在你们中间没有别神。所以耶和华说：“你们是我的见证，我也是神。”13自从有日子以来，我就是神，谁也不能救人脱离我手。我要行事谁能阻止呢？
