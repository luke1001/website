What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.”

    雅各书4:13-15 ——13嗐！你们有话说，今天明天我们要往某城里去，在那里住一年，作买卖得利。14其实明天如何，你们还不知道。你们的生命是什么呢。你们原来是一片云雾，出现少时就不见了。15你们只当说，主若愿意，我们就可以活着，也可以作这事，或作那事。

Hymn 407:1 – 3 in Christian Worship: ”O Lord, You Have in Your Pure Grace“

在敬拜时唱赞美诗407:1-3:”主啊，在你圣洁的恩典中“

O Lord, You have in Your pure grace

Made shine on us a Father's face:

Arise, Your holy name make known;

Take up Your power and reign alone;

On earth, in us, let Your pure will

Be done as angels do it still.

主啊，在你圣洁的恩典中

你使慈父的面容向我们闪现

扬升，你使生命广传；

唯有你的力量

在地上统治我们

愿你圣洁的旨意

在地上如同天使行在天上

O King and Father, kind and dread,

Give us this day our daily bread;

Forgive us, who have learned to bless

Our enemies, all trespasses;

Spare us temptation; let us be

From Satan set forever free.

我主我王啊，善良与威严并存

你赐给我们日用的饮食

宽恕我们，因我们已学会祝福

我们的敌人，所有的侵犯

试探我们

让我们永远从撒旦手中释放出来

Yours is the kingdom; unto You

We bow the knee in homage true,

And Yours the power, no power is there

That stands against You anywhere.

The glory Yours, by every tongue

Your praise shall be forever sung!

天国是你的；

带着真实的敬意，我们向你屈膝

力量是你的

在你之外别无其他

荣耀是你的，

众口永远传扬你的颂赞！
