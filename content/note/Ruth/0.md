#### Israel in the time of the Judges 士师时代的以色列地图

![](/images/note/Ruth/Introduction 1.png#center)

The book of Ruth is a beautiful story. It presents divine and human love working next to each other in perfect harmony. It is about an ordinary family whose members suffered many losses, but God watched over them. The book is named after one of its main characters, a young woman of Moab, Ruth, the great-grandmother of King David and an ancestress of Jesus. 

路得记这卷书讲述了一个美丽的故事。它展现了神性的爱和人的爱相互完美和谐地运作。故事关于一个普通的家庭，家庭成员遭遇很多损失，但神看顾保守他们。这卷书以书中主人公的名字为书名，这位主人公就是年轻的摩押妇女，路得，她是大卫王的曾祖母，耶稣的祖先。

The events in Ruth happened over 3000 years ago in the time of the "judges", before there was a king ruling Israel's people. Jewish tradition attributes the writer of Ruth, Judges and 1 and 2 Samuel to the prophet Samuel. 

路得的故事发生于3000多年以前，在君王统治以色列民之前的士师时代。根据犹太人传统，认为先知撒母耳就是路得记，士师记，撒母耳记上，下卷的作者。

Ruth's complete loyalty to the Israelite family into which she had been received by marriage and her total devotion to her desolate mother-in-law mark her as a true daughter of Israel and a worthy ancestress of David. Her example exemplifies the truth that participation in the coming kingdom of God is decided, not by blood and birth, but by the conformity of one's life to the will of God through the "obedience that comes from faith" (Ro 1:5). Her place in the ancestry of David signifies that all nations will be represented in the kingdom of David's greater Son. Think of it, in the Old Testament, God wanted it to be made clear, that all people, not just Jews were included in His promise.

路得籍着婚姻被以色列家庭接纳，而她对以色列家庭的绝对忠诚和她对孤苦伶仃的婆婆的完全热爱使她成为以色列真正的女儿，从而无愧为大卫王的祖先。她的例子显示了决定是否与即将到来的神的国度有份的因素不是凭血缘和出身关系，而是凭着“信服真道”（罗马书1:5）一生合神心意。她成为大卫王祖先的身份说明万民将在大卫王后裔的国度中成为代表。想想看，在旧约中，神清楚地表明不只是犹太人而是包括所有人在他的应许之中。

The book begins with a famine in Judah. Elimelech, Naomi's husband, was from the town of Bethlehem in Judah and belonged to the clan of Ephrath, which was the name of Bethlehem where Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin. Genesis 35:19 "So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is Bethlehem)". A well known reference to both Ephrath and Bethlehem is found in Micah"s prophecy of the Savior's birthplace. Micah 5:2 "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."  Elimelech decided to move his family to Moab so they could find food. Moab was on the opposite side of the Dead Sea and was a separate state.  Moab was at a higher elevation so it is possible for rain to fall on it after bypassing Judah's lower elevation. Moabites were cousins to the Hebrews through Lot, Abrahams nephew (Sodom and Gomorrah). Moabs though, worshipped false gods.

本书一开始讲犹大地遭遇饥荒。拿俄米的丈夫，以利米勒，来自于犹大地的伯利恒，属于以法他支派，以法他的意思是伯利恒，就是拉结难产生下便雅悯去世的地方。创世纪35:19拉 结 死 了 ， 葬 在 以 法 他 的 路 旁 ；（以 法 他 就 是 伯 利 恒）众人周知的参考经文是在弥迦书中预言了救主出身地以法他和伯利恒。弥迦书5:2	伯 利 恒 、 以 法 他 啊 ， 你 在 犹 大 诸 城 中 为 小 ， 将 来 必 有 一 位 从 你 那 里 出 来 ， 在 以 色 列 中 为 我 作 掌 权 的 ； 他 的 根 源 从 亘 古 ， 从 太 初 就 有 。以利米勒为了寻找粮食决定搬家到摩押。摩押地在死海对面，是个独立的民族。摩押地势较高，因此可能是雨水绕过犹大地较低的地方落到摩押地。摩押人是亚伯拉罕的侄子罗得（所多玛与蛾摩拉）的后代，是希伯来人的表兄弟。但是摩押人敬拜假神。

Have you or anyone you known ever lived during a famine? Think about it - no food for you or your family. How would you survive?


你或任何你认识的人曾经在饥荒中生活过吗？ 思考这种情况—— 你和你的家人没有食物。你们怎样生存？
