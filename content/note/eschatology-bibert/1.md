B. What is hell like?
地狱什么样？
1 Peter 3:18b-20a – He (Christ) was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit,
through which He went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago
when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.
《彼得前书》3：18b－20a——18b按着肉体说，他被治死；按着灵性说，他复活了。19他藉这灵曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听，20就是那从前在挪亚预备方舟、神容忍等待的时候，不信从的人。
1. After physical death, God imprisons the souls of non-Christians in hell where they serve a punishment sentence for their sin and unbelief.
非基督徒死后他们的灵魂被上帝囚禁在地狱里，作为他们罪与不信的惩罚。

Matthew 8:12 – “The subjects of that kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Also see Matthew 22:13; 24:51; 25:30.)
《马太福音》8:12 – 惟有本国的子民，竟被赶到外面黑暗里去，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。”
Luke 16:22-31 – 22) The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to
Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23) In hell, where he was in
torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24) So he called to him, “Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire”. 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26) And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.” 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment. 29) Abraham replied, “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.” 30) “No, Father Abraham,” he said, “but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.” 31) He said to him, “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.”
《路加福音》16：22－31——22后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。23他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远的望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，24就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。’25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。26不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。’27财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。’29亚伯拉罕说：‘他们有摩西和先知的话可以听从。’30他说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的，若有一个从死里复活的，到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。’31亚伯拉罕说：‘若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。”
2. After their bodies die, people who reject what Jesus did for them go to hell. Here is non-stop agony for eternity. There is extreme pain without even the blessing of light, plus eternal regret for their sins and anger at the God who does not accept paltry human attempts to reform.
拒绝接受耶稣为他们所成就的人死后去地狱。在地狱当中，这里有不停止的永恒的煎熬。他们经历着极大的痛苦，甚至没有神所赐福的光，加上他们为自己的罪恶而感到的永久的后悔和对不接受人要自我改造的一丝努力的上帝的愤怒。
C. What is heaven like?
天堂什么样？
2 Corinthians 12:4 – I was caught up to paradise. (See also Luke 23:43 and Revelation 2:7.)
《哥林多后书》12:4 – 我被提到乐园里。（同时参看《路加福音》23:43和《启示录》2:7）
Revelation 14:13 – Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”
《启示录》14：13——我听见从天上有声音说：“你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了！”圣灵说：“是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，作工的果效也随着他们。”
1) After their bodies die, people who depend on Jesus are in heaven. There they enjoy all the blessings God has to offer. Their souls enjoy a welcome rest and relief from the burdens, struggles and pains of their earthly lives.
信靠耶稣的人肉体死后进入天堂，在那里他们享受上帝所有的一切祝福。这些灵魂脱离了世上的重担，争战与痛苦，体验了欢迎与享受安息。
Luke 23:42-43 – Then he (the believing robber) said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into
Your kingdom.” 43) Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with Me
in paradise.”
《路加福音》23：42－43——42他（有信心的强盗）就说：“耶稣啊，你得国降临的时候，求你记念我！”43耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你：今日你要同我在乐园里了。”
Revelation 21:3-5 – I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Now the dwelling of God is
with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be
with them and be their God. 4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” 5 He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!”
《启示录》21：3-5 – 3我听见有大声音从宝座出来说：“看哪， 神的帐幕在人间。他要与人同住，他们要作他的子民； 神要亲自与他们同住，作他们的 神。4 神要擦去他们一切的眼泪，不再有死亡，也不再有悲哀、哭号、疼痛，因为以前的事都过去了。”
5坐宝座的说：“看哪，我将一切都更新了。”又说：“你要写上，因这些话是可信的，是真实的。”
Revelation 22:3-5 – 3 No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will
be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 4 They will see his face, and his name will
be on their foreheads. 5 There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
《启示录》22：3-5 – 3 以后再没有咒诅。在城里有 神和羔羊的宝座，他的仆人都要伺奉他，4也要见他的面。他的名字必写在他们的额上。5不再有黑夜。他们也不用灯光、日光，因为主 神要光照他们，他们要作王，直到永永远远。
2) After people’s bodies die, people who depend on Jesus instantly enjoy the incredible home God’s prepared. No one ever gets bored there. It is a wonderful place like the garden of Eden. Nothing can ever spoil it.
信靠耶稣的人肉体死后立刻享受到上帝预备的绝好的家，在那里没人会厌倦。那是一个极好的地方，就像伊甸园，没有什么能够破坏它。
Philippians 1:21-23 – 21) For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 22) If I am to go on living
in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!
23) I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is better by
far.
《腓立比书》1：21－23——21因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处。22但我在肉身活着，若成就我工夫的果子，我就不知道该挑选什么。23我正在两难之间，情愿离世与基督同在，因为这是好得无比的。
3) After people’s bodies die, people who depend on Jesus live forever with Jesus in heaven. Having Jesus as your personal friend and companion for all time deletes any sensation of loneliness.
信靠耶稣的人肉体死后，会在天堂与基督永远同在。有基督作为我们个人的朋友和永远的同伴会消除任何孤独的感觉。
Luke 16:22a, 25 – 22) The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
《路加福音》16：22a，25—22a后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。
4) After people’s bodies die, people who depend on Jesus go to “the place of honor next to Abraham.” One of the ways God pictures heaven is as the best wedding reception. Abraham hosts it. You are the guest of honor. We’ll know everyone there intimately without introduction. They’ll know us the same way.
信靠耶稣的人肉体死后去 “亚伯拉罕身旁的荣耀之地”。上帝所描绘的天堂的一个图景是最佳的婚礼接待处，我们是贵宾。我们不需要介绍就会熟悉地知道那里的所有人。亚伯拉罕主持婚礼接待。他们同样会很了解我们。
Isaiah 57:1-2 – 1) The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. 2) Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
《以赛亚书》57：1－2-- 1义人死亡，无人放在心上；虔诚人被收去，无人思念。这义人被收去是免了将来的祸患。2他们得享（原文作“进入”）平安。素行正直的，各人在坟里（原文作“床上”）安歇。
5) After people’s bodies die, God frees them from the effects of evil. They enjoy a new life without evil urges or instincts. Also, there’s no more suffering the consequences for other people’s sins.
信靠耶稣的人肉体死后，上帝将他们从罪恶的捆绑中释放。他们得享一种没有罪恶冲动和本能的新生活，而且再也不用因别人的罪而承受后果。
D. After people die, are they aware of people still alive on earth?
人死后，是否还能意识到活在地上的人们？
Luke 16:27-28 – 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
《路加福音》16：27－28——27财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。
1) The rich man remembered his five brothers living with their father and not depending on Jesus. (It seems like after death we remember some of our life on earth.)
这个财主记得他父亲的家里有五个兄弟，他们还没有认识真正的神。（这似乎说明我们死后对过去在世间的事情是有认知的。）

Isaiah 63:16 – But You are our Father though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is Your name.
《以赛亚书》63：16——亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父，从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。
2) Abraham died 1250 years before Isaiah. Israel (Jacob) lived 1050 years before Isaiah. Both men did not know and could not acknowledge Isaiah or the people living at Isaiah’s time. (It seems like after death we aren’t aware of current events on earth.)
早于以赛亚1250年的亚伯拉罕和早于以赛亚1050年的以色列（雅各）不知道也没有任何关于以赛亚或生在以赛亚时代的人的认知。（这似乎表明，我们死后对世间的情况是没有认知的。）
Revelation 6:9-11 – 9) When He (Jesus, the Lamb of God) opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10) They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until You judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11) Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.
《启示录》6：9－11 -- 9揭开第五印的时候，我看见在祭坛底下，有为　神的道、并为作见证被杀之人的灵魂，10大声喊着说：“圣洁真实的主啊，你不审判住在地上的人，给我们伸流血的冤，要等到几时呢？”11于是有白衣赐给他们各人，又有话对他们说：“还要安息片时，等着一同作仆人的和他们的弟兄也像他们被杀，满足了数目。
3) In heaven we remember what happened to us on earth and that Judgment Day hasn’t come. (It seems like after death we’re aware that life here goes on.)
在天上我们对过去在地上发生在我们身上的事情是有认知的，也知道审判之日还没有来临。（这似乎表明死后，我们知道这里的生活在继续。）

E. The Possibility Of Reincarnation, Soul Migration, Or A Second Chance At Salvation
投胎的可能，灵魂的迁徙或者再次救恩的机会
Hebrews 9:27-28 – 27) Just as a person is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28) so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.”
《希伯来书》9：27－28 -- 27按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。28像这样，基督既然一次被献，担当了多人的罪，将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现，并与罪无关，乃是为拯救他们。
• A person gets the chance of a lifetime here. When it’s over, that person’s soul faces God’s decision about where that person will spend eternity.
一个人的生命只有一次。肉体的生命结束后，一个人的灵魂来到上帝的面前接受上帝命定永恒的归宿。

F. Communicating With The Dead
与死人的交流
Luke 16:27-28 - 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
《路加福音》16：27－28 -- 27财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。
1) The rich man in hell realized that he couldn’t personally communicate with his family members on earth.
在地狱里的这个财主意识到自己不能亲自与在世间仍然活着的家人交流。
Isaiah 63:16 – But You are our Father though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is Your name.
《以赛亚书》63：16-- 亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父，从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。
2) Abraham and Israel had died and did not communicate with or respond to people on earth.
亚伯拉罕与以色列已经死亡，没有与现今仍然活着的人交流与回应。
Matthew 17:3 – Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
《马太福音》17：3 -- 忽然，有摩西、以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣说话。
3) In a special miracle, God sent Moses and Elijah (both who had died and/or went to heaven centuries before) to visit Jesus and speak with Him.
在一个特殊的神迹中，上帝打发摩西、以利亚（他们都是已经死去、并且/或者说多个世纪前就去天堂了）来探访耶稣，并与耶稣说话。
4) 1 Samuel 28:11-19 Samuel’s “return” from the dead to communicate with King Saul. (Some scholars think that the “Samuel” who appeared to the witch of Endor and Saul was an evil angel impersonating the real Samuel.)
《撒母耳记上》28：11-19撒母耳从死里回到扫罗的面前与他对话。（注解：有些圣经学者认为那个出现在隐多珥的女巫和扫罗面前的“撒母耳”是魔鬼装扮的，一个邪恶的天使装扮了撒母耳的形象）
 The Bible principle is that people here and people in that other world do not and cannot communicate with each other. God can make exceptions and allow this to happen if He wants.
圣经的原则是地上的人和那个世界的人没有也不能互相交流。上帝可以有例外，如果愿意的话，会让这一切发生。
 What do you think of cases like Matthew 27:51-53, Jairus’ daughter, the widow from Nain’s son, Lazarus, etc.?
你如何看马太福音27:51-53，睚鲁的女儿，拿因寡妇的儿子，拉撒路等？
