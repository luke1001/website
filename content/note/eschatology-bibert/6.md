第七课(lesson 7) 永罚/地狱
7. Eternal Damnation/Hell
7．永罚/地狱
Hebrews 10:26-27, 31 – If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. . . . It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
希伯来书10:26-27,31-- 26 因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了；27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火……31落在永生　神的手里，真是可怕的！
Luke 16:22-23 – The rich man also died and was buried. 23) In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
路加福音16:22-23 -- 22后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。23他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里……

A. The Bible speaks very clearly and powerfully about the constant torture God uses to punish people for their sins and rejection of Jesus’ gift.
在圣经中，神明确而有力的说到，对神的礼物的拒绝和犯罪的人上帝将用恒久的折磨作为惩罚。

Luke 16:24-28 - 24) So he (the rich man) called to him, “Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.” 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26) And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.” 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
路加福音16:24-28-- 24就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪！可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。’25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。26不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。’27财主说：‘我祖啊！既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去；28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。’
1. God describes hell as constant torture. The pain there is worse than severe burns. There is never one positive thing there. The Greek word here is “Hades.” Hades is where people who’ve been resistant to Jesus’ amnesty go to suffer God’s punishment.)
上帝描述地狱是恒久的折磨，那里的痛苦比烈火更甚，那里没有一点好的东西。这里《路加福音》16章）的希腊词是“Hades”，是拒绝上帝赦免的人们去受上帝惩罚的地方。）

Matthew 5:22 – But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brothers will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca’ is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, “You fool!” will be in danger of the fire of hell.
马太福音5:22-- 只是我告诉你们：凡向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判(有古卷在“凡”字下添“无缘无故地”五字)；凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断；凡骂弟兄是魔利的，难免地狱的火。
2. God describes hell as scorching, intense punishment. The Greek word here is “Gehenna.” The Hinnom Valley near Jerusalem is where they burned the garbage and the dead animal bodies. The word “Gehenna” conjures disgusting images of death, fire, smoke and an unbearable smell.
上帝描述地狱是炙热的严罚之地。这里（《马太福音》5章）的单词“地狱”是由希腊语“Gehenna”翻译而来，这个词是从耶路撒冷附近的一个山谷欣嫩子谷的名字而来，那里是垃圾和动物的死尸被带去焚烧之地。单词“Gehenna”让人想起死亡、火焰、烟以及难闻的气味这些不好的图景。
3. The Holy Spirit uses other terms to describe hell:
圣灵用其他字眼描述地狱
Matthew 13:41-42 – 41) The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42) They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
马太福音 13:41-42-- 41人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，42 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。
a. Jesus pictures hell as an inescapable roaring furnace. Its extreme pain and resentment is unbearable and beyond our grasp.
耶稣描述地狱为一个轰鸣的火炉，人们的极度痛苦和憎恨是我们不能想象的。
Matthew 25:41 – “Then He (Jesus) will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,’ you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared from the devil and His angels.”
马太福音 25:41-- 王又要向那左边的说：‘你们这被咒诅的人，离开我！进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！
b. Jesus pictures hell as the fire burning forever (originally the penal colony God made for evil angels). This is God’s curse or damnation on sin and stubborn refusal to depend on God’s charity.
耶稣描述地狱是永火之处（永火最初为惩罚罪恶的天使而创造），这是上帝对罪和顽固拒绝上帝的爱的咒诅。
Matthew 25:46a – “Then they will go away to eternal punishment.”
马太福音25:46a --“这些人要往永刑里去；”
c. Hell is where there is no break ever for eternity.
地狱是永远不能逃脱的地方。

Philippians 3:19a – “Their destiny is destruction.”
腓立比书3:19a --“ 这些人要往永刑里去；”
d. The Bible calls hell destruction. It doesn’t mean God annihilates you. There is no mercy in hell. That would be a blessing.
《圣经》称地狱是毁灭之地，这并不意味着上帝消亡你，地狱里没有仁慈，消亡反而是赐福。

2 Thessalonians 1:9 – They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power.
提摩太后书1:9 神救了我们，以圣召召我们，不是按我们的行为，乃是按他的旨意和恩典。这恩典是万古之先，在基督耶稣里赐给我们的；
e. What makes hell no way to live is the absence of all God’s blessings.
使人无法在地狱生活的是没有任何上帝的祝福。

2 Peter 2:17 – These men are like springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
彼得后书2:17 -- 这些人是无水的井，是狂风催逼的雾气，有墨黑的幽暗为他们存留。
f. Light is a blessing. Hell is without this blessing. Jesus experienced this deep, dense darkness on the cross. His last hours were without any of God’s blessings – the very definition of hell.
光是一种祝福，地狱里没有这种祝福。耶稣在十架上经历了这种又深又浓的黑暗，他最后的时辰没有上帝的任何祝福 – 这正是地狱的定义。
Revelation 20:14 – Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
启示录20:14 --死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里；这火湖就是第二次的死。
g. Hell is the lake of fire and the second death.
地狱是火湖，是第二次的死。
Luke 8:31 – And [the evil angels] begged [Jesus] repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. (Also see Revelation 9:1-2,11; 11:7-8; 20:1,3.)
路加福音8:31 – 鬼就央求耶稣，不要嘱咐他们到无底坑去。（同时参考启示录9:1-2,11; 11:7-8; 20:1,3）
h. The Holy Spirit pictures hell as a dark, bottomless pit full of pain.
圣灵描述地狱是一个充满痛苦的黑暗的无底坑。
Jude 6 – And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
犹大书 6—又有不守本位、离开自己住处的天使，主用锁链把他们永远拘留在黑暗里，等候大日的审判。
2 Peter 2:4 – For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment.
彼得后书 2:4 – 就是天使犯了罪， 神也没有宽容，曾把他们丢在地狱，交在黑暗坑中，等候审判。
i. The chains in hell mean no parole, no sabbaticals, no time off for good behavior.
地狱的锁链意味着没有假释，没有安息年，没有因为好行为可以终止。
Psalm 11:5-6 – 5) The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence His soul hates. 6) On the wicked He will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.
诗篇 11:5-6-- 5耶和华试验义人；惟有恶人和喜爱强暴的人，他心里恨恶。6他要向恶人密布网罗，有烈火、硫磺、热风，作他们杯中的分。
Psalm 38:4, 8 – My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. I am feeble and utterly crushed: I groan in anguish of heart.
诗篇 38:4,8-- 4我的罪孽高过我的头，如同重担叫我担当不起。8我被压伤，身体疲倦；因心里不安，我就唉哼。
Revelation 20:10 – And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
启示录 20:10 – 那迷惑他们的魔鬼被扔在硫磺的火湖里，就是兽和假先知所在的地方，他们必昼夜受痛苦，直到永永远远。
B. The worst part of hell is having no hope and no rest for your conscience.
地狱最糟糕的在于没有希望并且你的良心没有安息。
Luke 12:47-48 – 47) That servant who knows his master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. 48) From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
路加福音12:47-48 -- 47仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备，又不顺他的意思行，那仆人必多受责打；48 惟有那不知道的，作了当受责打的事，必少受责打；因为多给谁，就向谁多取；多托谁，就向谁多要。
Matthew 11:20-24 – 20) Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 21) “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22) But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 23) And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you have been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 24) But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”
马太福音 11:20-24-- 20耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能，那些城的人终不悔改，就在那时候责备他们说： 21 “哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。22但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，推罗、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！23迦百农啊，你已经升到天上(或作“你将要升到天上吗？”)，将来必坠落阴间，因为在你那里所行的异能，若行在所多玛，它还可以存到今日。24但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比你还容易受呢！”
C. Jesus teaches that there are levels of suffering in hell. Hell is unbearable for everyone. It will be worse for some people. Those who knew better because they heard about Jesus will have it worse when they reject the Gospel.
耶稣教导说在地狱中人们所经历的痛苦会有层度上的不同。地狱里对任何人都是无法忍受的，但对一些人更糟糕。对于那些知道多一些神的旨意，因为他们听到过关于耶稣的人，若是他们拒绝福音情形会更糟糕。

D. Some Bible-based descriptions and observations about hell.
一些基于圣经的关于地狱的描述和揭示。
1. “This is the terrible judgment that is bound to come upon the unbelieving: their hands and feet shall be tied, and they shall be cast into outermost darkness, that is, they must eternally lie captive with the devil in hell-fire. They must lie in darkness, cut off from God’s light, that is, from all comfort, in eternal torment, anguish, and sadness, so that they will nevermore see one spark of light. This is terrible misery, if only we would let it touch our heart: to lie captive in this way in hell and torment forever, with nothing but wailing and gnashing of teeth. By these things the Lord indicates all imaginable torments. Christ says in effect: You will suffer more than words can tell and thoughts can grasp.” – Martin Luther, commending on Matthew 22:13
这是对于不信的可怕的审判：他们的手脚被绑，被扔在遥远的黑暗中，那里，他们只能永远在地狱之火中与魔鬼同为俘虏。他们的手脚被绑，就不能藉做工使他们重获自由。除此以外，他们躺在黑暗中，与神的光隔离，与安慰隔绝，在永远的痛苦、苦闷和悲哀中，以致永远看不见一点亮光。这是可怕的痛苦，如果我们仅仅用心想一下：在地狱里做这样的俘虏并永远受折磨，除了哭泣和切齿以外什么都没有。用这些事主表明了所有能想象得到的痛苦。事实上基督在说：你们将要承受比言语能说比思维能领会的更多的痛苦。——马丁路德，对于马太福音22:13的注解。
2. Hell is both the concentrated, continuous loss of blessings and the concentrated, continuous experience of torture.
地狱既是集中持续地失去祝福，也是集中持续地体验折磨。
3. “Hell is so horrible. We should not think or speak of hell without tears in our eyes.” - John Stott
“地狱太可怕了。我们想到谈到关于地狱的事的时候眼中应该有眼泪。”John Stott
4. “I wish that I could take you to hell for two weeks so we could personally experience how terrible it is. Then, when we return to this world, I pray that we would speak and live so that we make sure that no one would ever go there.” - William Booth
“我希望我能带你到地狱逛两周，我们就能亲身感受到地狱是多可怕了。然后，当我们回到这个世界的时候，我祈祷我们每个人传讲生活出神样子，确保没有一人要到那里。”William Booth
Matthew 23:33 – You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
马太福音23:33-- 你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种啊！怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？
E. Jesus raises a question every sinner must face: “How can I avoid hell?”
耶稣对所有罪人提出了一个必须要面对的问题：“一个人怎能逃避地狱的审判呢？”
Matthew 7:13 – Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
马太福音 7:13 – “你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡，那门是宽的，路是大的，进去的人也多。

路加福音12:4-5-- 4 “我的朋友，我对你们说，那杀身体以后不能再作什么的，不要怕他们。5我要指示你们当怕的是谁；当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们，正要怕他。
Ezekiel 18:23, 32 – Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? . . . 32) For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!
以西结书18:23,32-- 23主耶和华说：恶人死亡，岂是我喜悦的吗？不是喜悦他回头离开所行的道存活吗？ 32主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。”

G. God pleads with us to rethink our attitudes and behavior and depend on His pardon that Jesus engineered to rescue us from hell.
上帝请求我们重新思考我们的态度和行为，信靠耶稣发起的把我们从地狱中拯救出来的上帝的饶恕。
