Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7) Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8) All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9) Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of Me. 10) At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11) and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12) Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13) but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14) And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

《马太福音》24：21-25—— 21因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。22若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了。23那时，若有人对你们说‘基督在这里’，或说‘基督在那里’，你们不要信。24因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事。倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。25看哪，我预先告诉你们了。

《启示录》6：15－17—— 15地上的君王、臣宰、将军、富户、壮士和一切为奴的、自主的，都藏在山洞和岩石穴里，16向山和岩石说：“倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目和羔羊的忿怒，17因为他们忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？”
9) People laugh off God’s warnings. For those without Jesus, the end will bring panic and pandemonium. They will begin the cover-up. It won’t do any good.
