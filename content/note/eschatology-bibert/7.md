8．永生/天堂
Deuteronomy 26:15a – Look down from heaven, Your holy dwelling place.
申命记26:15a -- 求你从天上你的圣所垂看，
John 3:16 – For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
约翰福音3:16 --　神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。
A. In His Word, God speaks very clearly and specifically about a place different from this life, the home of people who depend on the gift Jesus earned us with His life and death.
在圣经中，上帝非常清楚明确地谈到一个不同于今生的地方，是信靠耶稣用他的生和死为我们赢得的礼物的人们的家园。

John 14:2-3 – In my Father’s house are many rooms (dwelling places); if it were not so I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
约翰福音14:2-3-- 2 在我父的家里有许多住处；若是没有，我就早已告诉你们了。我去原是为你们预备地方去。3 我若去为你们预备了地方，就必再来接你们到我那里去；我在哪里，叫你们也在哪里。
1. Jesus pictures heaven as the Father’s house, where all believers will live.
耶稣把天堂描绘成天父的家，信徒将在那里居住。
Revelation 2:7 – He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
启示录2:7-- 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，我必将　神乐园中生命树的果子赐给他吃。’
2. Jesus pictures heaven as paradise, the beautiful preserve where everything has reverted to its original state of perfection and nothing can ruin it.
耶稣把天堂描绘成乐园，是美丽的林地，那里一切物种恢复到以前完善的状态，没有什么可以破坏它。
2 Timothy 4:18, 8 – The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. . . . Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day – and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.
提摩太后书4:18, 8-- 18主必救我脱离诸般的凶恶，也必救我进他的天国。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿们。…… 8从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。
3. Before Judgment Day, heaven is not here. God’s heavenly kingdom is in another dimension which Jesus also called paradise (Matthew 23:43).
审判日之前，天堂不在这里。神的王国在另外一个耶稣称为乐园的纬度里。
2 Corinthians 5:8 – We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
哥林多后书 5:8 -- 我们坦然无惧，是更愿意离开身体与主同住。
4. The Holy Spirit also pictures heaven as being at home with the Lord. This existence is the ideal that God had originally designed for people.
圣灵也把天堂描绘成与主同住的地方，这样的存在是上帝起初为人设计的理想状态。
Revelation 21:10-11, 16a, 18, 21-24, 27 – 10) And the angel carried me away in the spirit, to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 11) It shone like the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. . . . 16a) The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. . . . 18) The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. . . . 21) The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass. 22) I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23) The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 24) The nations will walk be its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. . . . 27) Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
启示录21:10-11， 16a， 18,21-24,27 10我被圣灵感动，天使就带我到一座高大的山，将那由　神那里，从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷指示我，11城中有　神的荣耀；城的光辉如同极贵的宝石，好象碧玉，明如水晶。16a城是四方的，长宽一样。……18 墙是碧玉造的，城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃。21十二个门是十二颗珍珠；每门是一颗珍珠。城内的街道是精金，好象明透的玻璃。22我未见城内有殿，因主　神，全能者和羔羊为城的殿。23那城内又不用日月光照，因有　神的荣耀光照，又有羔羊为城的灯。24列国要在城的光里行走；地上的君王必将自己的荣耀归与那城。27凡不洁净的，并那行可憎与虚谎之事的，总不得进那城；只有名字写在羔羊生命册上的才得进去。

5. The language of Revelation pictures heaven as a city made out of priceless minerals with an impregnable wall. Since shelter is not necessary in a world without sin’s consequences, this pictures a safe life that we could never buy.
启示录的语言把天堂描绘成由无价矿物组成的具有不可攻破的城墙的城，既然在一个没有罪的后果的世界里避难处是不必要的，这就描绘了一种我们永远不能买到的安全的生活。
1 Peter 1:3-4 – Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4) and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade – kept in heaven for you.
彼得前书1:3-4-- 3愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神！他曾照自己的大怜悯，藉耶稣基督从死里复活，重生了我们，叫我们有活泼的盼望，4可以得着不能朽坏，不能玷污，不能衰残，为你们存留在天上的基业。

They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. . . 13) Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes – who are they, and where did the come from? 14) I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “There are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
启示录7:9,13-14-- 9此后，我观看，见有许多的人，没有人能数过来，是从各国、各族、各民、各方来的，站在宝座和羔羊面前，身穿白衣，手拿棕树枝，13长老中有一位问我说：“这些穿白衣的是谁？是从哪里来的？”14我对他说：“我主，你知道。”他向我说：“这些人是从大患难中出来的，曾用羔羊的血，把衣裳洗白净了，
3. The ticket to heaven is the spandex Jesus-costume God gave us at baptism. Jesus bought it for us with His flawless, lifetime achievements in our place.
通向天堂的票是我们在受洗时上帝给我们的耶稣穿着的特殊料子的衣服，耶稣用他无暇的终生的成就替我们买了这件衣服。
Colossians 3:4 – When Christ, who is your life, appears then you also will appear with Him in glory.

Revelation 22:3b-5 – 3) The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will serve Him. 4) They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. 5) There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
启示录22:3b-5-- 3……在城里有　神和羔羊的宝座；他的仆人都要事奉他，4也要见他的面。他的名字必写在他们的额上。5不再有黑夜。他们也不用灯光、日光，因为主　神要光照他们；他们要作王，直到永永远远。

But those who are considered worthy of taking part I that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.”
路加福音20:34-36--34耶稣说：“这世界的人有娶有嫁；35惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁；36因为他们不能再死，和天使一样；既是复活的人，就为　神的儿子。

When the Lord saw her, His heart went out to her and He said, “Don’t cry.” Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
路加福音 7:11-15过了不多时(有古卷作“次日”)，耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来；这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇；有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。主看见那寡妇就怜悯她，对她说：“不要哭。”于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说：“少年人，我吩咐你，起来！”那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。

天堂中荣耀的级别

2 Corinthians 9:6 – Remember this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
哥林多后书 9:6 -- 少种的少收，多种的多收，”这话是真的。
1 Corinthians 15:41-42 – 41) The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; the star differs from star in splendor. 42) So it will be with the resurrection of the dead.
哥林多前书15:41-42-- 41日有日的荣光，月有月的荣光，星有星的荣光；这星和那星的荣光，也有分别。42死人复活也是这样：所种的是必朽坏的，复活的是不朽坏的；

马太福音19:28--耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们这跟从我的人，到复兴的时候，人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。

2. God does seem to indicate that there may be degrees of glory in heaven, based on the people God used us to bring to Jesus or the suffering we faced for uncompromising Christian principles on earth.
上帝确实好像说天堂里的荣耀有级别，根据上帝使用我们带到主耶稣面前的人的多少或我们因在地上不妥协坚持基督徒原则而受的苦的多少。
a) Martin Luther said: “It is true, there will be a difference in the next life, according as people have labored and lived here. One believer will have greater brightness than the other because he worked or suffered more in his position. Everyone will have his distinction and glory according to His position. Still one God and Lord will be in all, and each will have the one and the same joy and bliss. In his person none shall be more or have works, through which he will shine and praise God so that people will say: St. Peter has done more than I or another. This man or this woman has led such a fine life and done such great things. In short, all are to be alike before God in faith and grace and celestial bliss, but they are to differ in their works and their honor.”
马丁路德说过：“确实，在下一次生命中会有不同，有如这里劳动生活的人们。一个信徒在他的职分上因为做的工多或受的苦多而更加闪光。每个人因他的职位不同其荣耀会有所不同。然而独一的真神将在所有人的心里，每个人都将拥有同样的喜乐和祝福。神的子民中无人或有行为可藉以更闪光和更加赞美神，以致人们说，圣彼得比我或别人作的更多。这个弟兄或这个姐妹过了这么好的人生，成就了如此大的事情。简言之，所有人在神面前的信心、恩典和属天的祝福上都是相似的，只是他们的职位和荣耀有所不同。”
b) There is no envy or jealousy in heaven. Like the good angels, we’ll celebrate the ways people served God here and the enjoyment God gives each believer there.
在天堂里没有嫉妒和猜疑。如同圣洁的天使，我们将庆祝地上的人们曾经服侍上帝的方式和上帝给予那里的每位信徒的喜乐。

Psalm 73:23-26 – 23) Yet I am always with You; You hold me by my right hand. 24) You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me into glory. 25) Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides You. 26) My heart and my flesh may fail, but God is the Strength of my heart and my Portion forever.
诗篇73:23-26-- 23然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。24你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。25除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。26我的肉体和我的心肠衰残；但　神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。
Philippians 3:14, 20 – 14) I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. . . . 20) But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.
腓立比书3:14,20-- 14向着标竿直跑，要得　神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。 20我们却是天上的国民，并且等候救主，就是主耶稣基督，从天上降临。
2 Timothy 6b-8 – 6) The time has come for my departure. 7) I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8) Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day – and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.
提摩太后书 6b-8-- 6我离世的时候到了。7那美好的仗我已经打过了，当跑的路我已经跑尽了，所信的道我已经守住了。 8从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。
