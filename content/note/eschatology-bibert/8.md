第九课(lesson 9) 关于末后的一个重大错误
9. A Major Error Of The End Times
9.关于末后的一个重大错误
Matthew 24:3-4, 11 – 3) As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “When will this happened, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4) Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. . . . 11) and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.”
马太福音24章 3.耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗的来说，请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事。你降临和世界的末了，有什么预兆呢。4.耶稣回答说，你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们…11. 且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。
2 Peter 2:1-3a – 1) But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them – bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2) Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3) In their greed, these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up.
彼得后书2章 1．从前在百姓中有假先知起来，将来在你们中间，也必有假师傅，私自引进害人的异端，连买他们的主他们也不承认，自取速速的灭亡。 2．将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为，便叫真道，因他们的缘故被毁谤。 3.他们因有贪心，要用捏造的言语，在你们身上取利。
A. Jesus tells us in the Bible that misleading teachers will trick people into believing lies about the end of this world.
耶稣在圣经里告诉我们假先知会迷惑人去相信关于末世的谎言。
B. One of the most misleading teachings about the end of life here comes from churches. We call it Millennialism.
其中一个关于末世的最错误的观点出自教会，我们称这个观点为千禧年。
1. Millennialism is the wrong belief that Jesus will return before Judgment Day to bring a 1,000 year period of prosperity and peace to this life.
千禧年是一种错误的信念，认为在主在末日之前会给这个世界带来1000年的太平盛世。
2. The word “millennium” comes from two Latin words: “mille” which means “1,000” and “annus” which means “year.” Millennialism is also called “Chiliasm.” The word “chiliasm” is the Greek way of saying “1,000.”
千禧年“millennium”来自于两个拉丁字母的组合：“mille” 和“annus”，前者意为一千，后者为年。千禧年也被称为“锡利亚说”(Chiliasm)，“Chiliasm”来自希腊词“chilia”意为一千。
3. The idea behind millennialism is tempting. It pictures an end to life’s problems and a new “paradise” on earth. Millennialists believe in heaven on earth.
千禧年背后的观点是有诱惑力的。它描绘了地上问题的结束和地上的新“乐园”，持千禧年论点的人相信地上的天堂。
4. Millennialistic thinking has always been attractive. Jewish people bought into it before and during Jesus’ time. Patriotic Jewish freedom fighters from Galilee dreamt of national independence and a worldwide empire. Jesus’ own students showed this philosophy when they asked before His ascension, “Lord, are You at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6).
千禧年思想一直都有吸引力。犹太人在耶稣时代以前和耶稣时代就相信这个观点，来自加利利的爱国的犹太自由战士梦想着国家的独立和一个世界范围的王国，耶稣的门徒也曾显示出这种哲学，在耶稣升天后他们曾问道：“主阿，你复兴以色列国，就在这时候吗？” （《使徒行传》1:6）
5. Millennialism claims Bible support. They are explaining the Bible incorrectly. Millenialists love Revelation 20:1-7. It has six references to “a thousand years.” Revelation uses 1,000 (10 x 10 x 10). Multiple 10s picture completeness. This is picture language for the full amount of time between Jesus’ first appearance and His final return. Millennialists disregard God’s picture language with numbers in Revelation. They insist 1,000 years is literally 1,000 years. They also insist that dead believers rule as souls on earth. Neither Revelation 20 nor any other Bible passage says that.
千禧年思想声称有着圣经的支撑。千禧年主义者是在错误地解释圣经，他们喜欢启示录20章1-7节，其中六次提到“一千年”。启示录使用一千这个数字（10*10*10）,几个10连乘代表完全，这是代表基督的初次降临到二次降临之间的时间的象征语言。那些支持千禧年主义的人不顾神在启示录中象征性的数字用法，坚持1000年就是字面的一千年。除此之外，千禧年主义者还坚信已去世的信徒的灵魂会在地上掌权统治，尽管启示录20章和其它圣经章节并没有这么说。
6. There are different forms of Millennialism. Millennialists don’t agree with each other. They often contradict their own teachings.
千禧年主义有不同的形式。千禧年主义者之间有争议，他们自己的教导常常互相矛盾。
a) Most millennialists are premillennialists. They believe there will be a seven-year period, the Great Tribulation. Then Jesus will come back to initiate the thousand years of good times for Christians. They believe all Jews will become Christians during this time. They believe Jesus will defeat the anti-Christ and keep Satan from influencing us. Cyrus Scofield, (1842-1921) was a lawyer who became a pastor with no theological training. He’s the reason millennialism is so popular. His Scofield Reference Bible promoted the dispensational views of theologian John Darby (1800-1882).
大部分千禧年主义者相信前千禧年主义也就是经过一个七年的苦难期后，基督会再来世上为基督徒开启一个前年的好时光。他们相信届时所有犹太人会会成为基督徒，耶稣将会战胜敌基督者，并使撒旦不能再影响我们。Cyrus Sofield，出身律师后成为牧师，从没受过任何神学培训，是千禧年主义流行的原因。他在他的司可福串注圣经中推介神学家John Darby 的豁免观。
b) Some millennialists are postmillennialists. They believe there’ll be a 1,000 years when evil will gradually recede, and social, political, and economic conditions on earth will gradually improve. Then comes the Great Tribulation. Jesus will come after that. He will judge every person and set up the new universe He promised.
一些千禧年主义者相信后千禧年主义。他们相信会有一个一千年的时间期间罪恶会逐渐减少，社会、政治和经济状况会逐渐改善，然后会是苦难期。在这之后基督会再来，审判每个人并建立他应允的新的宇宙。
c) Millennialists also don’t agree about the kind of improvements or the extent of the improvements to look for on earth. Millennialism’s most materialistic view forecasts incredible wealth for believers. A less materialistic view anticipates an improved spiritual outlook before the end. The least deviant millennialism just expects better times before the end.
千禧年主义者对于期望地球上将会出现什么样的改善以及改善的程度互相之间也有争议。最物质主义的千禧年主义者预言信徒会有极大的物质丰富。不太物质主义的千禧年主义期望在末日前会有灵性见识的长进，最不偏侠的千禧年主义仅仅预期末日前会有更好的世代。
7. Millennialism has a home in many Fundamentalist and Evangelical churches, plus Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Holiness ones. Millennialism is also acceptable among non-Christian groups like Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
很多基要派和福音派接受千禧年主义，此外也包括浸信会、卫理公会、长老会、五旬节派和圣教会分会。千禧年主义也被一些诸如摩门教和耶和华见证人这样的异端所接受。
8. Millennialism teaches differently than the Bible.
千禧年主义与圣经上的教导相违。
a) Premillennialists believe Jesus will come back to make His kingdom in this life. Jesus never claimed that. He told Pontius Pilate: “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is from another place.” (John 18:36)
前千禧年主义者认为耶稣会回来建立一个属世的国度。耶稣从来没有这样的声称，他告诉本丢比拉多：“我的国不属这世界。我的国若属这世界，我的臣仆必要争战，使我不至于被交给犹太人。只是我的国不属这世界。”（约18:36）
b) Postmillennialists believe Christians will get lots of uninterrupted peace and prosperity here. The Bible teaches the opposite. “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22b). “Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Timothy 3:12).
后千禧年主义者认为基督徒许多不受干扰的属地的平安昌盛。 圣经的教导是相反的。“我们进入神的国，必须经历许多艰难。”（徒14:22b） “凡立志在基督耶稣里敬虔度日的，也都要受逼迫。”（提后3:12）
c) Millennialists hold to a literalistic (not literal) view of explaining the Bible. They miss the message in the Bible’s picture language. So they force unnecessary literal explanations. For example, millennialists take prophecies about the Messiah’s arrival literally (such as Isaiah 2:2-4, Isaiah 11:6-9; Zechariah 9:9-10; Joel 3:2; Micah 4:1;-4, etc.). These Bible sections simply describe the internal peace the Holy Spirit brings God’s people now and/or the external peace we look forward to after this life in the next world.
千禧年主义者拘泥于字面意思来解释圣经，不了解圣经中象征性语言所传递的信息，因此他们强行不必要的字面解释。例如，千禧年主义者字面解释相信关于弥赛亚到来的预言（例如在以赛亚书2:2-4， 11:6-9；撒加利亚书9:9-10； 约珥书3:2；弥迦书4:1,4，等等）。这些圣经经文只是描述神的信徒现在拥有的内在的平安和我们所期盼的来世生命的外在平安。

9. Millennialism does serious damage to what the Bible teaches. People get hurt when they buy into these misconceptions.
千禧年主义对圣经的教导有极大的破坏。人们接受这些错误的观点会对他们有害：
a) Millennialism downgrades and even disrespects the news God gives about Jesus as the Bible and Sacraments bring them to us. They say that, depending on the period of history, God has used other ways to reach people. Scofield divided world history into seven dispensations, during which God had different standards for saving people.
千禧年主义者忽视甚至藐视基督耶稣的福音和作为恩典工具之圣礼对我们的作用，他们说，根据历史的时代，上帝用其他途径就近人。Scofield把历史分为7个豁免期，在每一个时期上帝拯救人的标准不同。
b) Millennialism teaches people to misread and misunderstand the Bible and rank human speculation over God-given truth.
千禧年主义教导人去错读和错解圣经，把人的臆测置于高于神所启示的真理。
c) Millennialism confuses people about God’s plans for the future. Millennialism’s focus on Jesus making heaven on earth, or that the Church will transform society, or that all Jews will become Christian diverts people’s attention away from God’s clear teachings about Christian priorities and what life will be like at the end.
千禧年主义使人混淆神将来的计划。千禧年主义注重一些东西，像基督会使地上变为天堂、教会将改变社会以及所有的以色列人将变为基督徒，这样的侧重点使人偏离神在圣经上对基督徒的考虑事情的先后秩序和末世生命的形态的清晰教导。
d) Millennialism leads people to concentrate on an imaginary paradise on earth rather than on the real paradise in heaven.
千禧年主义使人关注一个想象中的地上的天堂而不是真实的天上的天堂。
Colossians 3:1-4 - 1) Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 2) Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3) For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4) When Christ, who is your life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.”
10. We need God’s help to resist and oppose the damage Millennialism does. He will help us focus on the real, wonderful, eternal future in heaven He promised people who depend on Jesus.
我们需要上帝帮助我们抵制和反对千禧年主义的破坏性影响，他会帮助我们关注天堂里真实、精彩永恒的未来，他应允了信靠耶稣的人。
