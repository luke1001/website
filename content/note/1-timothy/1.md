#### B. Translation 翻译

1) Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by (according to) the authoritative command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus, our firm assurance (hope). 2) To Timothy, <my>true child in <the>faith. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus, our Lord <be yours="">.  

1）耶稣基督的使徒保罗，按照神我们的救主和我们的坚固盼望耶稣基督所发的权威命令，2)写信给那因信主而作我真儿子的提摩太。愿恩惠、怜悯、平安从父神和我们主基督耶稣归于你！</be></the></my>

3) I urged you to remain in Ephesus, while I traveled to Macedonia, so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines <any longer="">, 4) nor to dedicate (devote) themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These create (promote) controversies (questions) rather than God’s ministry, which is by faith. 5) The goal of this command <is>love <that comes="">from a pure heart, a clear conscience and a sincere faith. 6) Some have swerved (deviated) from these and turned away into meaningless talk. 7) These <people>want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they confidently assert. 

3）我往马其顿去的时候，曾劝你仍住在以弗所，好嘱咐那几个人不可再传异教，4）也不可专注在那荒谬虚构的神话和无穷的家谱。这等事只能引起争论，并不能做成神的工，因神的工是要靠信心。5）这样的命令是出于爱。这爱是从一颗清洁的心、无亏的良心和无伪的信心生出来的。6）有人偏离这些，反去讲毫无意义的话。7）这些人想要作教导律法的老师，却不知道自己所讲论，所断言的是什么。</people></that></is></any>

8) But we know that the law is good, if a person uses it properly (literally, “lawfully”). 9) We also know this: that the law is not made for the righteous person, but for the lawbreakers (lawless) and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy (wicked) and irreligious (anti-godly), for those who murder fathers and those who murder mothers, for murderers, 10) for adulterers, homosexuals, slave traders (enslavers), liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to the sound (healthy) doctrine, 11) that is according to the glorious gospel (gospel of glory) of the supremely blessed God, with which I have been entrusted. 

8）然而，我们知道，律法原是好的，只要人用得恰当（不夸张，“合法地”）。9）我们也知道：律法不是为义人设立的，而是为违法的人，悖逆的人，为不敬虔和犯罪的人，为邪恶不圣洁和与神为敌的人，为那些谋杀父母和杀人的人，10）为行淫的和同性恋，为贩卖奴隶的人，为说谎话和做假见证的人，以及任何行与纯正真道相反的事之人设立的。11）这是根据至圣之神所交托给我的荣耀福音说的。

12) I have gratitude toward (am thankful to) Christ Jesus, who has given me inner strength, that He considered me faithful (trustworthy), placing (appointing) me into service. 13) Previously I was a blasphemer (one who speaks abusive evil) and a persecutor and a violent man (one who delights in inflicting pain). But I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 14) The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly along with faith and the love that is in Christ Jesus. 15) Faithful is the saying and worthy of complete acceptance, <that>Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of which I am the greatest (worst). 16) But because of this, I was shown mercy so that in me, the greatest (worst) sinner, Christ Jesus might show the fullness of His patient restraint as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. 17) Now to the King – eternal, immortal, invisible – to the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. 

12）我感谢那给我力量的耶稣基督，因他以我有忠心（值得信任），派我服侍他。13）我从前是亵渎神的人（说恶毒毁谤的话），迫害人且性情凶残的人（一个以给别人带来痛苦为乐的人），然而我还蒙了怜悯，因为那是在我无知、不信的时候做的。14）我们主的恩典，连同对基督的信心和爱心一起丰富地倾注在我身上。15）这句话是真实的，是完全可以相信的：基督耶稣降世，为要拯救罪人。在罪人中我是最坏的一个。16）然而我蒙了怜悯，是因基督耶稣要在我这最坏的罪人身上显明他完全的忍耐，给后来信他得永生的人作榜样。17）但愿尊贵、荣耀归与那不能朽坏、不能看见、永世的君王、独一的神，直到永永远远。阿门！</that>

18) Timothy, <my>child, I commit <to you="">this mandate (proclamation) in accord with the prophecies previously made about you, so that by <following>: them you may fight the good war, 19) holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have shoved these aside (rejected these) and have become shipwrecked concerning their faith. 20) Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered (given over) to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme (speak abusive evil). 18）

我儿提摩太啊，我照着从前指着你的预言，将这命令交托给你，叫你能因遵从这些命令而可以打那美好的仗，19）常存信心和无亏的良心；有人丢弃了这些，便像船只遭遇风暴一样损坏了他们的信心。20）其中有许米乃和亚历山大，我已经把他们交给撒旦，使他们受责罚，就不再说恶毒毁谤的话了。</following></to></my>

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 学习并 思考的事项

1.  In verse 1, Paul identifies himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ. He belongs to Jesus Christ and represents Him.Paul also states that he serves by God’s choice and command and with God’s authority. The apostle also indicates that the God he serves is the great Savior from sin and the sure Source of all future blessing.. 

    在第一节中，保罗说自己的身份是耶稣基督的使徒。他属于耶稣基督，并且代表他。保罗还指出，他的侍奉是神的选择和命令，带着神的权柄。这个使徒还表明，他所侍奉的神是将人从罪恶之中救赎出来的伟大救主，又是将来一切祝福的真正源头。

2.  In verse 2, Paul warmly greets his co-worker, Timothy, whom he regards as his true spiritual child in their common faith in Christ. He announces God’s blessing and emphasizes God’s wonderful love for sinful people. He tells us that God gives us His grace (His freely given love for those who deserve only punishment), His mercy (His love for the needy and helpless) and His peace (His restoring of wholeness and harmony to our sin-ruined lives).  
    
    在第二节中，保罗热诚地问候他的同工提摩太。基于对基督的共同信靠，保罗视提摩太为他主里的真儿子。他宣告神的祝福，强调神对罪人的奇妙大爱。他告诉我们，神把他的恩典（他将爱白白赐给那些只配受惩罚的人）、他的怜悯（他把爱赐给那些有需要和无助的人）以及他的平安（他把我们被罪摧毁的生命恢复原状，使它完整、和谐）赐给了我们。

3.  In verses 3-4, Paul reminds Timothy of the task Paul had given him earlier to stay in Ephesus and to stop the false teachers who were troubling the church. These false teachers were not teaching God’s Word faithfully and, instead, were inventing and promoting untrue stories and teachings that created doubts and controversies among the people. 

    在第3-4节中，保罗提醒提摩太，他曾要求他仍住在以弗所，阻止在那里扰乱教会的假教师。那些假教师没有忠实地教导神的话语，反而捏造、传播假故事、假学说，在人群中间制造疑惑和争论。

4.  In verse 5, Paul explains that the purpose of stopping the false teachers was to accomplish God’s goals for people. God wants His Word to be taught correctly so that he can produce a pure heart, a clear conscience and a sincere faith in people. 

    在第5节中，保罗解释说，阻止假教师的目的是为了成就神对人的心意。神要他的话语得到正确的教导，使他能在人心里做工，生出纯洁的心，无亏的良心和无伪的信心。

5.  In verses 6-7, Paul warns that some in Ephesus have rejected the true teaching of God’s Word and goals for people. Instead they engage in empty talk. They confidently claim to be expert teachers of God’s Word, but, in reality, they are only confused, ignorant and foolish opponents of God. 

    在第6-7节中，保罗警告说，以弗所已经有人拒绝神话语的纯正教导，摈弃神对人的心意。他们专注虚假的言论，还妄称自己是神话语的专家，但事实上，他们只是糊涂无知又愚蠢的神的仇敌。

6.  In verses 8-9a, Paul points out one of the major errors of the false teachers. These misguided people were not using the law of God properly. They presented themselves as people who are righteous because they incorrectly thought that have kept the law well enough to satisfy God. They were teaching others to think that they also could gain their righteousness before God by their personal keeping of the law. The false teachers were making the tragic mistake of teaching that sinful people can earn their own salvation by their own imperfect efforts to keep the law. 
    
    在第8-9a节中，保罗指出假教师的一大错误：这些误入歧途的人没有正确使用神的律法。他们把自己定为义人，因为他们误以为自己已经把律法遵守得不错，达到了神的要求。他们的教导使人以为，自己也可以通过遵守律法而在神面前获得称义。假教师教导的可悲错误在于：罪人可以通过自己不完美的努力去遵守律法而获得自己的救恩。

7.  In verses. 9b-11, Paul explains the proper purpose of God’s moral law.He states that the law of God is meant to discourage people from sinning against God and to help sinners recognize the many ways that they rebel against God and violate God’s commands to love Him and to love other people. The law is properly used to expose the sins, crush the pride and convict the consciences of sinners so they will see their wickedness, guilt and hopelessness before a just and holy God and be led to a true sorrow for their sin. 

    在第9b-11节中，保罗解释了神的道德律法的正确用途。他声明：神律法的目的在于阻止人犯罪得罪神，帮助罪人识别人悖逆神、违反神爱人爱神之命令的各个方面。律法是用来显明罪，打击骄傲，说服罪人的良知，使他们在一位公正神圣的上帝面前看见自己的不道德，罪疚以及无望，引导他们为自己的罪真心忏悔。

8.  In verses 12-14, Paul expresses his profound thanks to Jesus Christ for showing mercy on him and allowing him to serve God. Paul had been a strong, destructive, sin-blinded enemy of God. Yet, God showered Paul with His underserved love and brought him to faith in Christ and created a sincere love for God and others in him. 

    在第12-14节中，保罗因为基督向他显明的怜悯，以及神允许他侍奉神，而向耶稣基督真诚感恩。保罗曾是一个被罪蒙蔽、与神为敌的人，极其顽梗，且迫害人。然而，神向保罗显明了他无人配得的爱，使他归信基督，并在他里面生出对神、对人的真诚之爱。

9.  In verse 15, Paul shares an extremely important truth. He declares that Jesus came to the world for the purpose of saving sinners. Then he identifies himself as the greatest or worst of sinners. 

    在第15节中，保罗分享了一个极其重要的真理。他宣告，耶稣基督到世上来的目的是为了拯救罪人。然后，他把自己定为罪人中的罪魁。

10.  In verse 16, Paul proceeds to explain that God showed mercy on him so that he might serve as an example of God’s tremendous patience and as an encouragement and comfort for other sinners to believe in Christ. 

    在第16节中，保罗详细介绍神对他所施的怜悯，使他成为神对人无限容忍的例子，鼓励并安慰其他相信基督的罪人。

11.  In verse 17, Paul adores God as the one true God who is eternal, immortal, invisible and who rules as King and is deserving of endless honor and glory. 

    在第17节中，保罗敬拜神为独一的真神，自有永有，永不朽坏，看不见但却作王掌权，配受无尽的尊崇和荣耀。

12.  In verses 18-19a, Paul charges Timothy to carry out his mission in accord with the commission he had received. By faithfully teaching God’s Word and opposing false teaching, Timothy will fight well in the spiritual war he is in and will retain his faith in Christ. 

    在第18-19a节中，保罗催促提摩太完成已经领受的使命。只要准确教导神的话语，抵挡假教导，提摩太就能打胜这场属灵的战争，留住对基督的信仰。

13.  In verses 19b-20, Paul warns that some have been unfaithful and, as a result, have ruined their faith. Paul mentions Hymenaeus and Alexander as examples among the false teachers in Ephesus. Paul announces that he has declared them to be out of the faith and under the control of Satan so that they might be led to repent of their sin of speaking abusively against God. 

    在第19b-20节中，保罗对一些不忠心的人提出警告，这些不忠已经毁坏了他们的信仰。保罗提到许米乃和亚历山大是以弗所假教师的例子。保罗宣布，他已经宣告他们离弃了信仰，处在撒旦的控制之下。保罗希望他们能因此悔改自己亵渎神的罪。
