#### B. Translation 翻译


1) As many as are slaves under the yoke <of required="" service=""> should consider their own masters to be worthy of full respect so that the name of God and the teaching will not be reviled (spoken against harshly). 2) Those who have believing masters are not to despise (disrespect) them because they are brothers. Rather, <they are=""> to serve them even better because those who are receiving the benefit are believing and dearly loved <people>.. Teach and command (proclaim) these things.


1）凡在特定服务的约定下成为奴仆的人，应该把自己的主人看成是配受十分尊敬的人，免得神的名和教导被亵渎。2）仆人有信道的主人，不可因为他是弟兄就不尊敬他。反而要更好地服侍他，因为接受服侍益处的人是信主蒙爱的人。你要把这些教训都转告他们。


3) If someone teaches false doctrines and does not agree with the sound (healthy) instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the godly teaching, 4) he is conceited (literally, inflated with self-conceit) and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy (diseased) interest in controversies and arguments (literally, quarrels about words), out of which comes envy, strife (conflict), malicious talk, evil suspicions, 5) and constant frictions among people who have corrupted minds. <they are=""> people who have been deprived (robbed) of the truth. They think that godliness is a way to financial gain (get money).

3）若有人传异教，不服从我们主耶稣基督纯正的话与那敬虔的教导，4）他是自高自大，一无所知。他对争吵和辩论有一种病态的兴趣，因此制造了嫉妒、纷争、毁谤、罪恶的怀疑5）并腐化堕落者之间的相互抵触。他们已经丧失了真理，把敬虔当成得利的门路。


6) Godliness with contentment is a way to great gain. 7) For we brought nothing into the world and we are not able to take anything out <of it="">. 8) If we have <enough> food and clothing, we will be content with those. 9) Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which drown (plunge) people into ruin and destruction. 10) For the love of money (literally, silver) is a root of many evils. Some people who long for (literally, stretch themselves out for) money have strayed (wandered) from the faith and have pierced themselves through with many griefs (painful sorrows).


6）然而，敬虔加上知足的心便是巨大的财富。7）因为我们没有带什么到世上来，也不能带什么去，8）只要有衣有食，就当知足。9）但那些想要发财的人，就陷在迷惑、落在网罗和许多无知有害的私欲里。这私欲将他们毁坏、使他们灭亡。10）贪财是万恶之根！有人贪恋钱财，就被引诱离了真道，被许多愁苦刺透。


11) But you, person of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience (patient endurance), <and> gentleness. 12) Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life, to which you were called <when> you confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13) I give you this duty (charge you) in the presence (sight) of God, who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate. 14) Keep this command without spot (stain) and without blame until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15) This <god> will make known in His own favorable time. <god is=""> the supremely blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16) who alone is immortal, who dwells in (inhabits) unapproachable light, <and> whom no one among people has seen or is able to see. To Him be honor and power forever. Amen.


11）但你这属神的人要逃避那些事，要追求公义、敬虔、信心、爱心、忍耐和温柔。12）你要奋力为真道去做美好的争战，抓住永生。你为此被召，正如你在许多见证人面前所做的美好声明。13）我在赐给万物生命的神面前，以及在向本丢彼拉多作过那美好见证的基督耶稣面前嘱咐你：14）要守这命令，毫不玷污，无可指责，直到我们的主耶稣基督显现。15）到了日期，那可称颂、独有权能的万王之王、万主之主，16）就是那独一永存，住在人不能靠近的光里，是人未曾看见，也是不能看见的神，要将他显明出来。但愿尊贵和永远的权能都归给他。阿门！


17) Command those who are rich in this present age not to be arrogant, nor to put their hope in the uncertainty of wealth, but rather <to put="" their="" hope="" in=""> God, who provides for us richly with all things for our enjoyment. 18) <command them="" also=""></command> to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous <and> willing to share. 19) By doing this, they will store away treasures for themselves as a good foundation for the coming age, so they may take hold of the true life.

17）你要嘱咐那些今世富足的人，不要自高，也不要把盼望放在无定的钱财上；而要把盼望放在那厚赐百物给我们享受的神身上。18）又要嘱咐他们行善，在好行为上富足，甘心施舍并且乐意与人分享，19）让自己所积攒的财宝，能为将来的世代打好根基，可以抓住真正的生命。

20) O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Turn away from godless, empty discussions and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 21) which some have professed and, <in this="" way="">, have swerved (deviated) from the faith. Grace be with you <all>.

20）提摩太啊，你要护卫所托付你的。躲避那些不敬畏神、无意义的谈论，以及那敌真道、似是而非的学问。有人自称有这学问，反而偏离了真道。愿恩惠常与你们同在！


#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 要学习和思考的事情

1. In verses 1-2, Paul instructs Christians who are in slavery to fully respect their masters so that God’s name will not be dishonored by any disrespectful behavior. He also urges them not to think that they can show less respect to a Christian master because he is a believer. Rather, slaves with a Christian master are to serve them better because it is a fellow believer who benefits from their service and who has a special bond of faith and love with them.


    在第1-2节中，保罗教导作奴仆的基督徒要完全尊敬他们的主人，使神的名不会因为任何无礼的行为而受到羞辱。他还要求他们不要因为他们的主人同是基督徒，就以为可以对他们表达更少的敬意。相反，有基督徒主人的奴仆反要更好地服侍他们的主人，因为得他们服侍益处的人也是一同信主的，与他们有着信仰和爱的特殊连结。

2. In verses 3-5, Paul reveals the characteristics and motivations of false teachers and points out the damage they do. False teachers sinfully oppose the true, godly teaching of Jesus Christ Himself. They are defiant and arrogant toward God and His Word and are without true spiritual understanding. They are interested in spreading their rebellious teachings that cause great division and unrest among people and that deprive them of God’s saving truth. In their selfishness, they also view religion as a way to enrich themselves financially.

    在第3-5节中，保罗揭露假教师的特征和动机，指出他们造成的损害。假教师罪恶地敌对有关耶稣基督本人的真实虔敬教导。他们公然违抗并藐视神和他的话语，并不真正明白属灵的事情。他们对传播自己悖逆的教导感兴趣，在人之间造成分歧和不安。他们丧失了神的救恩真理。他们自私地把宗教当成让他们经济上富足的门路。

3. In verses 6-10, Paul urges Christians to recognize the great gain that comes from adding contentment to their godly course of life. He reminds us that we enter the world with no material things and that we can take nothing with us into the next life. We are to find contentment in having a sufficient supply of food, clothing and shelter. People who long for material wealth beyond what is necessary for them are foolishly falling into a trap that drowns people in spiritual harm and destruction. Some people have fallen so deeply in love with the desire for money that they have deserted the true treasure of the Christian faith and have brought many painful sorrows on themselves.

    在第6-10节中，保罗要基督徒认识到来自知足和敬虔生活的巨大收获。他提醒我们，我们到世界上来的时候，什么也没有带来；我们离开这个世界的时候，什么也不能带走。我们应该对拥有足够的衣食和住所感到满足。那些渴望得到超过他们所需的物质财富的人，就无知地落入网罗，给自己的灵命造成伤害和毁灭。有些人深深地陷入贪恋钱财之中，离弃了对基督的真实宝贵信仰，给自己带来很多痛苦。

4. In verses 11-16, Paul reminds Timothy that he (Timothy) is God’s person. Paul calls on Timothy to flee from all sin and pursue the life of Christian living and virtues. He directs Timothy to fight to retain his faith so that he can enjoy the blessing of eternal life. He reminds Timothy of the previous confession and vows of allegiance that he has made to God. He urges Timothy to carry out these duties faithfully and blamelessly until Christ’s return. Paul then proceeds to offer a beautiful statement of praise to God who is the one and only King and Ruler and who is deathless and majestic in His glory and power.

    在第11-16节中，保罗提醒提摩太，他（提摩太）是属于神的人。保罗呼吁提摩太要逃避罪，追求基督徒的生活和美德。他指示提摩太要奋力争战以持守信心，使他能享受永生的福份。他提醒提摩太先前向神作的声明和誓言。他恳求提摩太忠心、无可指责地完成这些责任，直到基督再来。然后保罗向神发出美丽的颂词：神是那独一的君王和统治者，他永远不死的神，尊贵、荣耀和权能都是他的。

5. In verses 17-19, Paul instructs Timothy to command wealthy Christians to put their faith and hope in God and not in their earthly riches. He directs that wealthy believers are to use their riches to do good works and to generously and willingly serve others in their need. These actions will be in keeping with people who know that their true wealth is the spiritual and eternal riches that God gives them.

    在第17-19节中，保罗指示提摩太，要让那些富足的基督徒把信心和盼望放在神的身上，而不是在世界的财富上。他指导那些富足的信徒，要用他们的财富去行善，慷慨乐意地服侍那些有需要的人。这样的行为才与他们的认识一致—-他们的真正财富是神给他们的属灵和永恒的财富。


6. In verses 20-21, Paul again charges Timothy to guard the Word of God that has been entrusted to him and to faithfully carry out his ministry of that Word to God’s people. Timothy is to avoid the false wisdom of spiritual error of others and so remain in the true faith. Paul closes the letter by speaking God’s blessing of underserved love in Christ for Timothy and all those with him in Ephesus.

    在第20-21节中，保罗又告诫提摩太要护卫神的话，神曾委托给他，并要他向神的子民忠心教导。要提摩太躲避其他那些人的属灵谬误中的假智慧，并能持守真道。保罗提到神在基督里对提摩太和所有与他同在以弗所之人的爱—人不配得的爱，并以此结束他的书信。
