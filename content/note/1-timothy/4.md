#### B. Translation 翻译 

1) The <holy>Spirit clearly says that in later times (periods of opportunity), some will abandon (withdraw from) the faith <and>follow (be devoted to) deceiving (misleading) spirits and teachings of demons. 2) <these come="">through the hypocrisy of those who speak falsely (lie) and who have been burned and branded in their own consciences. 3) They forbid <people>to marry. They <command people=""></command>to keep away (abstain from) foods which God created (made) to be received (consumed) with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth well. 4) For everything made by God is good and nothing is to be rejected (refused) if it is received with thanksgiving 5) because it has been made holy (pure) through the Word of God and the prayer of request. 

1）圣灵明说：在后来的时候，必有人退出信仰、离弃真道，听从、专注于那引诱、误导人的邪灵和鬼魔的道理。2）这些都来自说谎者的伪善。他们的良心已被烧毁，像是被烙铁烙过一样。3）他们禁止人嫁娶，又禁止人吃某些食物。而这些食物是神为人类创造的，让相信并且明白真道的人心存感谢享用的。4）因为神所造的一切都是好的。只要人带着感恩的心领受，就没有一样是该拒绝的。5）它们已经因为神的话和人的祈求祷告而变得洁净。 

6) If you point these things out to the brothers (fellow Christians), you will be a good servant (minister) of Christ Jesus, trained up (educated in) the doctrines (truths) of the faith and of the good instruction that you have followed. 7) Avoid the ungodly (godless) and foolish (literally, like silly old women) made-up stories (fictions). Instead, train yourself to be godly. 8) For physical training is valuable for some things (of some value), but godliness is valuable for all things. It holds promise <of good="">both for this life and for the coming life. 

6）如果你能把这些事向一同信主的人指出来，你就是基督耶稣的好仆人，在信心的真道和你遵行的良好教导上是受过操练的人。7）要避免不敬神的、老妇虚构的荒谬故事。相反，你要在热爱和崇敬神上操练自己。8）操练身体虽有一些益处，但操练敬虔在各方面都有益处，因里面包含着今生和来生的美好应许。 

9) This is a trustworthy saying and worthy (deserving) of complete acceptance: 10) – and for this we work hand and strive – that we have put our confidence in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers. 11) Command (Proclaim) and teach these things. 12) Let no one despise you because you are young; rather be an example for the believers in speech, in behavior (life conduct), in love, in faith, in purity. 13) Until I come, dedicate (devote) yourself to public reading of Scripture, to encouragement (proclamation), to teaching. 14) Do not carelessly neglect your spiritual gift which was given to you through a prophetic message in connection with the laying on of the hands of the spiritual leaders (elders). 15) Take care of these things. Give yourself entirely to them so that your progress may be evident to all. 16) Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching (doctrine). Persevere in them, because by doing this, you will save yourself and your hearers. 

9）这话是可信的，值得完全接受。10）我们的劳苦努力也正是为此，因我们的指望是永生神；他是万人的救主，更是信徒的救主。11）这些事你要吩咐人也要教导人。12）不可叫人小看你年轻，总要在言语、行事为人、爱心、信心、清洁上，都作信徒的榜样。13）你要专心去做宣读圣经、劝勉、教导的事工，直到我来。14）你不要大意地忽视了你的属灵恩赐，就是从前籍着预言，借众长老按手赐给你的。15）你要留意去做这些事情，让自己专注其中，使众人能看出你的明显长进。16）你要谨慎自己和自己的教训。要在这些事上恒心，因为这样行既能救自己，也能救听你的人。 

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 学习和思考的事情 

1. In verses 1-2, Paul issues a warning from the Holy Spirit that in future times, people would forsake the Christian faith and instead be devoted to follow lying messengers who promote demon-inspired heresies. These false teachers would be deceptive in their teaching and hardened in their souls as they cleverly tried to pass off spiritual lies as God’s truth. 

    在第1-2节中，保罗从圣灵发出警告：在以后的日子，会有人离弃基督信仰的真道，转去听从那些散布来自鬼魔邪说之人的谎言。这些假教师的教训里充满了诡诈。他们的心灵麻木，狡猾地把属灵的谎言当作神的真理在传播。 

2. In verses 3-5, Paul reveals the heart of their spiritual error. The false teachers would command people to abstain from things such as marriage and eating certain foods as the spiritual path to spiritual fulfillment and God’s favor. Their promotion of an ascetic life to earn God’s favor sharply contradicts the truth that God has given us the gifts of His created world to be received with thanksgiving and properly used for our blessing. The misguided teaching that people can gain spiritual favor by their works of abstaining from certain foods and practices is prevalent in many false religions and is a strong denial of God’s teaching that salvation is His gift of grace to undeserving people through Jesus Christ. 

    在第3-5节中，保罗揭露那些属灵谬误的根本所在。假教师要求人禁止婚嫁，禁戒某些食物，以此作为完善属灵生命、得蒙神悦纳的属灵通道。他们这种通过鼓励禁欲苦行赢得神喜悦的做法，与神的真理形成尖锐的矛盾。那些东西是神在创造世界时赐给我们的礼物，只要我们感恩领受并恰当使用，就是神给我们的祝福。这种误入歧途的教训让人们以为，人可以通过克制不吃某些食物以及不做某些事情的个人努力，赢得属灵的恩惠。这种教训在许多假宗教中很普遍。它极端地否认了神的教训，即救恩是神借助耶稣基督赐给不配得之人的恩惠礼物。 

3. In verses 6-8, Paul encourages Timothy to be a good servant of Christ by teaching God’s Word faithfully to others. He urges Timothy to continue to grow in his knowledge of God’s Word and to avoid ungodly, foolish myths. He also directs Timothy to train himself in godliness which has enduring value in all things. 

    第6-8节，保罗鼓励提摩太作基督的好仆人，忠心地向人教导神的话。他劝勉提摩太继续在神的话语上长进，避免不敬畏神的虚构荒谬的讲论。他还引导提摩太在敬虔上操练自己，因为那会给他在一切的事情上都带来长远的益处。 

4. In verses 9-10, Paul shares the vital and energizing truth of the Gospel: “God is the Savior of all people. Believers who trust in God’s salvation especially benefit from this blessed, delivering message. 

    在第9-10节中，保罗分享了至关重要，激励人心的福音真理：“神是万人的救主。相信神救恩的信徒尤其从这个蒙福的救赎信息中得到益处。” 

5. In verses 11-13, Paul commands Timothy to refuse to let others look down on him because he is young. Instead, Timothy is to set a worthy example for other believers by the kind of life he lives. Timothy is also to devote himself to the public preaching and teaching of God’s Word to others. 

    第11-13节，保罗要求提摩太不要让人因为他年轻而看不起他，反要用自己的生活行为在信徒当中树立可敬的榜样。提摩太也要在公开讲道和给他人教导神的话语上全心去做。 

6. In verses 14-16, Paul encourages Timothy to use his spiritual gifts for ministry faithfully and to persevere in making progress in his Christian life and teaching. Timothy is to keep a close watch over his faith and his ministry and to persevere in them so that he and others will be saved. 

    在第14-16节中，保罗鼓励提摩太在福音事工上忠心地使用自己的恩赐，恒心追求在基督徒生命和教导上的长进。提摩太要特别警惕自己的信心和侍奉，在其中坚持不懈，使自己和别人都能得救。
