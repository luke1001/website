#### B. Translation 翻译 

1) The saying is trustworthy: ‘If anyone desires the position of leading (supervising) a church, he desires a noble work. 2) Now it is necessary that one who leads (supervises) a church be blameless (beyond rebuke), the husband of <only>one wife, temperate, self-controlled (sound in judgment), behaving well, hospitable (literally, “loving the stranger”), able to teach, 3) not addicted to alcohol (literally, “staying near wine”), not violent, but gentle (patient), not quarrelsome (literally, “not a fighter”), not loving money. 4) He must lead (manage) his own family (household) well, having his children in submission with complete reverence (respect). 5) For if a person does not know how to lead his own family (household), how can he take care of God’s Church? 6) <he must="">not <be>a new (recent) convert so that he does not become conceited (inflated with pride) and fall into the condemnation (judgment) of the devil. 7) It is also necessary that he have a good reputation with (report from) those who are on the outside <of the="" church="">so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the trap of the devil. 

1） “如果有人渴慕管理教会的职务，那他就是在渴慕一个高尚的职务。” 这话是可信的。2）一个管理教会的人，必须无可指责；只作一个妇人的丈夫，温和、自守，判断公正；有好行为，乐意接待远人，善于教导；3）不好饮酒，不凶狠；温良忍耐，不喜欢争吵，不打架，不贪财。4）他必须管好自己的家，使儿女凡事端庄、顺服。5）他若不知道怎样把自己的家管好，怎能照管好神的教会呢？6）他不能是一个新信徒，免得他自高自大，就落入魔鬼所受的刑罚里。7）他也必须在教会以外有好名声，恐怕被人毁谤，落在魔鬼的网罗里。 

8) In the same way, church workers (deacons) are to be reverent (worthy of respect), not two-faced (literally, “two-tongued), not indulging in (being devoted to) too much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. 9) They must hold on to the deep spiritual truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 10) Also, they must first be tested for approval. Then, if they are blameless (there is nothing against them), they may serve as church workers (deacons).

8）做教会工人（执事）的，也是如此：必须配受人敬重，不一口两舌，不好酒，不贪不义之财。9）要存清洁的良心，固守信心的属灵真理。10）同样，他们也必须首先经过试验，获得认可。若没有可责之处，然后再叫他们作执事。 

11) In the same way, women are to be reverent (worthy of respect), not malicious talkers (slanderers), temperate, faithful (trustworthy) in all things. 12) Church workers (deacons) are to be the husbands of <only>one wife and must lead (manage) their children and their own households well. 13) Those who serve well gain (acquire) a good standing for themselves and a great confidence to speak openly about the faith in Christ Jesus. 

11）妇女也是如此：必须值得尊敬，不说谗言，有节制，凡事忠心。12）执事只要作一个妇人的丈夫，好好管理儿女和自己的家。13）因为善作执事的，不仅为自己赢得好名声，并且对耶稣基督的信仰能够大有胆量地公开见证。 

14) Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing these things to you 15) so that if I delay (am slow to come), you will know how <people>ought to conduct <themselves>in the household of God, which is the Church of the living God., the pillar (support) and foundation (base) of the truth. 16) This is confessed with great conviction: Great is the mystery (divinely revealed secret) that produces godliness. He <jesus>was revealed in a physical way (in a body). He was declared to be true and correct (justified) in a spiritual way (by the Spirit). He was seen by angels. He was proclaimed among the nations. He was believed on in the world. He was taken up in glory. 

14）尽管我希望能尽快到你那里去，我还是把这些事写给你。15）倘若我耽延，你也可以知道在神家中的人当怎样行事为人。这家就是永生神的教会，真理的柱石和根基。16）这伟大敬虔的奥秘啊！无人不以为然，就是：耶稣基督在肉身显现；被圣灵宣告为真实公义；他被天使看见；被传于外邦；被世人信服；被接在荣耀里。 

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 学习和思考的事情 

1. In verse 1, Paul begins his section on instructions for church leaders by offering encouraging praise for those Christian men who undertook the challenging (and, at that time, the dangerous) position of overseer. Overseers were responsible for leading or supervising a church. This position was probably comparable to the position of a head pastor today. 

    在第1节中，保罗对那些承担管理教会职务的人提出鼓励和表扬，因为在那时，教会监督的工作极具挑战性，甚至带有危险。保罗以此开始他对教会领袖的指示。监督负责带领或管理教会。这个职务或许相当于今天的一个主任牧师。 
    
2. In verses 2-7, Paul gives the qualifications necessary for a man to serve in the position of leading a church. Such a man must live a blameless, moderate, sensible life in which he exercises sound judgment, and kindness to strangers. He must also be knowledgeable in God’s Word and able to teach it, not addicted to alcohol or in love with money. He must be gentle and not violent. He must be faithful to his wife (if married) and a capable, dignified leader of his family. He must be an experienced Christian who is not likely to be carried away with pride. He must also have a good reputation with people in the community who are outside the church. A person with strong Christian character and spiritual leadership gifts is prepared to be an effective leader in the church. 

    在第2-7节中，保罗提出了在领导教会这个岗位上侍奉的人所必须具备的资格。他的生活必须无可指责，有节制；他必须能明白事理，能做出公正判断，也能对陌生人乐善好施。他也必须精通神的话，善于教导；不好酒，不贪财。他必须温和，不凶狠。他对自己的妻子必须忠诚，在家庭中是能干、有尊严的领导。他必须是一个经验丰富的基督徒，不会因骄傲丧失理智。他也必须在教会以外的社区有好名声。一个具有坚实基督徒品格和属灵领导恩赐的人将会是教会中很得力的领袖。 
    
3. In verses 8-10 and 12, Paul sets forth the qualification necessary for a man who serves as a deacon. This was a position of special service in the church and likely involved administering the affairs of the church. The man who serves as a deacon must live a reverent, honest, moderate life. He must not be addicted to alcohol or be greedy. He must hold firmly and sincerely to the true Christian teachings. He must prove himself to be blameless and trustworthy. He must also be a faithful husband (if married) and must manage his family well. 

    在第8-10节和12节中，保罗提出在执事的职位上服侍的人应该具备的资格。这个职务所做的是教会的特殊服侍，很可能包括管理教会的各项事务。在执事的职务上服侍的人，生活必须敬虔，诚实，自制。他不能好酒，不贪财。他对纯正的基督信仰必须坚定、真诚地持守。他必须证明自己是无可指责、值得信任的。他也必须是一个忠诚的丈夫，也要把自己的家管好。 
    
4. In verse 11, Paul states the qualifications for the women who serve as special assistants to church leaders. Such women are to live respectable, moderate, trustworthy lives and not indulge in malicious, slanderous talk. In the early church, these women were called deaconesses. 

    在第11节中，保罗表明了为教会领袖作特别助理的妇女应具备的资格。这些妇女必须端庄，自守，可靠；不说谗言及毁谤的话。在早期教会中，这些妇女被称为女执事。 
    
5. In verse 13, Paul concludes this section on church workers by offering encouraging praise to those who serve well. God graciously rewards faithful church workers with blessings such as the respect and admiration of others and the confidence to be bold witnesses and encouragers of the Christian faith to others 

    在第13节中，保罗总结了教会工人的侍奉，表扬、鼓励了那些尽职尽忠的工人。神对忠心的教会工人给予丰富的祝福作为奖赏，使他们得到众人的尊敬和爱戴，也能在基督信仰上大胆地作见证，并能鼓励其他人的信心。 
    
6. In verses 14-15\. Paul expresses his wish to visit Timothy soon, but explains that he was giving these instructions in writing so that the people in God’s church would have them even if he was delayed on his trip. He emphasizes the special nature of the Church and the serious nature of these instruction when he tells us that the Church is: 1) God’s dear family; 2) the sacred place in which God lives; and 3) the foundation and pillar that supports the truth of the gospel. 

    在第14-15节中，保罗表达了希望不久能去看望提摩太的愿望，但他解释说，他把这些指示写下来，目的是在他耽搁的情况下，神教会的人也能知道当怎样行事为人。他告诉我们教会是：1）与神有着亲密关系的家庭；2）神在其中居住的神圣居所；3）支持福音真理的根基和柱石。他借着这些话强调了教会的特殊本质，以及这些教训的严肃性。 
    
7. In verses 16-17, Paul offers special praise to Jesus Christ, who is the essence of God’s truth and the Head of the Church. Paul refers to Jesus as as the “mystery” (that is, “the divinely revealed secret”) of our godliness and religion. He offers a hymn of adoration to Christ. The six lines of the hymn and their meaning follows: 

    在第16-17节中，保罗特别地赞美了耶稣基督，他是神真理的实质，是教会的元首。保罗把耶稣视为我们敬虔和信仰的“奥秘”（是神启示的奥秘）。他向基督献上了崇拜的诗歌。这六行的圣诗极其意义如下： 
    
    Line 1) “He appeared in a physical way” = The Son of God humbled Himself, took on a human nature, and lived in the world as a lowly human being. 
    
    第一行：“他在肉身显现”：神的儿子自己降卑，取了人的性情，作为一个卑微的人活在世上。 
    
    Line 2) “He was declared to be true and correct in a spiritual way” = Jesus was publicly declared by God to be the true Son of God and Savior of the world by His resurrection from the dead. Jesus now lives in the spiritual state of exalted glory. 
    
    第二行：“他被圣灵宣告为真实、正义”：耶稣公开地被神宣告为神的真儿子，从死里复活而成为世人的救主。耶稣现在以灵体住在至高的荣耀里。 
    
    Line 3) “He was seen by angels” = Jesus was seen by human witnesses who served as His angels or messengers to others. (See Luke 9:52 and Revelation 1:20 for the use of the Greek word “angelos” to refer to human messengers of God’s Word) Another explanation is that the holy angels witnessed Jesus’ saving work and then announced it to people. (See Matthew 4:11, Matthew 28:5) 
    
    第3行：“他被天使看见”：耶稣被服侍他的天使以及向他人传信息的见证人看见。（参路加9：52；启1：20，查看希腊语“angelos（使者）”指传递神话语的人）。另一种解释是，圣天使见证了耶稣的救赎工作，然后向人宣告这个信息。（参马太4：11，太28：5） 
    
    Line 4) “He was proclaimed among the nations” = God’s Word about Jesus was announced by His messengers to people of the nations of the world. 
    
    第4行：“他被传于外邦”：神的话中有关耶稣基督的信息被他的信使传到世界各国的人们。 
    
    Line 5) “He was believed on in the world” = People all around the world were brought to faith in Jesus as their Savior. 
    
    第5行: “他被世人相信”：信心赐给了全世界的人，使他们都能接受耶稣作他们的救主。 
    
    Line 6) “He was taken up in glory” = Jesus ascended to heaven’s throne at God’s right hand to rule over all things. 
    
    第6行：“他被接在荣耀里”：耶稣升到天上的宝座，坐在神的右边，统治万有。
