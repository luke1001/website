#### B. Translation 翻译 

1)I urge, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercessions, <and>thanksgivings be made on behalf of all people 2) – for kings and all those in authority so that we may lead a quiet (tranquil) and peaceful (untroubled) life in all godliness and reverence. 3) This is good and is pleasing (acceptable) in the sight of God, our Savior 4) who wants all people to be saved and to come into a full knowledge of the truth. 5) For there is one God and there is one Mediator between God and people, the human being (person) Christ Jesus, 6）who gave Himself as a ransom for all – the testimony <to be="" given="">in this time of opportunity. 7) For this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle – I am telling the truth – I am not lying – a teacher of the nations (Gentiles) in the faith and truth. 

1）我恳求你，第一要为万人祈求、祷告、代求，并为他们感恩；2）为君王和一切在位掌权的，也该如此，使我们可以在敬虔、恭敬中，过平静无扰的生活。3）这在神我们救主眼中看为美善，蒙他喜悦的。4）他愿意万人得救，明白全备的真道。5）因为只有一位神，在神和人中间只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的耶稣基督。6）他舍自己作万人的赎价—这个证据要在适当的时候显明出来。7）我正是为了这个目的被委任作传道的，作使徒，作外邦人的师傅，教导他们有关信心和真理的事。我在这里说的是实话，并无谎言。 

8) Therefore, I want men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and disputing (debating). 9) In a similar way, < I want > women to beautify themselves with modesty and self-control (sound judgment), not with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing, 10) but rather with good works which is fitting for women who profess reverence for God. 11) A woman should learn in quietness and in complete submission (subjection). 12) I do not permit (allow) a woman to teach or to take authority (have authority) over a man, but she is to be in quietness (silence), 13) because Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14) Also Adam was not deceived. It was the woman who was thoroughly deceived and became a sinner (literally, “a breaker of the law”). 15) However, the woman will be saved through childbearing (maternity) – if they remain in faith and love and holiness with self-control (sound judgment). 

8）因此，我愿各地各方的男人们，举起圣洁的手来祷告，无愤怒，无争论。9）同样，我愿女人用得体的服装、公正自守来装饰自己，不要用编发、黄金、珍珠或贵重的衣裳打扮自己。10）既然自称是敬畏神的女人，就要用相应的善行来装饰自己。11）女人应该安静学习，完全顺服。12）我不允许女人教导男人，也不许女人的权力超过男人，只要她沉静。13）因为先造的是亚当，后造的是夏娃；14）且不是亚当被引诱，乃是女人被引诱，陷在罪里。15）然而，女人若长存信心、爱心、又圣洁公正、有自制，就必因生产得救。 

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 学习和思考的事情 

1. In verses 1-2, Paul urges to address God on behalf of all people in ways that express our trusting dependence on Him (requests), in ways that express our deep reverence for Him (prayers), in ways that express our unquestioning confidence in Him (intercessions); and in ways that express our heartfelt gratitude toward Him (thanksgiving). He specially emphasizes that prayers be offered for those who are in positions of governing authority so that believers may be able to live godly lives and carry out their Christian mission without special troubles and disturbances. 

    在第1-2节中，保罗鼓励我们为万人祷告代求，表达我们对神的信任和依靠（祈求），对神深深的的敬畏（祷告），对神无可置疑的信心（代求）；并表达我们对神发自内心的感激（感恩）。他特别强调要为那些执政掌权者祷告，使信徒能敬虔地生活，并能不受特殊干扰和麻烦地完成他们的基督徒使命。 

2. In verses 3-4, Paul explains that such prayers of intercession are pleasing to God because His primary desire is that all people receive His salvation and come to know the blessings of His saving truth. 
2\. 
    悦的，因为神的基本心意是要所有的人接受他的救恩，来认识他救赎真理的福分。 

3. In verses 5-6, Paul affirms the vital truths that there is only one true God and only One Mediator, Jesus Christ, who established peace for sinful people with a holy God by paying the ransom price for the souls of all people. He ransomed all by offering Himself to God as the sinless Substitute for sinners and the sufficient Sacrifice for their sins. 

    在第5-6节中，保罗确认了这一基要真理：真神只有一位，也只有一位中保—耶稣基督，他为所有人的灵魂付上了救赎的代价，为罪人与圣洁之神之间建立了和平。他作为无罪的替代品，为有罪的人把自己交给神，为他们的罪作了完全的赎罪祭。 

4. In verse 7, Paul states that God had chosen and appointed him to be one who announces God’s gracious message and who is sent out with Christ’s authority to teach God’s saving truth to the Gentiles. 

    在第7节中，保罗声明，神已选派他成为宣告神恩典信息的人，并派他用基督的权柄对外邦人教导神的救赎真理。 

5. In verse 8, Paul instructs the men to lead the prayers offered in public worship with a spirit of unity that is free of anger and arguments. 

    在第8节中，保罗教导男人在带领公共崇拜的祷告时，要有合一的灵，不可有怒气和争论。 

6. In verses 9-10, Paul instructs the women to beautify themselves for public worship by dressing not with costly, extravagant outward attire, but in a modest and sensible way with a spirit of reverence and a life of good works. 

    在第9-10节中，保罗教导女人在公共崇拜中不应穿昂贵奢华的衣服，而要端庄得体，心存敬畏，生活中有善行。 

7. In verses 11-14, Paul teaches that women are not to be the leaders or teachers in public worship as they respect God’s principle that they be under the authority of men. God established this principle at creation when He gave Adam headship over the Eve. God reestablished this principle the Fall into Sin when He affirmed man’s leadership over woman. 

    在第11-14节中，保罗教导女人在公共崇拜中不要作领导或教师，要她们尊重神所定的原则：女人在男人的权下。神在起初创造时定了这个原则，他让亚当作了夏娃的头。神在人堕落之后又重立了这个原则，他确立了男人对女人的领导地位。 

8. In verse 15, Paul teaches that woman has a unique role to play as wife and mother. Women will be saved as they continue in faith in Christ and in obedience to God’s will. 

    在第15节中，保罗教导说，女人有一个作妻子和母亲的独特角色。妇女若能持守对基督的信心，顺服神的旨意，就能得到救赎。
