#### B. Translation 翻译 

1) Do not rebuke (reprimand) an older man harshly, but encourage him as <if he="" were="" your="">father. Encourage younger men as brothers, 2) older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all purity. 3) Honor widows who are really widows. 4) But if a certain widow has children or grandchildren (literally, descendants), they are to learn, first of all, to give respectful support to their own family (household) and to give payment back to their parents, for this is acceptable before God. 5) The one who really is a widow and who has been left all alone puts her hope in God and continues with requests and prayers night and day. 6) But the <widow>who lives rebelliously for pleasure has died <spiritually>even while living <physically>. 7) Command (Proclaim) these things in order that they may be blameless. 8) If a person does not provide for his own relatives and especially for his own family (household), he has rejected the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 

1）不可严责老年人，只要劝他如同你的父亲。劝少年人如同弟兄；2）劝老年妇女如同母亲；劝少年妇女如同姐妹；要完全清洁。3）要尊敬那真为寡妇的。4）若寡妇有儿女，或有孙子、孙女等后代，他们便首先要在自己家中学着行孝，回报他们的父母，因为这是令神满意的做法。5）那独居无靠真为寡妇的，要仰赖神，昼夜不住祈求祷告。6）但那些悖逆好宴乐的寡妇，即使肉体活着，灵已经死了。7）这些事你要嘱咐她们，使她们无可指责。8）人若不看顾自己的亲属，尤其是他自己的家人，就是背离了信仰，比不信的人还不好。 

9) Let a widow be enrolled who is not less than sixty years old, was the wife of one husband, 10) is well regarded for her works: whether she raised children; whether she has shown hospitality; whether she washed the feet of saints; whether she has given assistance to those who are suffering (in trouble); whether she had devoted herself to (literally, followed after) every good work. 

9）登记在册的寡妇，必须超过六十岁、只作过一个丈夫的妻子，10）有行善的名声，比如养育儿女，接待远人，给圣徒洗脚，救济遭难的人，竭力行各样的善事。 

11) Refuse <to enroll="">younger widows. For when their sensual desires rise up against <their promise="" to="" be="" supported="" by="" the="" church="" of="" christ="">, they want to marry. 12) They have set aside (broken) their first pledge (belief). 13) They also learn to be useless (lazy), wandering about the houses – and, not only lazy, - but also gossips and meddlers (those who interfere in other people’s matters), saying things they should not say. 14) So I want younger widows to marry, raise children, <and>manage their homes (households), in order to give the one who opposes not even one opportunity for slander. 15) For, in fact, some have already turned away to follow Satan. 16) If a woman has widows <in her="" family="">, she should help them and not let the church be burdened, so that <the church="">can help those who are in genuine need. 

11）不要登记年轻的寡妇。因为当她们的情欲发动，不愿遵守受基督教会支持的承诺时，就想要嫁人。12）她们已经违背了起初的誓约。13）并且她们又习惯懒惰，挨家闲游；不但是懒惰，又说长道短，好管闲事，说些不该说的话。14）所以我愿意年轻的寡妇嫁人，生养儿女，治理家务，给那些敌对的人没有一个毁谤的机会。15）因为有些人实际上已经转去随从撒旦了。16）信主的妇女，若家中有寡妇，自己就当救济她们，不可累着教会，好使教会能够救济那些真无依靠的寡妇。 

17) The church workers (elders) who lead well (literally, stand before others) are worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in proclaiming (preaching) and teaching <god’s word="">. 18) For the Scripture says: “Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain” and “The worker is deserving of his wages.” 19) Do not accept an accusation against a church worker (elder) unless it is brought> by two or three witnesses. 20) Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest will take warning. 21) I give you this duty (charge you), in the presence of God, Christ Jesus, and the elect (chosen) angels, that you keep these instructions impartially (without preferring one person before another), and do nothing out of favoritism. 

17）善于管理教会的工人（长老）配受加倍的敬重，尤其是那些努力传道教导神话语的人。18）因为经上说：“牛在场上踹谷的时候，不可笼住它的嘴。”又说：“工人得工价是应当的。”19）对教会同工（长老）的控告，如果没有两三个见证就不要收。20）要在众人面前责备那些犯罪的人，使其余的人都可以得到警告。21）我在神和基督耶稣并蒙拣选的天使面前嘱咐你：要遵守这些话，不可存成见，行事也不可有偏心。 

22) Do not place your hands quickly on anyone. Do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. 23) Stop drinking <only>water. Use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. 

22）不要匆忙地给任何人做按手礼；不要在别人的罪上有份，要保守自己清洁。23）不要只喝水。因为你的胃病和你经常患病的缘故，可以稍微用点酒。 

24) The sins of some people are clearly evident. They reach the place of judgment ahead of them, while the sins of others follow behind them. 25) In the same way, good deeds are clearly evident – and even the ones that are regarded otherwise cannot be hidden. 

24）有些人的罪是明显的，审判他们的地方就在他们前面；而另一些人的罪在他们后面跟着他们。25）同样，善行也是明显的，即使那些被看作是不明显的善行，也是藏不住的。 

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 学习和思考的事情 

1. In verses 1-2, Paul teaches believers to treat fellow Christians as loved and respected family members as they speak and work with them. People are to treat older men as a father, older women as a mother, younger men as brothers, and younger women as sisters. 

    在第1-2节中，保罗教导信徒在与其他基督徒说话、做事时，要爱他们、尊敬他们如同家人。要待老年人如同父亲，待老年妇女如同母亲，待少年人如同弟兄，待少年妇女如同姐妹。 
    
2. In verses 3-8, Paul begins instruction on how Christians are to care for widows. In Paul’s time, widows faced economic hardships because they did not have many opportunities to earn income or to receive help from government support programs. Most often, they depended on the kindness of others for support. Paul gives guidelines to help the church determine its responsibilities toward Christian widows. 

    在第3-8节中，保罗开始教导基督徒当怎样照料寡妇。在保罗的时代，寡妇面临着经济上的困境，因为他们没有多少机会获得收入，或者接受政府资助项目的帮助。他们常常依靠别人的好心来维持生活。保罗提出的指导原则帮助教会决定供养基督徒寡妇的责任。 
    
    Paul directs the church to identify and support those widows who had genuine need. These are the widows who trust in God and are devoted to Him and who have no family members to care for them (like Anna in Luke 2:36-38). Widows who have family members are to be supported by their family. Family members are to take their duty to care for needy relatives seriously. Widows who have forsaken their loyalty to God and who are living for their own pleasure are to be rebuked and called to repentance so they can regain spiritual life. 

    保罗指示教会要找出并支持那些有真正需要的寡妇。这些寡妇必须是信靠神、奉献给神的，并且没有家人照顾她们（比如路2：36-38节中的亚拿）。家中还有人的寡妇要由家人来供养。家庭成员要认真承担起照料有需要的亲属的责任。对神失去忠心、好宴乐的寡妇要受到责备，提醒她们悔改，使她们能重获属灵的生命。 
    
3. In verses 9-10, Paul explained which widows are to be enrolled in the church’s program of care for widows. These widows must be over 60 years old and must be woman who lived respectable, moral lives and who expressed their faith in lives of love and good works. 

    在第9—10节中，保罗指示，寡妇要在教会“照顾寡妇的登记册”中登记。这些寡妇必须在六十岁之上，也必须是端庄有德行的人。他们在爱人和善行的生活上能表现他们的信仰。 
    
4. In verses 11-16, Paul treats the matter of how the cases of younger widows should be handled. He counsels that younger widows should not be enrolled in the church’s program of support for widows. He explains that they may still wish to marry again and would be tempted to break their promise to remain widows as part of the church’s support program. Paul adds that the younger widows may also be tempted to become lazy gossipers who sinfully interfere in people’s lives. Paul advises that younger widows marry and raise families and use their energies and abilities in practical, honorable ways. Paul gives this advice from his personal experience of widows who had abandoned Christ and had fallen under Satan’s control. Paul concludes his treatment of this topic by stating the principle that a woman who has widows in her family should look after them so the church is not burdened with caring for them and can focus on helping those widows who have no one to support them. 

    在第11-16节中，保罗指出应当怎样处理年轻寡妇的问题。他建议不要把年轻寡妇登记在教会支持寡妇的计划册子上。他解释说，她们可能还希望再嫁，有可能会违背教会支持寡妇的要求，即必须一直是寡妇。保罗补充说，年轻寡妇也可能受诱惑而变得懒惰，说长道短，好管闲事。保罗建议年轻寡妇再嫁建立家庭，把自己的力量用在现实、可敬的事情上。保罗提出的这些建议，是根据他的个人经历中，有离弃基督而落入撒旦控制的寡妇。保罗总结了他对这个问题的处理，陈明这样的原则，即家中有寡妇的妇女要照料这些寡妇，使教会不受拖累，能专心帮助那些无依无靠的寡妇。 
    
5. In verses 17-18, Paul emphasizes the point that faithful church leaders, especially those who preach and teach God’s Word, are to be treated with special honor. He quotes the words of Moses in Deuteronomy 25:4 and the words of Jesus in Luke 10:7 to stress the point that such leaders are to receive sufficient financial support from the church members in appreciation for the service these leaders provide.

    在第17-18节中，保罗强调，对教会忠心的领袖，尤其是那些传讲和教导神话语的领袖，要给予他们特别的尊敬。他引用了摩西在申25：4节，以及耶稣在路10：7节里的话对这一点加以强调—为感激这些领袖的忠心服侍，教会成员应向这些领袖提供充足的经济支持。 
    
6. In verses 19-21, Paul treats the matters of handling accusations against church leaders and carrying out discipline for leaders who sin. Paul says that church leaders should be protected again groundless accusations by insisting that only accusations brought by a minimum of two or three credible witnesses be considered. Paul also teaches that church leaders who do sin openly are to be rebuked publicly so their cases will be a warning to other believers. He also insists that discipline cases are to be handled in a fair and impartial manner.    

    在第19-21节中，保罗处理了控告教会领袖、和对犯罪的领袖要给予惩戒的问题。保罗说，教会领袖应该在无根据的控告面前得到保护，如果没有至少两三个见证人的有效证据，就不要受理。保罗也教导，对那些确实公开犯罪的教会领袖，必须要在会众面前受到责备，使其他信徒也能得到警告。他也坚持，惩戒的事必须处理得公正，无偏见。 
    
7. In verse 22, Paul insists that church leaders be evaluated and chosen carefully before being put in their positions of authority. 

    在第22节中，保罗坚持教会领袖必须在认真评议与挑选之后，才能委以重任。 

8. In verse 23, Paul advises Timothy to take better care of his health by using wine for medicinal purposes. 

    在第23节中，保罗劝提摩太多留意自己的健康，可以为了医药的目的而用一些酒。 

9. In verse 24, Paul instructs God’s people to be careful in making judgments about others. because the good and evil works of people are sometimes evident and are sometimes not evident until a later time. 

    在第24节中，保罗指示神的子民在判断他人的事上一定要谨慎，因为人的善行和恶行有时是明显的，有时要到后来才能显出来。
