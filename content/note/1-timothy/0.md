#### “LEAD GOD’S CHURCH AND KEEP THE FAITH” 带领神的教会，持守信心

1 Timothy was one of the later biblical epistles that the Apostle Paul wrote. 

提摩太前书是使徒保罗所写的后期书信。

Paul wrote while on a visit to a return visit to mission fields in Macedonia, probably in 63: A.D., at about the same time that he wrote the letter to Titus. 

保罗的这封书信是他在回访福音工场马其顿期间写的，时间大约在公元后63年。大约与此同时，他还写了给提多的书信。

Timothy, the original receiver of the letter, was from Lystra in the Roman Province of Galatia. He was the son of a believing Jewish mother, Eunice, who taught him the Bible, and of a father who was a Greek. 

提摩太是最初接到书信的人。他是路司得人，属加拉太的罗马省会。他的母亲友妮基，是一位信神的犹太人，曾教导他圣经。他的父亲是希腊人。

Paul first met Timothy on his Second Missionary Journey, was impressed by his biblical faith, his good character, abilities and gift. Paul invited him to join the mission team. 

保罗初次遇到提摩太，是在他第二次旅行布道期间。提摩太对神话语的信心、他的美好品行、他的能力以及恩赐，给保罗留下了深刻的印象，于是保罗便邀请他加入到布道的行列。

Timothy had a very close spiritual relationship with Paul. At the time of the writing of 1 Timothy, he had worked as the apostle’s representative for twelve years. Timothy took on special assignments to serve the Church in places such as Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 3:1-2); Corinth (1 Corinthians 4:17); and Philippi (Philippians 2:20-22). 

提摩太和保罗在灵里的关系非常亲密。到写提摩太前书时，他作使徒的代表已经有12年。提摩太承担了服侍教会的特殊任务。他所服侍的教会所在的地方有帖撒罗尼迦（帖前3:1-2）；哥林多（林前4：17）；以及腓力比（腓2：20-22）。

Paul had assigned Timothy to carry out special duties at the church in Ephesus. Paul wrote the letter of 1 Timothy to review the verbal instructions that Paul gave Timothy for this assignment. 

保罗曾委派提摩太在以弗所教会中承担特别的事工。保罗写提摩太前书这封书信的目的即在于重述他曾给提摩太有关这个任务的口头指示。

The Holy Spirit inspired the Apostle Paul to write this letter for believers of all time. God’s Words in 1 Timothy continue to call on God’s people to combat false teaching, aggressively, to carry out the ministry of the Church carefully and to follow God’s Word faithfully. 

圣灵激励使徒保罗写这封书信给所有世代的信徒。神在提摩太前书中的话语继续呼吁神的子民坚决抵制错误教导，认真履行教会事工，并忠心遵行神的话语。
