路加福音 Luke 10:1-42
            In the previous lesson, Jesus sent out the twelve disciples. He continues to prepare His followers for the ministry that lies ahead of them when He is gone. Because of the great amount of work to be done, Jesus appointed 72 followers to represent Him.
在前面的学习中讲到了，耶稣差遣十二门徒。这里耶稣为了门徒在祂离世后将要面对的事工而不断地预备他们。因为有大量的事工要完成，耶稣进而指派了72位门徒来代表祂。

Jesus Sends Out the Seventy two 耶稣差遣七十人
1After this the Lord appointed seventy-twoothers and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. Who were these seventy-two? Why would they go out two by two? What was their job?  2He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. What are the followers of Jesus going to harvest? 3Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Why would they be like lambs among wolves? 4Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road. What instructions were the followers given
10:1这事以后，主又设立七十个人，差遣他们两个两个的，在他前面往自己所要到的各城各地方去。这七十二人是谁？为什么他们要两个两个一起出去？他们的工作是什么？10:2就对他们说，要收的庄稼多，作工的人少。所以你们当求庄稼的主，打发工人出去收他的庄稼。耶稣的门徒们要去收割什么？10:3你们去吧。我差你们出去，如同羊羔进入狼群。为什么他们会如羊羔进入狼群一般？10:4不要带钱囊，不要带口袋，不要带鞋。在路上也不要问人的安。这些门徒被给予了什么样的指导？
5"When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.' 6If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; What kind of peace? if not, it will return to you. 7Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. Why shouldn't they move around?
10:5无论进那一家，先要说，愿这一家平安。10:6那里若有当得平安的人，当得平安的人原文作平安之子你们所求的平安就必临到那家，什么样的平安？不然，就归与你们了。10:7你们要住在那家，吃喝他们所供给的。因为工人得工价，是应当的。不要从这家搬到那家。他们为什么不能从这家搬到那家？
8"When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you. 9Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.' What is the heart of Jesus message? 10But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. What does it mean to wipe of the dust against you? Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.' 12I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. What happened to Sodom?
10:8无论进那一城，人若接待你们，给你们摆上什么，你们就吃什么。10:9要医治那城里的病人，对他们说，神的国临近你们了。耶稣的这个教导的中心是什么？10:10无论进那一城，人若不接待你们，你们就到街上去，10:11说，就是你们城里的尘土，粘在我们的脚上，我们也当着你们擦去。当着你们擦去脚上的尘土，这是什么意思？虽然如此，你们该知道神的国临近了。10:12我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比那城还容易受呢。所多玛发生了什么事？
13"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. What did Jesus perform in those towns? What was the response? 14But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 15And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. What type of judgment is going to befall Capernaum?
10:13哥拉汛哪，你有祸了。伯赛大阿，你有祸了。因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰坐在地上悔改了。耶稣在这些城里行了什么事？这些城（对耶稣所作的）有什么回应？10:14当审判的日子，推罗西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢。10:15迦百农阿，你已经升到天上。（或作你将要升到天上吗？）将来必推下阴间。什么样的审判会临到迦百农？
    16"He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me." What assurance and warning does Jesus give to both speakers and hearers of Christ's message?
    17The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name." What results did the seventy-two experience?
18He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. What was Satan experiencing? 19I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. 20However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven." Why should the followers of Jesus rejoice?
10:16又对门徒说，听从你们的，就是听从我，弃绝你们的，就是弃绝我，弃绝我的，就是弃绝那差我来的。对于传讲基督和聆听基督信息的人，耶稣给与了什么样的担保和警告？
10:17那七十个人欢欢喜喜地回来说，主阿，因你的名，就是鬼也服了我们。这七十人得到了什么样的结果？
10:18稣对他们说，我曾看见撒但从天上坠落，像闪电一样。撒旦经历了什么？10:19我已经给你们权柄，可以践踏蛇和蝎子，又胜过仇敌一切的能力，断没有什么能害你们。10:20然而不要因鬼服了你们就欢喜，要因你们的名记录在天上欢喜。耶稣的门徒们为什么欢喜？
    21At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. What causes Jesus to rejoice?
    22"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." What is Jesus reminding His followers?
23Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 24For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." Why does Jesus privately tell His disciples they are blessed?
10:21正当那时，耶稣被圣灵感动就欢乐，说，父阿，天地的主，我感谢你，因为你将这些事，向聪明通达人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。父阿，是的，因为你的美意本是如此。什么使得耶稣欢乐？
10:22一切所有的，都是我父交付我的。除了父，没有人知道子是谁。除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父是谁。耶稣在提醒门徒们什么？
10:23耶稣转身暗暗地对门徒说。看见你们所看见的，那眼睛就有福了。10:24我告诉你们，从前有许多先知和君王，要看你们所看的，却没有看见。要听你们所听的，却没有听见。耶稣为什么暗暗地告诉门徒们他们是有福的？

The Parable of the Good Samarita好撒玛利亚人的比喻
    25On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Why ask this question? What do we do to “inherit eternal life”?26"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?" Why does Jesus answer him with two more questions?27He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; List the four ways to love the Lord. What do these four together mean? and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself. Who is “your neighbor”?28"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live." Is Jesus teaching that one can save himself by his own efforts? What is Jesus saying?29But he wanted to justify himself, Why does he need to justify himself? so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" What question should the man have asked Jesus?
10:25    有一个律法师，起来试探耶稣说，夫子，我该作什么才可以承受永生。律法师为什么会问这个问题？我们该作什么才可以承受永生呢？ 10:26    耶稣对他说，律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？耶稣为什么用另外两个问题来回答他呢？ 10:27    他回答说，你要尽心，尽性，尽力，尽意，爱主你的神。请列出四种爱神的方式。这四种方式有什么共同点呢？又要爱邻舍如同自己。谁是你的邻舍？ 10:28    耶稣说，你回答的是。你这样行，就必得永生。耶稣是说一个人可以靠自己的努力来救自己吗？耶稣说的是什么意思呢？ 10:29    那人要显明自己有理，那人为什么需要显明自己有理？就对耶稣说，谁是我的邻舍呢？那人本来应该问耶稣什么问题的？

30In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. Find Jerusalem and Jericho on the map. Do you think this man was a Jew?They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. Describe the man’s condition.31A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. What is a priest’s job? Can you remember the name of the priest from the first lesson? How does this priest respond to the man? 32So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. What does the Levite do when he sees the man?33But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. Why is this unusual?34He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Describe the care the man was given.Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. How else does the Samaritan care for the man? Who does the Samaritan not care for?35The next day he took out two silver coinsand gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' For what does this money pay? What promise does he make?
10:30    耶稣回答说，有一个人从耶路撒冷下耶利哥去，落在强盗手中，请在地图上找到耶路撒冷和耶利哥。你认为这个人是犹太人吗？他们剥去他的衣裳，把他打个半死，就丢下他走了。请描述一下这个人当时的状况。 10:31    偶然有一个祭司，从这条路下来。看见他就从那边过去了。祭司是做什么的？你能不能记起第一堂课上我们所讲到的那个祭司的名字？这个祭司看到那个被抢的人，他是怎么做的？ 10:32   又有一个利未人，来到这地方，看见他，也照样从那边过去了。利未人是如何做的？ 10:33    惟有一个撒玛利亚人，行路来到那里。看见他就动了慈心，撒玛利亚人的反应有什么不寻常的？ 10:34    上前用油和酒倒在他的伤处，包裹好了，请描述一下这个被抢的人受到了什么样的照顾？扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他。这个撒玛利亚人还对那人做了怎样的照料？撒玛利亚人对谁毫不关心？ 10:35    第二天拿出二钱银子来，交给店主说，你且照应他。此外所费用的，我回来必还你。这钱是用来付什么的？他还应许了什么？
    36"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" Why might this be a challenging question?
37The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." What name does the expert in the law not use? Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.” Will this be easy for the expert in the law? Why?
10:36    你想这三个人，那一个是落在强盗手中的邻舍呢？ 这为什么可能是一个具有挑战性的问题？10:37    他说，是怜悯他的。律法师没有直接说出谁的名字？耶稣说，你去照样行吧。 这对律法师来说容易做到吗？为什么？

What was Mary doing? 40But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. What kind of preparations do you think Martha had?
