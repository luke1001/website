路加福音 简介 Introduction Luke 1
Luke路加
Luke was probably a Gentile by birth, well educated in Greek culture, a physician by profession, and a companion of the Apostle of Paul at various times. The book of Luke was probably written in Rome and seems to be intended for strengthening the Christian faith and training those who were not so familiar with the Scriptures. Luke's vocabulary is rich and seems to reveal geographical and cultural sensitivity. Luke used personal investigation. He based his writings on interviews with eyewitnesses and oral accounts of the apostles and other individuals associated with Jesus ministry.
路加很可能是外邦人出身，在希腊文化下受过良好的教育，以医生为职，曾多次伴随保罗四处传道。路加福音可能是著于罗马，似是为了坚固信徒的信心并训练那些对圣经不熟悉的人而写的。路加的词汇很丰富并且反应了他对地理和文化的敏感性。同时路加还对当事人做了追踪调查，将他的作品建立在对目击者的采访和使徒们以及其他与耶稣传教事工的相关人的口述之上。
Luke's Gospel is the longest of the four Gospels. It forms a two-volume work with the book of Acts. Both books are addressed to Theophilus, whose name means "one who loves God". Theophilus was thought to be a Roman official or at least someone of high position and wealth. He was possibly responsible for seeing that the writings (the Gospel of Luke and book of Acts) were copied and distributed. The Gospel of Luke was also intended to deepen Theophilus faith and to replace ill-founded reports about Jesus.
路加福音是四本福音书中最长的一本，同使徒行传契合成为一本两卷的著作。这两本书都是写给提阿非罗。提阿非罗这个名字有“爱神之人”的意思。提阿非罗被认为是罗马长官或至少是居于高位富有的一个人。他可能负责监管出版物（路加福音和使徒行传）的复制和分发。同时路加福音也是为了坚固深化提阿非罗的信心以及取代那些对耶稣的恶意报道。
Luke's account of Jesus ministry can be divided into three major parts: (1) the events that occurred in and around Galilee (4:14-9:50), (2) those that took place in Judea and Perea (9:51-19:27) and (3) those of the final week in Jerusalem (19:28-24:53).
路加对耶稣事工的叙述可以分为三大部分：1. 发生在加利利附近的事件（4：14-9：50）。2. 发生在犹大和利比亚的事件（9：51-19：27）。3.最后一个星期在耶路撒冷所发生的事件（19：28-24：53）。
Luke had Gentile Christians in mind when he wrote the book is evident from the fact that he does not emphasize the Messianic character of Jesus as Matthew does, but that he emphasizes the fact that Jesus is the Savior of the whole world. Luke takes the genealogy back to Adam to show that Christ is not only for the Jews, but for all people in all the world. Luke explains to his readers Semitic names and terms and speaks of Jewish customs.
路加不像马太那样强调耶稣就是弥赛亚，而是着重于耶稣是整个世界的救主，从这一点可以看出路加在写这本书时，他头脑里想的是外邦信徒（非犹太人的基督徒）。路加将耶稣的家谱追溯到亚当，从而表明了基督不只是为犹太人，也是为了世上所有人而来的。路加向他的读者解释闪米特人的人名和术语并且讲到了犹太习俗。
History历史背景:
The Romans took control of Palestine in 63 B.C. and made Herod the Great king of Judea. Herod the Great reigned 37-4 B.C. and his kingdom included Judea, Samaria, Galilee, much of Perea and Coele-Syria. He was a non-Jew and brutal. He murdered his wife, three sons, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle and many others. Herod was a 'client' king, ruling on behalf of the Romans who had invaded in 63 BCE. He began the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple, one of the 'Wonders of the Ancient World' to win over the Jews. Herod the Great was the ruler when Jesus was born.
罗马帝国在公元前63年接管巴勒斯坦，并任命大希律为犹大的王。大希律执政于公元前37年到4年，他的领地包括了犹大，撒玛利亚，加利利，以及利比亚和科艾勒-叙利亚的大部分。他不是犹太人，为人凶残。他杀害了他的妻子，三个儿子，岳母，妻子的兄弟，叔叔和许多其他人。希律是一个“藩属王”，代表公元前63年入侵的罗马帝国在治理这地。他开始了对耶路撒冷圣殿（古代世界的奇迹之一）的重建，以此来笼络犹太人。在耶稣出世时，大希律是执政者。



Luke 1:1-80路加福音1：1-80
            Luke begins with a formal introduction in which he states his purpose for writing and identifies the recipient. He acknowledges other reports on the subject, shows the need for this new work and states his method of approach and sources of information.
路加以一个正式的引言开始路加福音来陈述他写作的目的和读者对象。同时他也提到了对这一主题的其他报道，表达了这件新作品的必要性，陈述了他的写作方法和信息来源。

Introduction 引言
1Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, What things have beenfulfilled? 2just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. What are some things that you would do to carefully investigate a person or a story?
1:1提阿非罗大人哪，有好些人提笔作书，述说在我们中间所成就的事，成就了什么事？1:2是照传道的人，从起初亲眼看见，又传给我们的。1:3这些事我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，1:4使你知道所学之道都是确实的。为了仔细研究考察一个人或一件事，你会怎么做呢？

The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold预告施洗约翰降生
5In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. 6Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly. What does it mean to be blameless? 7But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years. Name a disappointment or hurt you have experienced.
1:5当犹太王希律的时候，亚比雅班里有一个祭司，名叫撒迦利亚。他妻子是亚伦的后人，名叫以利沙伯。1:6他们二人，在神面前都是义人，遵行主的一切诫命礼仪，没有可指摘的。无可指摘指的是什么意思？1:7只是没有孩子，因为以利沙伯不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。请举出你所经历过的一次令你失望或是痛苦的事。

8Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 9he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 10And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
1:8撒迦利亚按班次，在神面前供祭司的职分， 1:9照祭司的规矩掣签，得进主殿烧香。 1:10烧香的时候，众百姓在外面祷告。
11Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. Why would Zechariah be gripped with fear? 13But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. 14He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 15for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. 16Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. 17And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." How did the angel describe John?
1:11有主的使者站在香坛的右边，向他显现。 1:12撒迦利亚看见，就惊慌害怕。撒迦利亚为什么惊慌害怕？ 1:13天使对他说，撒迦利亚，不要害怕。因为你的祈祷已经被听见了，你的妻子以利沙伯要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。 1:14你必欢喜快乐，有许多人因他出世，也必喜乐。 1:15他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。 1:16他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的神。 1:17他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧。又为主预备合用的百姓。天使如何描述约翰的？
18Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years." What was Zechariah really saying?
1:18撒迦利亚对天使说，我凭着什么可知道这事呢？我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。撒迦利亚话里真正的含义是什么？
19The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. 20And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time." Describe Gabriel.
1:19天使回答说，我是站在神面前的加百列，奉差而来，对你说话，将这好信息报给你。 1:20到了时候，这话必然应验。只因你不信，你必哑吧不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。请描述一下加百列。
21Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. 22When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. What happened?
1:21百姓等候撒迦利亚，诧异他许久在殿里。 1:22及至他出来，不能和他们说话。他们就知道他在殿里见了异象。因为他直向他们打手式，竟成了哑吧。发生了什么事？
23When his time of service was completed, he returned home. 24After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. 25"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people." What had the Lord done for Elizabeth?
1:23他供职的日子已满，就回家去了。 1:24这些日子以后，他的妻子以利沙伯怀了孕，就隐藏了五个月， 1:25说，主在眷顾我的日子，这样看待我，要把我在人间的羞耻除掉。神为以利沙伯做了什么？

The Birth of Jesus Foretold 预言耶稣降生
26In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, What does "in the sixth month" refer to? 27to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. How is a "betrothal" different than an "engagement"? 28The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."    29Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 30But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. What similar announcement did Mary receive? 31You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. 32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end." What "good news" does the angel Gabriel announce to Mary?
1:26到了第六个月，天使加百列奉神的差遣，往加利利的一座城去，这城名叫拿撒勒。第六个月是相对什么而说的？ 1:27到一个童女那里，是已经许配大卫家的一个人，名叫约瑟，童女的名字叫马利亚。古时的订婚（婚约）和现代的订婚有什么不同？ 1:28天使进去，对她说，蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了。 1:29马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。 1:30天使对她说，马利亚不要怕。你在神面前已经蒙恩了。马利亚听到了什么类似的预言？ 1:31你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。 1:32他要为大，称为至高者的儿子。主神要把他祖大卫的位给他。 1:33他要作雅各家的王，直到永远。他的国也没有穷尽。天使加百利向马利亚宣告了什么“好消息”？

34"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"
1:34马利亚对天使说，我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？
35The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. What do we learn about Mary's child? 36Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. 37For nothing is impossible with God."
1:35天使回答说，圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你。因此所要生的圣者，必称为神的儿子。（或作所要生的必称为圣称为神的儿子）关于马利亚的孩子我们都了解到了什么？1:36况且你的亲戚以利沙伯，在年老的时候，也怀了男胎。就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。 1:37因为出于神的话，没有一句不带能力的。
38"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her. How does Mary describe herself? What does it mean to be a servant?
1:38马利亚说，我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。天使就离开她去了。马利亚如何称呼自己？成为一个使女意味着什么？

Mary Visits Elizabeth 马利亚往见以利沙伯
39At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, 40where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. 41When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! What does Elizabeth proclaim? 43But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 44As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 45Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!" Who is Elizabeth calling blessed and why?
1:39那时候马利亚起身，急忙往山地里去，来到犹大的一座城。 1:40进了撒迦利亚的家，问以利沙伯安。 1:41以利沙伯一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动，以利沙伯且被圣灵充满。 1:42高声喊着说，你在妇女中是有福的，你所怀的胎也是有福的。以利沙伯在宣告什么？ 1:43我主的母到我这里来，这是从哪里得的呢？ 1:44因为你问安的声音，一入我耳，我腹里的胎，就欢喜跳动。 1:45这相信的女子是有福的。因为主对她所说的话，都要应验。以利沙伯称谁为有福的？为什么？

Mary's Song 马利亚的诗歌
    46And Mary said:
   "My soul glorifies the Lord
       47and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
    48for he has been mindful
      of the humble state of his servant.
   From now on all generations will call me blessed,
       49for the Mighty One has done great things for me—
      holy is his name.
    50His mercy extends to those who fear him,
      from generation to generation.
    51He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;
      he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
    52He has brought down rulers from their thrones
      but has lifted up the humble.
    53He has filled the hungry with good things
      but has sent the rich away empty.
    54He has helped his servant Israel,
      remembering to be merciful
    55to Abraham and his descendants forever,
      even as he said to our fathers."
1:46马利亚说，我心尊主为大，
1:47我灵以神我的救主为乐。
1:48因为他顾念他使女的卑微。从今以后，万代要称我有福。
1:49那有权能的为我成就了大事。他的名为圣。
1:50他怜悯敬畏他的人，直到世世代代。
1:51他用膀臂施展大能。那狂傲的人，正心里妄想，就被他赶散了。
1:52他叫有权柄的失位，叫卑贱的升高。
1:53叫饥饿的得饱美食，叫富足的空手回去。
1:54他扶助了他的仆人以色列，
1:55为要记念亚伯拉罕和他的后裔，施怜悯，直到永远，正如从前对我们列祖所说的话。
Mary's song of praise has four different parts. What is the basic theme in verses
46-48?
49-50?
51-53?
54-55?
马利亚的诗歌有四个不同的部分。以下经文中的基调分别是什么？
46-47？48-50？51-53？54-55？
    56Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. What did Mary probably witness before she returned home?
1:56马利亚和以利沙伯同住，约有三个月，就回家去了。
马利亚在回家之前很可能见证了什么事情？

The Birth of John the Baptist施洗约翰出生
57When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. 58Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
1:57以利沙伯的产期到了，就生了一个儿子。 1:58邻里亲族，听见主向他大施怜悯，就和他一同欢乐。
    59On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, 60but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John." What did Elizabeth believe?
   1:59到了第八日，他们来要给孩子行割礼。并要照他父亲的名字，叫他撒迦利亚。 1:60他母亲说，不可。要叫他约翰。以利沙伯信了什么？
61They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
    62Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 63He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John." 64Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God. What was the first thing Zechariah did when he could speak? 65The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. 66Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him. What was noticed about John?
1:61他们说，你亲族中没有叫这名字的。 1:62他们就向他父亲打手式，问他要叫这孩子什么名字。 1:63他要了一块写字的板，就写上说，他的名字是约翰。他们便都希奇。 1:64撒迦利亚的口立时开了，舌头也舒展了，就说出话来，称颂神。当撒迦利亚可以开口说话时，他做的第一件事是什么？ 1:65周围居住的人都惧怕，这一切的事就传遍了犹太的山地。 1:66凡听见的人，都将这事放在心里，说，这个孩子，将来怎么样呢？因为有主与他同在。约翰有什么特别之处？

Zechariah's Song 撒迦利亚的诗歌
67His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
    68"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
      because he has come and has redeemed his people.
    69He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
      in the house of his servant David
1:67他父亲撒迦利亚，被圣灵充满了，就预言说，
1:68主以色列的神，是应当称颂的。因他眷顾他的百姓，为他们施行救赎。
1:69在他仆人大卫家中，为我们兴起了拯救的角，
   For what does Zechariah praise God?撒迦利亚为什么而赞美神？
 70(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
    71salvation from our enemies
      and from the hand of all who hate us—
    72to show mercy to our fathers
      and to remember his holy covenant,
    73the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
1:70（正如主借着从创世以来，圣先知的口所说的话）
1:71拯救我们脱离仇敌，和一切恨我们之人的手。
1:72向我们列祖施怜悯，记念他的圣约。
1:73就是他对我们祖宗亚伯拉罕所起的誓，
      Who is Abraham?亚伯拉罕是谁？
    74to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,
      and to enable us to serve him without fear
    75in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
    76And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
1:74叫我们既从仇敌手中被救出来，
1:75就可以终身在他面前，坦然无惧地用圣洁公义事奉他。
1:76孩子阿，你要称为至高者的先知。
  What will John be called?约翰要被称为什么？
      for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
因为你要行在主的前面，预备他的道路。
   77to give his people the knowledge of salvation
      through the forgiveness of their sins,
1:77叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知道救恩。
    What does Zechariah say about his son's mission in live?撒迦利亚对于他儿子在世的事工说了什么？
   78because of the tender mercy of our God,
      by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
    79to shine on those living in darkness
      and in the shadow of death,
   to guide our feet into the path of peace."
80And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.
1:78因我们神怜悯的心肠，叫清晨的日光从高天临到我们，
1:79要照亮坐在黑暗中死荫里的人。把我们的脚引到平安的路上。
1:80那孩子渐渐长大，心灵强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。
        What does it mean that the child grew? and become strong in spirit?孩子渐渐长大指的是什么？心灵强健指的是什么？
