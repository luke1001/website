路加福音 Luke 12:1-59
            While the assaults of the Pharisees and scribes were going on, they were attempting everything in their power to discredit Jesus and find some ground for accusing Him, the people came together to Him in greater multitudes than ever before, by the thousands. Jesus is speaking to His disciples, but the people were able to hear what Jesus said.
法利赛人和文士在重伤耶稣的同时，他们还想尽一切办法来败坏耶稣的名声，寻找控告耶稣的机会，即使这样，来寻求耶稣的人还是有成千上万，甚至比以前更多。耶稣在对门徒讲道，但这些来寻求耶稣的人也能听到祂所讲的。

Warnings and Encouragements告诫与勉励
 1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. What does yeast do? [A hypocrite is someone who pretends to be good, without really being so.] Where do you think hypocrisy begins? Why is hypocrisy called yeast? 2 There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What will happen to those who are hypocrites?  3 What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. Who knows your thoughts?
12:1这时，有几万人聚集，甚至彼此践踏，耶稣开讲，先对门徒说，你们要防备法利赛人的酵，就是假冒为善。酵是做什么用的？你认为假冒为善起于何处？为什么称假冒为善为酵？
12:2掩盖的事，没有不露出来的。隐藏的事，没有不被人知道的。会有什么发生在假冒为善的人身上？
12:3因此你们在暗中所说的，将要在明处被人听见。在内室附耳所说的，将要在房上被人宣扬。谁知道你的所思所想？
   4 “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. What does Jesus call His disciples? Whom should they not fear? 5 But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. Who can throw you into hell? 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Are sparrows highly valued by men? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. How much care does God give them? 7 Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. What does it mean to be worth more than sparrows?
12:4我的朋友，我对你们说，那杀身体以后，不能再作什么的，不要怕他们。耶稣如何称呼祂的门徒？他们不应该怕谁？
12:5我要指示你们当怕的是谁。当怕那杀了以后，又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们，正要怕他。谁能把你丢在地狱？
12:6五个麻雀，不是卖二分银子吗？但在神面前，一个也不忘记。麻雀是不是被人看为贵的东西？神给麻雀什么样的关注？
12:7就是你们的头发也都被数过了。不要惧怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重。比麻雀还要贵重指的是什么意思？
   8 “I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. What happens to a person who acknowledges Jesus to others? 9 But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God. When would a person be disowned before the angels of God? 10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
12:8我又告诉你们，凡在人面前认我的，人子在神的使者面前也必认他。认耶稣的人会怎么样？
12:9在人面前不认我的，人子在神的使者面前也必不认他。什么人会在神的使者面前被丢弃？
12:10凡说话干犯人子的，还可得赦免，惟独亵渎圣灵的，总不得赦免。
   11 “When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.” Why should the disciples not be afraid when they are brought before unbelievers?
12:11人带你们到会堂，并官府，和有权柄的人面前，不要思虑怎么分诉，说什么话。
12:12 因为正在那时候，圣灵要指教你们当说的话。当门徒被带到不信的人面前，他们为什么不应该害怕？

Notes注释
Blasphemes against the Holy Spirit - Showing disrespect against God. The Holy Spirit is responsible for our belief in Jesus. A person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has no faith and has shut out the possibility of believing because they have nothing but hatred.
亵渎圣灵 ---对神不敬。圣灵保守我们在耶稣基督里的信心。一个亵渎圣灵的人是没有信心的，而且也不可能会信因为他们除了仇恨什么也没有。

The Parable of the Rich Fool无知财主的比喻
            A man wanted Jesus to act as a judge in a legal matter. The Jewish rabbis were often asked to act as judges in legal disputes. Jesus was the rabbi of Nazareth. So the man figured that Jesus would settle the dispute. Pay close attention to what Jesus tells the man.
有一个人想要请耶稣做断事的官。犹太的拉比常被请为断事的官。耶稣是拿撒勒的拉比。所以这个人认为耶稣会来解决纷争。请注意耶稣对这个人说了什么。
 13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” What is being asked of Jesus?

 14 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?” Does Jesus think this is His job? Who is responsible in this earthly matter? 15 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.” What are we to be on our guard against? What is greed?
16 And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. How did the man gain his wealth? 17 He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’ What can we learn from the man's thoughts?
   18 “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’ How would you describe the man's plan? What was missing?
   20 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! Describe a fool. This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ What was the point of this parable?
   21 “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.” How can we be rich toward God?
12:13    众人中有一个人对耶稣说，夫子，请你吩咐我的兄长和我分开家业。这个人对耶稣有什么请求？ 12:14    耶稣说，你这个人，谁立我作你们断事的官，给你们分家业呢？耶稣认为这是祂的工作吗？谁才是要为这种世上的事担当责任？12:15    于是对众人说，你们要谨慎自守，免去一切的贪心。因为人的生命，不在乎家道丰富。我们要为什么而谨慎自守？什么是贪心？
12:16    就用比喻对他们说，有一个财主，田产丰盛。这个人是如何赚得他的财富的？ 12:17    自己心里思想说，我的出产没有地方收藏，怎么办呢？透过这个人的思想上我们可以知道什么？ 12:18    又说，我要这么办。要把我的仓房拆了，另盖更大的。在那里好收藏我一切的粮食和财物。 12:19    然后要对我的灵魂说，灵魂哪，你有许多财物积存，可作多年的费用。只管安安逸逸的吃喝快乐吧。你认为这个人的计划怎么样？缺少什么吗？
12:20    神却对他说，无知的人哪，今夜必要你的灵魂。你所预备的，要归谁呢？这个比喻是要说明什么？12:21    凡为自己积财，在神面前却不富足的，也是这样。我们如何在神面前成为富足？


Notes注释
Divide the inheritance – The general rule that an elder son received double a younger one’s portion. Disputes over such matters were normally settled by rabbis. This man’s request of Jesus was selfish and materialistic. There is no indication that the man had been listening seriously to what Jesus had been saying in the previous verses. Jesus replied with a parable about the consequences of greed.
分开家业---- 一般来说，长子要比小儿子多的一份家业。在这种事情上的争议一般是由拉比来平息的。这个人在这里对耶稣的要求是自私的。在前面的经文里，没有任何显示来说明这个人在认真地听耶稣讲话。耶稣用一个与贪婪有关的比喻来回答这个人的要求。
Who appointed me a judge – Jesus was not the least bit interested. He is neither a judge, to decide the case on its merits, nor is He an arbiter, to carry out any decision which He might be inclined to make.
谁立我作你们断事的官----耶稣对作断事的官一点兴趣也没有。他既不是断事的官，来审判事务，也不是决断者，来对事情做出决定。

Parable – Parables are a comparison or an illustration. They are usually stories out of ordinary life used to illustrate spiritual or moral truths; they had a single main point. Parables were particularly effective and easy to remember because he used familiar scenes. Although parables clarified Jesus’ teaching, they also included hidden meanings needing further explanation. These hidden meanings challenged the sincerely interested to further inquiry, and taught truths that
Jesus wanted to conceal from unbelievers. From parables Jesus’ enemies could find no direct statements to use against him. This does not express a desire that some would not understand, but simply states the sad truth that those who are not willing to receive Jesus’ message will find the truth hidden from them.
比喻----  比喻是一种比较或是例释。它们一般是从生活中来的故事，被用来解释灵上的或精神上的真理；它们是指出（说明）一个主要观点。因为耶稣都是用大家熟悉的东西来作比喻，所以这些比喻特别有效，也特别容易记忆。经管比喻把耶稣的教导都清楚地表达出来，但比喻也会含有一些潜在的寓意需要进一步的解释。这些隐藏的寓意引发了那些真正感兴趣的人对耶稣教导的进一步的寻求，同时这些隐藏的寓意所要教授的真理是耶稣要向不信的人隐蔽的。从比喻中，耶稣的敌人就不能找到直接的证据来攻击他。这并不是说这些比喻是故意不要人理解的，只是表明了一个悲哀的事实，就是那些不愿意接受耶稣教导的人是不能从比喻中找到所隐藏的真理。


Eat, drink and be merry – This was not for the purpose of doing the work of good stewardship, gut to have the enjoyment of all the riches for himself. His goods were his god; in them he trusted to bring him happiness and the fulfillment of his desires.
安安逸逸的吃喝快乐---- 这并不是为了好的理财（为将来做好打算），只是为了自己能享受着所有的财富。他的财富就是他的神；他相信财富能给他带来快乐，也能满足他所有的欲望。

Do Not Worry不要忧虑
 22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. What is Jesus asking His disciples? 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. What is life about? 24 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! What does Jesus remind His disciples? 25 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? How much does worrying add to your life? 26 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?
   27 “Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. What can you tell me about Solomon? How well was Solomon dressed in comparison to the wild flowers? 28 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—How will we be clothed? you of little faith! Explain what it means to have little faith. 29 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. What are we to seek after? Why?
   32 “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Are we to sell all our possessions? Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. What is usually kept in a purse? 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. What will your heart follow?
12:22    耶稣又对门徒说，所以我告诉你们，不要为生命忧虑吃什么。为身体忧虑穿什么。 耶稣要门徒如何行？12:23    因为生命胜于饮食，身体胜于衣裳。生命是为了什么？ 12:24    你想乌鸦，也不种，也不收。又没有仓，又没有库，神尚且养活它。你们比飞鸟是何等的贵重呢。耶稣在提醒门徒什么？ 12:25    你们哪一个能用思虑，使寿数多加一刻呢？（或作使身量多加一肘呢？） 思虑能在你的寿数上添加多少？12:26    这最小的事，你们尚且不能作，为什么还忧虑其余的事呢？
12:27    你想，百合花怎么长起来。它也不劳苦，也不纺线。然而我告诉你们，就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的，还不如这花一朵呢。关于所罗门，你能告诉我什么？与花相比，所罗门穿得怎么样？ 12:28    你们这小信的人哪，野地里的草，今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，神还给它这样的妆饰，何况你们呢。我们要得到什么样的妆饰？请解释什么是小信？ 12:29    你们不要求吃什么，喝什么，也不要挂心。 12:30    这都是外邦人所求的，你们必须用这些东西，你们的父是知道的。 12:31    你们只要求他的国，这些东西就必加给你们了。我们要寻求什么？为什么？
 12:32    你们这小群，不要惧怕，因为你们的父，乐意把国赐给你们。12:33你们要变卖所有的，周济人。为自己预备永不坏的钱囊，用不尽的财宝在天上，就是贼不能近，虫不能蛀的地方。是要我们变卖所有的家产吗？钱囊里面一般放的是什么？12:34因为你们的财宝在哪里，你们的心也在哪里。你的心会跟随什么？

Watchfulness
            Before Jesus returned to heaven, he wanted His disciples to be prepared for when He would return a second time. Their readiness is a spiritual one.
耶稣在被接回天上之前，祂要门徒为祂再来做预备。他们在灵里做好预备。
35 “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, 36 like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. What did Jesus ask of the disciples? 37 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Who do you think is the master? Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. When will the disciples be served by Jesus? 38 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. Why might it be difficult for the servants to be ready if the master comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak? 39 But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. 40 You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.” When will Jesus return?
12:35你们腰里要束上带，灯也要点着。12:36自己好像仆人等候主人，从婚姻的筵席上回来。他来到叩门，就立刻给他开门。耶稣对门徒有什么要求？12:37主人来了，看见仆人儆醒，那仆人就有福了。我实在告诉你们，主人必叫他们坐席，自己束上带，进前伺候他们。你认为主人是谁？什么时候耶稣要来伺候门徒？12:38或是二更天来，或是三更天来，看见仆人这样，那仆人就有福了。如果主人半夜或是黎明前来，为什么仆人可能会很难做好准备？12:39家主若知道贼什么时候来，就必儆醒，不容贼挖透房屋，这是你们所知道的。12:40你们也要预备。因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。耶稣什么时候再来？
 41 Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?” What was Peter really asking? (hint: think of the faithful servants reward.)
 42 The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? What are the responsibilities of the servant? 43 It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. 44 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. What will happen to this servant? 45 But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk. How does this servant in charge behave? 46 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. What will happen to this servant?
12:41彼得说，主阿，这比喻是为我们说的呢？还是为众人呢？彼得实际上是在问什么？（提示：回想一下忠心的仆人所得到的奖赏）
12:42主说，谁是那忠心有见识的管家，主人派他管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？管家的责任是什么？12:43主人来到，看见仆人这样行，那仆人就有福了。12:44我实在告诉你们，主人要派他管理一切所有的。仆人发生了什么事？12:45那仆人若心里说，我的主人必来得迟。就动手打仆人和使女，并且吃喝醉酒。这个负责的仆人有什么样的行为？12:46在他想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，重重地处治他（或作把他腰斩了），定他和不忠心的人同罪。这人仆人发生了什么事？
   47 “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. 48 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. What can we learn from this parable?
12:47仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备，又不顺他的意思行，那仆人必多受责打。12:48惟有那不知道的，作了当受责打的事，必少受责打因为多给谁，就向谁多取。多托谁，就向谁多要。从这个比喻中我们可以学到什么？

Not Peace but Division
    49 “I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! What has not yet started. What is the fire? 50 But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed! What is Jesus final baptism? 51 Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. 52 From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” Why will families be divided?
12:49我来要把火丢在地上。倘若已经着起来，不也是我所愿意的吗？什么还没有开始？火是什么？12:50我有当受的洗。还没有成就，我是何等的迫切呢。耶稣最后要受的洗是什么？12:51你们以为我来，是叫地上太平吗？我告诉你们，不是，乃是叫人分争。12:52从今以后，一家五个人将要分争，三个人和两个人相争，两个人和三个人相争。12:53父亲和儿子相争，儿子和父亲相争。母亲和女儿相争，女儿和母亲相争。婆婆和媳妇相争，媳妇和婆婆相争。家人之间为什么会有相争？

Interpreting the Times
 54 He said to the crowd: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does. 55 And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is. 56 Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time? What should the people understand but fail to see?
   57 “Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right? 58 As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. 59 I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.” What spiritual advice does Jesus give to people who face the impending judgment of God?
12:54耶稣又对众人说，你们看见西边起了云彩，就说，要下一阵雨。果然就有。12:55起了南风，就说，将要燥热。也就有了。12:56假冒为善的人哪，你们知道分辨天地的气色。怎么不知道分辨这时候呢？众人本应该看到什么却没有看到？12:57你们又为何不自己审量，什么是合理的呢？12:58你同告你的对头去见官，还在路上，务要尽力的和他了结。恐怕他拉你到官面前，官交付差役，差役把你下在监里12:59我告诉你，若有半文钱没有还清，你断不能从那里出来。对于要面临将要来的神的审判的人，耶稣给了他们什么属灵的忠告？

Notes注释
Verses 54-56: Wind from the west was from the Mediterranean Sea; from the south it was from the desert. Although people could use such indicators to forecast the weather, they could not recognize the signs of spiritual crisis, the coming of the Messiah, the threat of his death, the coming confrontation with Rome, and the eternal consequences these events would have for their own lives.
54---56节：西风是从地中海吹过来的；南风是从沙漠来的。尽管人们可以以此来预测天气，但他们却不能分辨属灵危机的意象，弥赛亚的来临，祂死亡的迫近，将临到的与罗马的对抗，或是这些事件给他们的生命所带来的最终结局。
