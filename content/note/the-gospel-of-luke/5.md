路加福音 Luke 6:1-49

Lord of the Sabbath 安息日的主

 1One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grain fields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. Why would the disciples pick and eat the grain? 2Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?" What objection do the Pharisees raise?
 3Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions." 5Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." What does Jesus response to the charge of Sabbath-breaking teach us about God's will and the authority of Jesus
 6On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. 7The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. What did the Pharisees apparently believe about the powers of Jesus? As Jesus healed others, what happened to the Pharisees authority? 8But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there. Why is the man standing in front of everyone? 9Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" What is Jesus trying to get the Pharisees to realize? What was the intent of the Pharisees? 10He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored. 11But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. Why would they be furious at the healing? What does the Pharisees' and teachers' of the law great anger against Jesus reveal about them?
6:1有一个安息日，耶稣从麦地经过。他的门徒掐了麦穗，用手搓着吃。门徒为什么掐麦穗吃？6:2有几个法利赛人说，你们为什么作安息日不可作的事呢？法利赛人提出了什么异议？6:3耶稣对他们说，经上记着大卫和跟从他的人，饥饿之时所作的事，连这个你们也没有念过吗？6:4他怎么进了神的殿，拿陈设饼吃，又给跟从的人吃。这饼除了祭司以外，别人都不可吃。6:5又对他们说，人子是安息日的主。对祂违反安息日的指控，耶稣所作出的回应给了我们对于神旨意和耶稣权柄的什么教导？6:6又有一个安息日，耶稣进了会堂教训人。在那里有一个人右手枯干了。6:7文士和法利赛人窥探耶稣，在安息日治病不治病。要得把柄去告他。显然法利赛人相信耶稣的能力是什么样的？当耶稣在安息日医治人，法利赛人的权威将会怎么样？6:8耶稣却知道他们的意念。就对那枯干一只手的人说，起来，站在当中。那人就起来站着。这个人为什么站在大家的面前？6:9耶稣对他们说，我问你们，在安息日行善行恶，救命害命，那样是可以的呢？耶稣想要让法利赛人认识到什么？法利赛人的企图是什么？6:10他就周围看着他们众人，对那人说，伸出手来。他把手一伸，手就复了原。6:11他们就满心大怒，彼此商议，怎样处治耶稣。他们为什么会因医治而满心大怒呢？从法利赛人和文士对耶稣的极大愤怒中，可以看出他们是什么样的人？

Notes注释
Pick some heads of grain - There was nothing wrong in the action itself.
掐了麦穗——这个行为本身并没有什么错。
Unlawful on the Sabbath - According to Jewish tradition, harvesting was
forbidden on the Sabbath. Jewish tradition had so multiplied the requirements and restrictions for keeping the Sabbath that the burden had become intolerable. Jesus wanted emphasize the purpose of the Sabbath - a day intended for spiritual, mental, and physical restoration.
安息日不可作的事--- 根据犹太传统，在安息日是不能收割的。犹太传统已将守安息日的规矩繁琐化，以至于成为难担负的重担。耶稣想要强调安息日的意义 ---- 在灵里，精神上和肉体上的作休整的一天。
What David did - The relationship between the Old Testament incident and the infringement of the Sabbath by the disciples lies in the fact that on both occasions godly men did something forbidden.
大卫所做的 ----这个旧约里的事件和门徒们对安息日规矩的违反，这两者的相关性在于两次事件中属神的人都做了不可以做的事。


The Twelve Apostles 十二门徒
 12One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. How had Jesus spent the night? 13When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: 14Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 15Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 16Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
6:12那时耶稣出去上山祷告。整夜祷告神。耶稣是如何度过这个夜晚的？6:13到了天亮，叫他的门徒来。就从他们中间挑选十二个人，称他们为使徒。6:14这十二个人有西门，耶稣又给他起名叫彼得，还有他兄弟安得烈，又有雅各和约翰，腓力和巴多罗买，6:15马太和多马，亚勒腓的儿子雅各，和奋锐党的西门，6:16雅各的儿子犹大，（儿子或作兄弟）和卖主的加略人犹大。

Notes注释

Blessings and Woes福与祸
 17He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon, 18who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Why had the people gathered? Look on the map from lesson 1. Where did the people come from? Those troubled by evil spirits were cured, 19and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all. What happened when the people touched him?
6:17耶稣和他们下了山，站在一块平地上。同站的有许多门徒，又有许多百姓，从犹太全地，和耶路撒冷，并推罗西顿的海边来。都要听他讲道，又指望医治他们的病。6:18还有被污鬼缠磨的，也得了医治。人们为什么聚集了起来？请查看第一节课笔记里的地图。这些人是从哪里而来？6:19众人都想要摸他。因为有能力从他身上发出来，医好了他们。当人们摸到祂的时候，发生了什么事情？
 20Looking at his disciples, he said: Who was Jesus specifically teaching? Who else was present?
   "Blessed are you who are poor,  What does Jesus mean by "you who are poor?"  for yours is the kingdom of God.
 21Blessed are you who hunger now, What is meant by "you who hunger?"
      for you will be satisfied.
   Blessed are you who weep now, What is meant by "you who weep?"
      for you will laugh.
 22Blessed are you when men hate you,
      when they exclude you and insult you
      and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man. What does Jesus mean by being blessed when men hate you,...?
 23"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.
6:20耶稣举目看着门徒说，耶稣是在特别教导谁？当时还有什么别的人在场？你们贫穷的人有福了。耶稣说的“贫穷的人”指的是什么人？因为神的国是你们的。
6:21你们饥饿的人有福了。“饥饿的人”指的是什么人？因为你们将要饱足。你们哀哭的人有福了。“哀哭的人”指的是什么人？因为你们将要喜笑。
6:22人为人子恨恶你们，拒绝你们，辱骂你们，弃掉你们的名，以为是恶，你们就有福了。耶稣说当人恨恶你们，你们就有福了，这指的是什么意思？
6:23当那日你们要欢喜跳跃。因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。他们的祖宗待先知也是这样。
24"But woe to you who are rich, What is wrong with being rich?
      for you have already received your comfort.
 25Woe to you who are well fed now,
      for you will go hungry. What is wrong with being well fed?
   Woe to you who laugh now,
      for you will mourn and weep. What is wrong with laughing
 26Woe to you when all men speak well of you,
      for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets. What is wrong with having men speak well of you? Why does Jesus explain to His disciples the characteristics of those who are under God's judgment in verses 24-26?
6:24但你们富足的人有祸了。富足有什么错？因为你们受过你们的安慰。
6:25你们饱足的人有祸了。因为你们将要饥饿。饱足有什么错？你们喜笑的人有祸了。因为你们将要哀恸哭泣。喜笑有什么错？
6:26人都说你们好的时候，你们就有祸了。因为他们的祖宗待假先知也是这样。被人称为好有什么错？耶稣为什么要向门徒们解释在24-26节中那些要受神审判的人的特征？

Notes注释
A level place - probably a plateau
平地 ---可能是一个平原

Love for Enemies 爱仇敌
Look at each of the following verses.查看以下每节经文
 27"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. What strong commands did Jesus give His followers? 29If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. List three examples of demonstrating this love that Jesus gives in verses 29-30. Agree of Disagree? In verses 29-30, Jesus is teaching His followers not to resist aggression under any circumstances. 30Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31Do to others as you would have them do to you. What principle of love does Jesus teach in verse 31? How is this teaching different from "Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you?"
6:27只是我告诉你们这听道的人，你们的仇敌要爱他，恨你们的要待他好。6:28咒诅你们的要为他祝福，凌辱你们的要为他祷告。耶稣给了祂的跟随者什么大诫命？6:29有人打你这边的脸，连那边的脸也由他打。有人夺你的外衣，连里衣也由他拿去。请列出在29-30节中耶稣给出的体现这样的爱的例子。在29-30节，耶稣是在教导祂的跟随者在任何情况下都不要抗拒侵犯的行为。你同意不同意这样的解释？6:30凡求你的，就给他。有人夺你的东西去，不用再要回来。6:31你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人。在31节中耶稣给了什么爱的准则？这个教导与“己所不欲勿施于人”有什么不同？

 32"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. 33And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. 34And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. 35But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. What point is Jesus' making about the quality of the love He wants His believers to have in verses 32-35a? Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. What is our blessing? Where do Christ's people find the ability to be merciful?
6:32你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也爱那爱他们的人。6:33你们若善待那善待你们的人，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也是这样行。6:34你们若借给人，指望从他收回，有什么可酬谢的呢？就是罪人也借给罪人，要如数收回。6:35你们倒要爱仇敌，也要善待他们，并要借给人不指望偿还。在32-35节中，关于祂想要祂的信徒们持有的爱的品质，耶稣要说明什么？你们的赏赐就必大了，你们也必作至高者的儿子。因为他恩待那忘恩的和作恶的。6:36你们要慈悲，象你们的父慈悲一样。我们得到的祝福是什么？基督的子民从哪里可以得到对人慈悲的能力？

Judging Others论断人
 37"Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. What attitudes is Jesus forbidding and expecting in verse 37? 38Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." What encouragement does Jesus give about generous giving in verse 38? Is Jesus promising us that generous people will be materially rich?
6:37你们不要论断人，就不被论断。你们不要定人的罪，就不被定罪。你们要饶恕人，就必蒙饶恕。（饶恕原文作释放）在37节中，耶稣不允许什么样行为，期盼什么样行为？6:38你们要给人，就必有给你们的。并且用十足的升斗，连摇带按，上尖下流的，倒在你们怀里。因为你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们。在38节中对于慷慨的施舍耶稣给出了什么鼓励？耶稣是不是告诉我们慷慨的人就会物质上富足？
 39He also told them this parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? 40A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. What important point does Jesus make about leading and teaching people properly?
 41"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 42How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. What humorous point does Jesus make against hypocrisy?
6:39耶稣又用比喻对他们说，瞎子岂能领瞎子，两个人不是都要掉在坑里吗？6:40学生不能高过先生。凡学成了的不过和先生一样。对于正确地教导引领人，耶稣给出了什么重要的观点？6:41为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？6:42你不见自己眼中有梁木。怎能对你弟兄说，容我去掉你眼中的刺呢？你这假冒为善的人，先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。耶稣给出了什么诙谐的见解来批评假冒伪善的人？

Notes注释
Poured into your lap - Probably refers to thye way the outer garment was worn, leaving a fold over the belt that could be used as a large pocket to hold a measure of wheat.
倒在你们怀里 --- 可能指着穿外衣的方式说的，在腰带上留出一折可作为一个大口袋来装麦子。

Parable - Usually stories out of ordinary life used to illustrate spiritual or moral truth. (An earthly story with a heavenly meaning.) Ordinarily they had a single main point.
比喻 ---出自平常生活的故事来揭示灵里的或是道德上的真理。（赋予属天意义的世间故事）。一般一个比喻有一个主要观点。

A Tree and Its Fruit树与果子
 43"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. 44Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. 45The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. What important truth does Jesus express about bearing fruit in vs. 43-45?
6:43因为没有好树结坏果子。也没有坏树结好果子。6:44凡树木看果子，就可以认出他来。人不是从荆棘上摘无花果，也不是从蒺藜里摘葡萄。6:45善人从他心里所存的善，就发出善来。恶人从他心里所存的恶，就发出恶来。因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。在43-45节中关于结果子耶稣要表达什么重要的真理？

The Wise and Foolish Builders智慧与愚昧的建造者
 46"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? 47I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. 48He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. 49But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete." Like the men in the parable we are builders. We are building our lives. What life-building lessons can we gain from this story?
6:46你们为什么称呼我主阿，主阿，却不遵我的话行呢？6:47凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，我要告诉你们他像什么人。6:48他像一个人盖房子，深深地挖地，把根基安在磐石上。到发大水的时候，水冲那房子，房子总不能摇动。因为根基立在磐石上。有古卷作因为盖造得好6:49惟有听见不去行的，就像一个人在土地上盖房子，没有根基。水一冲，随即倒塌了，并且那房子坏得很大。我们就如比喻里的人一样是建造者。我们在建造我们的人生。从这个故事中我们可以学到什么建造人生的教训？




** The Bible refers to Jesus disciples many times. Below is information about the disciples for future reference.
圣经里许多地方都提到耶稣的门徒。下面是关于这12个门徒的介绍，可作为以后学习中的参考。

Simon (or Peter) was a native of Bethsaida. He lived in Capernaum by the Sea of Galilee with his wife and mother-in-law and was a fisherman. In the list of the Apostles his name is always mentioned first. He was impulsive, frank, and energetic. He was the first to confess and the first to deny his Savior. Together with John he carried the Gospel to Samaria and he was the first to preach to the Gentiles. He wrote 2 epistles (letters), 1st and 2nd Peter to the Christians in Asia Minor. He died in Rome under Nero, 68 A.D.
西门（或彼得）是伯赛大人。他同他的妻子和岳母一起住在加利利湖边的迦百农，他是一个渔夫。在12 使徒中，他的名字总是被列在第一位。彼得是一个坦率，易冲动，又充满活力的人。他既是第一个承认同时又是第一个否认耶稣是他的救主的人。他同约翰一起把福音传到撒玛利亚地区。他也是第一个向外邦人传教的人。他写了两封书信（使徒书），彼得前书和彼得后书，给小亚细亚的基督徒。他死于尼禄执政时期的罗马，约在公元68年。

Andrewwas the brother of Peter and also a fisherman. Originally he was a disciple of John the Baptist, whom he left to follow Jesus. He had a kind disposition, always ready to help.
安德烈是彼得的兄弟，也是一个渔夫。他原本是施洗约翰的门徒，后来跟随了耶稣。他人很随和，总是想要去帮助别人。

Johnwas the son of Zebedee, a fisherman of Bethsaida and his mother was Salome (probably a sister of Mary), hence a cousin of Jesus. His father seems to have had a comfortable lifestyle as he had hired servants (Mark 1:20). He too had been a disciple of John, but left him to follow Jesus. He belonged to the intimate circle of Jesus and was known as the disciple whom Jesus loved. He had a tender heart and a burning zeal for Jesus. His zeal as well as his brother James caused him to ask the Lord for permission to “command fire to come down from heaven and consume” certain villagers of Samaria who refused to take in Jesus. This is why James and John were given the name “the sons of thunder”. When Jesus was crucified, John was asked to care for Jesus mother. He was the only disciple to die a natural death at the age of 100. He wrote the fourth Gospel, 3 epistles, and Revelation. He wrote the Gospel to show that “Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God”, to expose heretics, and to supplement the first three Gospels. The other books mainly record what Jesus did in Galilee and John spoke of Jesus activity in Judea.
约翰是西庇太的儿子，伯赛大的一个渔夫，他的母亲是莎乐美（可能是玛利亚的姐妹），所以约翰是耶稣的表兄弟。他的父亲可能是过着比较舒适的生活，因为他还雇佣人（来伺候他）（马可福音1：20）。他（约翰，西庇太的儿子）也是施洗约翰的门徒，后来跟随了耶稣。他与耶稣的关系亲近，是耶稣钟爱的门徒。他有一颗温柔的心，对耶稣也是一腔热忱。他和他弟兄雅各对耶稣的热忱使得他们要神让他们“吩咐火从天上降下烧灭”那些拒绝耶稣的撒玛利亚村民。这就是为什么雅各和约翰被称为“雷子”的原因。当耶稣被钉十架时，耶稣的母亲被交托给约翰照顾。他也是唯一一位自然死亡的门徒，他活了100岁。他写了第四本福音书，三份书信和启示录。他写的约翰福音是要显明“耶稣就是基督，神的儿子”，要揭露异端，并为其他三本福音书作补充。其他三本福音书主要记录了耶稣在加利利的事，而约翰讲到了耶稣在犹太的活动。

James the Elder(given this name so not to be confused with the other disciple with the name James) was the brother of John and probably older) With Peter and John he was present at the raising of Jairus’ daughter, at the transfiguration, and when Christ was in the Gethsemane. It is said that he was looked upon as the leader and representative of the first Christian congregation at Jerusalem. While his brother John was the last to die of all the Apostles, he was the first.
大雅各（这样称以避免与另一个叫雅各的门徒混淆）是约翰的弟兄（可能是哥哥）。他和彼得约翰都见证了睚鲁女儿的复活，（登山）变像和基督在客西马尼园。他被视为耶路撒冷第一个基督教会的领袖和代表。虽然他的弟兄约翰是所有使徒中最后一个离世的，他却是第一个。

Philipwas also a native of Bethsaida. Very little is known of his life. He was one of the disciples of John the Baptist and brought Batholomew (Nathanael) to Jesus.
腓力也是伯赛大人。对于他的人生所知甚少。他是施洗约翰的门徒之一。是他带巴多罗买（拿但业）见耶稣的。

Bartholomew (also known as Nathanael) was a native of Cana, in Galilee. He is said to have proclaimed the Gospel in East India, where he eventually died.
巴多罗买（也叫拿但业）是加利利的迦南人。据说他在东印度传福音，最后也在那里离世。

Matthewis also called Levi, the tax collector. The story of his calling is found in Luke 5:27-32. He was not an ordinary tax collector, but a customhouse official at the landing place of ships on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. He is thought to have been a wealthy man. He seems to have had the Jews in mind when he wrote the first Gospel, hence many Old Testament references.
马太也叫利未，是税吏。他被召的故事记录在路加福音5：27-32。他不是一般的税吏，而是加利利海岸上泊船处的海关官员。他被认为是一个富有的人。在他写马太福音时，他心里想的是犹太人，所以马太福音里引有许多旧约的经文。

Thomas is an apostle we are not told much about. The name means twin. We hear more about Thomas in John 20:24-29. He preached in Southern India.
关于圣徒多马，圣经里没有很多记载。他的名字“多马”有“一对”的意思。我们会在约翰福音 20：24-29中学到更多关于他的事。他在南印度传福音。
James the Lessis designated thus to distinguish him from James, the brother of John. He was a son of Alpheus (who was a brother of Joseph). He presided at the Apostolic Council, Acts 15. He worked in the southwestern part of Palestine.
小雅各，这样称呼是为了要与约翰的弟兄雅各区分开来。他是亚勒腓（约瑟的弟兄）的儿子。他主持了使徒行传15里记载的使徒大会。他在巴勒斯坦西南部工作。

Simon the Zealotnot to be confused with Simon Peter. The Zealots were a Jewish party opposed to the Roman rule. It is believed that Simon was a former member as their beliefs and methods were at odds with the teachings of Jesus.
奋锐党的西门，不要把他与西门彼得混淆。奋锐党是反对罗马统治的犹太党派。西门被认为曾是奋锐党一员。他们的信条与做事的方法与耶稣的教导违背。

Jude, brother of James the Less, is not the same as Judas Iscariot. He sometimes called Thaddaeus. He is the author of the Epistle of Jude.
犹大，小雅各的弟兄，同加略人犹大不是同一个人。有时，他被叫做达太。他是犹大书的作者。

Judas Iscariotthe disciple who betrayed Jesus. Iscariot means “the man of Kerioth”. Kerioth is a town in Judea. He was the treasurer. After betraying Christ, he hanged himself.
加略人犹大是出卖耶稣的那个门徒。加略是犹太的一个城。他是司库。出卖耶稣后，他上吊自杀。
