路加福音 Luke 19:1-48
Luke 19:1-48
路加福音 19：1-48
            After Jesus healed the blind man, he was passing through Jericho, when there was an interruption.
在耶稣治愈了瞎眼的之后，祂途经耶利哥城，在那里又遇上一些事。

Zacchaeus the Tax Collector稅吏撒该
1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. What do you remember about Jericho? 2 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. What do we learn about Zacchaeus? 3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. Why do you think Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus?  4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
1耶稣进了耶利哥，正经过的时候，关于耶利哥，你还记得什么？2有一个人名叫撒该，作税吏长，是个财主。从这里我们知道撒该是做什么的？3他要看看耶稣是怎样的人；只因人多，他的身量又矮，所以不得看见，你认为撒该为什么想要见耶稣？4就跑到前头，爬上桑树，要看耶稣，因为耶稣必从那里经过。
   5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”What is unusual about this invitation? 6 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
   7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.” Why did the people mutter?
   8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”What happened during Jesus stay at Zacchaeus house? How did Zacchaeus respond to Jesus message?
   9 Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. In what way was Zacchaeus a son of Abraham? 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” What is Jesus mission?
       5耶稣到了那里，抬头一看，对他说：「撒该，快下来！今天我必住在你家里。」耶稣的要求有什么不同寻常之处？6他就急忙下来，欢欢喜喜地接待耶稣。7众人看见，都私下议论说：「他竟到罪人家里去住宿。」众人为什么私下议论？8撒该站着对主说：「主啊，我把所有的一半给穷人；我若讹诈了谁，就还他四倍。」耶稣在撒该家停留期间发生了什么事情？撒该是如何回应耶稣的信息的？9耶稣说：「今天救恩到了这家，因为他也是亚伯拉罕的子孙。10人子来，为要寻找、拯救失丧的人。」撒该为何是亚伯拉罕的子孙？

Notes注释
Sycamore-fig tree - This tree does not grow to a great height, but has many spreading branches. The tree bears fruit for more than half a year. The fruit is pear-shaped, and the small green figs appear before the leaves. It offered shade.
桑树–这种树长得并不高，但是却枝繁叶茂。这树的结实期长达半年多。果实如梨状，小的青无花果在叶子之前就长出来了。桑树也遮阳。

The Parable of the Ten Minas十锭银子的比喻
11 While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once. What kind of king did many still think Jesus was? 12 He said: “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. Who is the man of noble birth? Where is the distant country? And then what was the man going to do? 13 So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’ What were the servants to do with the minas? What do you think the minas represent?
11众人正在听见这些话的时候，耶稣因为将近耶路撒冷，又因他们以为　神的国快要显出来，就另设一个比喻，说：许多人仍然认为耶稣是一位什么样的君王？12「有一个贵胄往远方去，要得国回来，这个贵胄是谁？远方是哪里？这个人要做什么事情？13便叫了他的十个仆人来，交给他们十锭银子，说：『你们去做生意，直等我回来。』这些仆人要用这些银子做什么？你认为这银子代表什么？
   14 “But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to be our king.’ Who were the subjects who hated the king?
   15 “He was made king, however, and returned home. What happened to the man of noble birth? Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. What did the king expect?
   16 “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’ What results did the first servant have with his mina?
   17 “‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’ What is the servant's reward?
   18 “The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’ What results did the second servant have with his mina?
   19 “His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’ What is the servant's reward?
   14他本国的人却恨他，打发使者随后去，说：『我们不愿意这个人作我们的王。』恨这王的本国人是谁？15他既得国回来，这个贵胄发生了什么事？就吩咐叫那领银子的仆人来，要知道他们做生意赚了多少。这个王（对仆人）有什么样的期待？16头一个上来，说：『主啊，你的一锭银子已经赚了十锭。』第一个仆人用他的银子赚得了什么收获？17主人说：『好！良善的仆人，你既在最小的事上有忠心，可以有权柄管十座城。』这个仆人的奖赏是什么？18第二个来，说：『主啊，你的一锭银子已经赚了五锭。』第二个仆人用他的银子赚得了什么收获？19 主人说：『你也可以管五座城。』这个仆人的奖赏是什么？
   20 “Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth. What did the next servant do with his mina? 21 I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’ What do we learn about this servant?
   22 “His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow? 23 Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?’Why was the king angry?  
   24 “Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’ What happened to the mina?
   25 “‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’
   26 “He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away. 27 But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and kill them in front of me.’” What is going to happen on Judgment Day?
What does the parable teach us about Jesus expectations for His servants use of His Gospel?
20又有一个来说：『主啊，看哪，你的一锭银子在这里，我把它包在手巾里存着。这个仆人用他的银子做了什么？21我原是怕你，因为你是严厉的人；没有放下的，还要去拿，没有种下的，还要去收。』从这里我们可以了解到这个仆人是什么样的人？22主人对他说：『你这恶仆，我要凭你的口定你的罪。你既知道我是严厉的人，没有放下的，还要去拿，没有种下的，还要去收，23为什么不把我的银子交给银行，等我来的时候，连本带利都可以要回来呢？』主人为什么生气？24就对旁边站着的人说：『夺过他这一锭来，给那有十锭的。』如何处置了他的银子？25他们说：『主啊，他已经有十锭了。』26主人说：『我告诉你们，凡有的，还要加给他；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。27至于我那些仇敌，不要我作他们王的，把他们拉来，在我面前杀了吧！』」审判日要发生什么事情？从这个比喻中我们学到耶稣对于祂的仆人在运用福音上有什么样的期待？

Notes注释
Minas - One mina is about 3 months wages.
银子– 一锭银子相当于三个月的工钱。

Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King (Palm Sunday)凯旋入京（棕枝主日）
            Luke begins his account of the week of Jesus' passion with this incident. Since His twelfth year Jesus had often gone to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. It was a springtime Sunday in about the year 30 A.D. The holy city of Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims who had come for the annual Passover celebration. The pilgrims who had come to the Holy City doubted that Jesus would come to the Festival this time, because the High Council had ordered Jesus arrest.
            路加以这个事件开始他对耶稣受难周的记载。自从祂出来传道的第十二年起，耶稣就经常到耶路撒冷去过逾越节。当时是在大约公元30年的春季的一个星期天。耶路撒冷圣城到处都是前来过逾越节的朝圣者。来到圣城的朝圣者对于耶稣会在这个时候来这里过节感到怀疑，因为公会已下令要逮捕耶稣。
            Jesus had spent many months traveling through the towns and villages of Palestine. He preached about the kingdom of God and healed the sick wherever He went. Now the time had come for Him to claim His title as the Messiah - the Savior that God had promised to the Jewish people.
Jesus knew His mission was almost finished. As they traveled to Jerusalem, Jesus warned His disciples that He would soon be put to death, and after three days He would rise again.
           耶稣已在巴勒斯坦的众城镇乡村中游历了许多个月。祂在所到之处传讲神的国，医治患病的。而现在是时候要宣告祂做为弥赛亚—神应许给以色列人的救主--的身份。耶稣知道祂的使命就要完成了。在他们去耶路撒冷的路上，耶稣告诫祂的门徒祂不久就要被处死，并在第三天复活。
            In the following verses we read how Jesus made preparations for a royal entry into the city. However when He came as King, He was a spiritual King, the King of His church.
           在以下的经文中我们读到耶稣是如何来为祂凯旋进京做准备的。然而，祂是以一位属灵的君王，祂教会的君王，而来的。

    28 After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. 29 As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, 30 “Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. 31 If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it.’” What did Jesus request? What does this incidence tell us about Jesus?
   28耶稣说完了这话，就在前面走，上耶路撒冷去。29将近伯法其和伯大尼，在一座山名叫橄榄山那里，就打发两个门徒，说：30「你们往对面村子里去，进去的时候，必看见一匹驴驹拴在那里，是从来没有人骑过的，可以解开牵来。31若有人问为什么解它，你们就说：『主要用它。』耶稣要他们做什么？从这件事中有关耶稣我们都学到了什么？
   32 Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them. 33 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?” What did the disciples find?
   34 They replied, “The Lord needs it.”
   35 They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it. Why would the disciples put their garments upon the colt? 36 As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road. How did the people treat Jesus?
   37 When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:
   38 “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!”
   “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” How did the people respond to Jesus entry?
    32 打发的人去了，所遇见的正如耶稣所说的。33 他们解驴驹的时候，主人问他们说：「解驴驹做什么？」门徒们发现了什么？34 他们说：「主要用它。」35 他们牵到耶稣那里，把自己的衣服搭在上面，扶着耶稣骑上。门徒们为什么要把自己的衣服搭在驴驹上？36 走的时候，众人把衣服铺在路上。众人如何待耶稣的？37 将近耶路撒冷，正下橄榄山的时候，众门徒因所见过的一切异能，都欢乐起来，大声赞美　神，38 说：
奉主名来的王是应当称颂的！
在天上有和平；
在至高之处有荣光。见到耶稣进京，众人是什么反应？

   39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” How did the Pharisees respond to Jesus entry?
   40 “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.” [Matthew 3:9 - "And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father. I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children of Abraham".] What do you think "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out" means?
   41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 42 and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. What had the people refuse to believe?  43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. What is going to happen to the city? 44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.” What will happen to the people? Why?
            The prophecy of Christ came only too true. In the year 70  the Romans took and destroyed Jerusalem. The siege is one of the most terrible on record.
      39 众人中有几个法利赛人对耶稣说：「夫子，责备你的门徒吧！」对于耶稣进京，法利赛人作何反应？40 耶稣说：「我告诉你们，若是他们闭口不说，这些石头必要呼叫起来。」[马太福音 3：9 –“不要自己心里说：『有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。』我告诉你们，　神能从这些石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。”]你认为“若是他们闭口不说，这些石头必要呼叫起来”这指的是什么意思？
41 耶稣快到耶路撒冷，看见城，就为它哀哭，42 说：「巴不得你在这日子知道关系你平安的事；无奈这事现在是隐藏的，叫你的眼看不出来。众人拒绝相信什么？43 因为日子将到，你的仇敌必筑起土垒，周围环绕你，四面困住你，这城会发生什么事？44 并要扫灭你和你里头的儿女，连一块石头也不留在石头上，因你不知道眷顾你的时候。」会有什么事发生在众人身上？为什么？

Notes注释
Bethphage - A village near Bethany
伯法其– 伯大尼附近的一个村庄。

Mount of Olives - The Mount of Lives is not a single peak, but a ridge having no fewer than four summits. The elevation is less than 900 meters above sea level. The Mount of Lives is separated from Jerusalem by the Valley of Kidron.
橄榄山 – 橄榄山不是只有一个山峰，而是有不少于四个山峰的山脉。山海拔不到900米。橄榄山与耶路撒冷相隔一个汲沦谷。

Jesus at the Temple耶稣在圣殿
    45 When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. 46 “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be a house of prayer’; but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’” What is Jesus condemning by driving the merchants from the temple area?
   47 Every day he was teaching at the temple. What did Jesus continue to do? But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. 48 Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.
45 耶稣进了殿，赶出里头做买卖的人，46 对他们说：「经上说：我的殿必作祷告的殿，你们倒使它成为贼窝了。」耶稣将在殿里做买卖的人赶出来，祂这样做是在谴责什么？47 耶稣天天在殿里教训人。接着耶稣又做了什么？祭司长和文士与百姓的尊长都想要杀他，48 但寻不出法子来，因为百姓都侧耳听他。

Notes注释
Drive out those who were selling - Cattle and doves were required for the sacrifices in the temple. It was also necessary that they be offered for sale to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Jerusalem. But this buying and selling did not have to be done in the temple area. The traders had made a stockyard out of the court.
赶出里头做买卖的人 --- 在殿中献祭，牛和鸽子是必须的。对于那些成千上万的来耶路撒冷的朝圣者，必须要在当地可以买到这些祭祀用的牲畜才行。但是这样的买卖没必要一定要在圣殿里进行。商人已把圣殿的外邦人院变成了牲畜围场。
