路加福音Luke 9:1-62

A new phase of Jesus' ministry began when he sent out the apostles to do the type of preaching, teaching and healing that they had observed him doing. This was the third tour of Galilee by Jesus and His disciples. On the first tour Jesus traveled with the four fishermen and on the second all 12 were with him

耶稣的事工开始了一个新的阶段，祂差遣门徒去传讲、教导和医治，就是门徒们曾看到耶稣所亲自做的工作。这是耶稣和祂的门徒的第三次加利利之旅。第一次的时候耶稣和那四个渔夫一起行动，第二次的时候十二个门徒都和祂在一起。

Jesus Sends Out the Twelve
    1When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, How were the disciples to use the power and authority that Jesus had given to them? 2and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. What type of trip was this? 3He told them: "Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic. Who was going to provide for the disciples welfare? 4Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town. Why do you think the disciples were to stay at one house? 5If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them." What does it mean to "shake off the dust?" 6So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.
1 耶稣叫齐了十二个门徒，给他们能力、权柄，制伏一切的鬼，医治各样的病，那些门徒是怎样使用耶稣赐给他们的权柄和能力的？2 又差遣他们去宣传　神国的道，医治病人，这是一种什么样的旅行？3 对他们说：「行路的时候，不要带拐杖和口袋，不要带食物和银子，也不要带两件褂子。谁将供应门徒们的生活需要？4 无论进哪一家，就住在那里，也从那里起行。你认为门徒为什么要只住在一家里？5 凡不接待你们的，你们离开那城的时候，要把脚上的尘土跺下去，见证他们的不是。」“把脚上的尘土跺下去”是什么意思？6 门徒就出去，走遍各乡宣传福音，到处治病。
    7Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, 8others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. 9But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" Why was Herod particularly troubled by the reports of the disciples' mission activity? And he tried to see him. For what reason would Herod want to see Jesus?
7 分封的王希律听见耶稣所做的一切事，就游移不定；因为有人说：「是约翰从死里复活」；8 又有人说：「是以利亚显现」；还有人说：「是古时的一个先知又活了。」9 希律说：「约翰我已经斩了，这却是什么人？我竟听见他这样的事呢？」为什么希律特别对门徒传福音的事工感到困惑？就想要见他。希律想见耶稣的原因是什么？

Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand This is the only miracle besides Jesus' resurrection that is reported in all four Gospels. Jesus had been in the area of Capernaum.
耶稣喂饱五千人这是除了耶稣复活以外唯一在四部福音书里都有记载的神迹。耶稣那时在加百农的地方。
    10When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, 11but the crowds learned about it and followed him. Why would the disciples and Jesus want to withdraw? Why would the crowds want to follow Him? He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. What did Jesus first feed?  What message do you think Jesus gave them?    12Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here." Why did the disciples want to send the people away?
10 使徒回来，将所做的事告诉耶稣，耶稣就带他们暗暗地离开那里，往一座城去；那城名叫伯赛大。为什么门徒和耶稣要离开？人们为什么要追随耶稣？11 但众人知道了，就跟着他去；耶稣便接待他们，对他们讲论　神国的道，医治那些需医的人。耶稣先分享了什么？你觉得耶稣会给他们讲什么信息？12 日头快要平西，十二个门徒来对他说：「请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去借宿找吃的，因为我们这里是野地。」门徒为什么想叫众人散开？
    13He replied, "You give them something to eat." What is Jesus' purpose in directing the disciples to give them something to eat?
   They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd." Why would someone have brought 5 loaves and 2 fish? 14(About five thousand men were there.)
   But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each." Why sit in groups?15The disciples did so, and everybody sat down. 16Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. What did the people witness? Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people. 17They all ate and were satisfied, How much was provided?and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.Think of 3 reasons why Jesus fed the people? How are we fed today?
13 耶稣说：「你们给他们吃吧！」耶稣指引门徒去给他们吃的目的是什么？门徒说：「我们不过有五个饼，两条鱼，若不去为这许多人买食物就不够。」为什么有人会带五个饼、两条鱼？14 那时，人数约有五千。耶稣对门徒说：「叫他们一排一排地坐下，每排大约五十个人。」为什么要坐成一排？15 门徒就如此行，叫众人都坐下。16 耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望着天祝福，擘开，人们见证了什么？递给门徒，摆在众人面前。17 他们就吃，并且都吃饱了；耶稣供应了多少的需要？把剩下的零碎收拾起来，装满了十二篮子。请说出三个为什么耶稣喂饱众人的原因？我们今天是如何被供应的呢？

NOTES
注释
Bethsaida - Located on the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee.
伯赛大-坐落在加利利海的东北边。
Broke them – They were hard, similar to crackers.
擘开- 饼很硬，有点儿像饼干。
Basketfuls - The baskets were small wicker baskets, commonly used by the Jews, especially to carry clean food. They were made of bushes, reeds, or ropes. Each of the twelve disciples seems to have had one for carrying a supply of provisions for themselves and their Master.
篮子- 这里的篮子是指小型的柳条筐，犹太人的生活常用品，常常用来携带洁净的食品。通常用灌木、芦苇制成。可能十二个门徒每个人都带有一个这样的篮子、携带自己和他们主人的食品。
Peter's Confession of Christ
    18Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
    19They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life." Whose answer was similar to this one?
    20"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
      Peter answered, "The Christof God." How is Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ different from the opinions of others?
18 耶稣自己祷告的时候，门徒也同他在那里。耶稣问他们说：「众人说我是谁？」19 他们说：「有人说是施洗的约翰；有人说是以利亚；还有人说是古时的一个先知又活了。」谁的答案和这个很像？20耶稣说：「你们说我是谁？」彼得回答说：「是　神所立的基督。」彼得认信耶稣是基督和其他的答案有什么不同？
    21Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. 22And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
Look at verse 22. How was Jesus' first (of three) predictions of His passion and resurrection... Necessary? ... Surprising?... Revealing?... Clear?
 耶稣切切地嘱咐他们，不可将这事告诉人，22 又说：「人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长，和文士弃绝，并且被杀，第三日复活。请看22节耶稣是如何第一次（一共三次）预言祂的受难和复活的？必须吗？......很突然吗？......有所启示吗？......清楚吗？
」    23Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. What does Jesus say is required of a person to be a true disciple? How often? 24For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. Explain verse 24. 25What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? 26If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. What event is Jesus referring to? 27I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God." What are the disciples to understand?
23 耶稣又对众人说：「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，天天背起他的十字架来跟从我。耶稣所一个人要做一个真信徒需要什么条件？有多需要？24 因为，凡要救自己生命的，必丧掉生命；凡为我丧掉生命的，必救了生命。请解释24节25 人若赚得全世界，却丧了自己，赔上自己，有什么益处呢？26 凡把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在自己的荣耀里，并天父与圣天使的荣耀里降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。耶稣所指的是什么时候？27 我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必看见　神的国。」门徒怎么理解这些的？
The Transfiguration
    28About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. Why did Jesus to up into the mountain? 29As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. What would happen if we saw a flash of lightening close up? Why had the disciples never seen Jesus like this before?30Two men, Moses and Elijah, 31appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. What do you know about Moses? about Elijah? They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. What was Jesus departure? What was Jesus soon going to fulfill? 32Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 33As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)
    34While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. 35A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; Who was speaking? What was the message?  When had a voice from heaven spoken before?listen to him." What does it mean to listen to Him? 36When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen. What are some possible reasons Jesus did not want the disciples to tell anyone? When were the disciples able to tell what they had seen? What can we tell people?
登山变相
28 说了这话以后约有八天，耶稣带着彼得、约翰、雅各上山去祷告。为什么耶稣要上山去?29 正祷告的时候，他的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光。如果我们靠近看闪光会怎样？为什么门徒从未见过耶稣如此？30 忽然有摩西、以利亚两个人同耶稣说话；你对摩西和以利亚都知道些什么？31 他们在荣光里显现，谈论耶稣去世的事，就是他在耶路撒冷将要成的事。什么是耶稣去世，耶稣很快将要成就什么？32 彼得和他的同伴都打盹，既清醒了，就看见耶稣的荣光，并同他站着的那两个人。33 二人正要和耶稣分离的时候，彼得对耶稣说：「夫子，我们在这里真好！可以搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。」他却不知道所说的是什么。34 说这话的时候，有一朵云彩来遮盖他们；他们进入云彩里就惧怕。35 有声音从云彩里出来，说：「这是我的儿子，我所拣选的，是谁在说话？传达了什么样的信息？从前什么时候有过从天上来的声音？你们要听他。」“你们要听祂”是什么意思？36 声音住了，只见耶稣一人在那里。当那些日子，门徒不提所看见的事，一样也不告诉人。What are some possible reasons Jesus did not want the disciples to tell anyone? When were the disciples able to tell what they had seen? What can we tell people?耶稣要门徒一样也不告诉人，可能是因为怎样的原因？门徒们什么时候可以说出他们所看到的？我们可以告诉人们什么？
NOTES
注释

Peter, James, and John – These three disciples appear to an especially close relationship to Jesus. These three disciples were also present at Jairus daughter healing and were asked to pray with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.
彼得，雅各和约翰-这三个门徒显得和耶稣有特别亲近的关系。这三个门徒也见证了睚鲁的女儿得医治并且耶稣在客西马尼园祷告的时候也要他们一起。
Appearance of His face changed (Transfigured) – Jesus appearance changed and became indescribably glorious.
祂的面貌就改变了（变容）-耶稣的面貌改变并且变得无法形容的荣耀。
Moses and Elijah – Moses represented the Law and Elijah represented the Old Testament prophets. Moses had been buried by God Himself and Elijah was transported to heaven with body and soul, in a chariot of fire. Both their bodies on being taken into heaven were changed, glorified.
摩西和以利亚-摩西代表着律法，以利亚代表着旧约的先知。摩西离世的时候被神接去，以利亚的身体和灵魂一起架着火车火马到天上去。他们的身体在被带到天上去的时候都曾被改变，被荣耀。
Three shelters – Peter may have desired to erect new tents of meeting where God could again communicate with his people.

The Healing of a Boy With an Evil Spirit
治好被污鬼附身的孩子
    37The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. When does this event occur? 38A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. 39A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. Describe seizures. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. 40I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not." Why do you think the disciples could not drive out the demon?
 第二天，他们下了山，就有许多人迎见耶稣。这件事发生在什么时候？38 其中有一人喊叫说：「夫子！求你看顾我的儿子，因为他是我的独生子。39 他被鬼抓住就忽然喊叫；鬼又叫他抽风，口中流沫，描述一下抽风。并且重重地伤害他，难以离开他。40 我求过你的门徒，把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。」你认为门徒为什么不能赶出这鬼？
    41"O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Who is Jesus speaking to? Bring your son here." Who is Jesus speaking to now?
    42Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. When have you read about evil spirits recognizing Jesus? What is the spirit resisting? But Jesus rebuked the evilspirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. What does Jesus show? 43And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. Why should this surprise you?
41 耶稣说：「嗳！这又不信又悖谬的世代啊，我在你们这里，忍耐你们要到几时呢？耶稣在向谁说话？将你的儿子带到这里来吧！」耶稣这次在对谁说？42 正来的时候，鬼把他摔倒，叫他重重地抽风。你还在哪里读到污鬼认出耶稣的事？污鬼在抵抗什么？耶稣就斥责那污鬼，把孩子治好了，交给他父亲。耶稣表现出什么？43 众人都诧异　神的大能。这件事为什么能使你觉的诧异？
   While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, 44"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men." What is Jesus predicting? 45But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. Why do you think the disciples were afraid? Should we be afraid to go to Jesus? Explain your answer.
43耶稣所做的一切事，众人正希奇的时候，耶稣对门徒说：44 「你们要把这些话存在耳中，因为人子将要被交在人手里。」耶稣预言了什么？45 他们不明白这话，意思乃是隐藏的，叫他们不能明白，他们也不敢问这话的意思。你觉得门徒为什么会害怕？我们来到耶稣面前的时候应该觉得害怕吗？请解释你的答案。


NOTES
注释

Spirit seizes him - The evil spirit was causing seizures. At this time, evil spirits were responsible for many kinds of afflictions: mental disorder, violent action, bodily disease, and rebellion against God.
他被鬼抓住 - 污鬼能使人抽风。这一次污鬼导致了很多种折磨：神志不清，暴行，身体上的疾病，并且背逆抵挡神。

Who Will Be the Greatest
谁最伟大
    46An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. What were the disciples really saying?  47Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. 48Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. What is spiritual childlikeness? For he who is least among you all—he is the greatest." What is Jesus teaching His disciples about true greatness in this account?
46 门徒中间起了议论，谁将为大。门徒们实际上在说什么？47 耶稣看出他们心中的议论，就领一个小孩子来，叫他站在自己旁边，48 对他们说：「凡为我名接待这小孩子的，就是接待我；凡接待我的，就是接待那差我来的。什么是属灵的单纯？你们中间最小的，他便为大。」耶稣对他门徒在这件事上关于真的伟大的教导是什么？
    49"Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us." Why were the disciples trying to stop the man driving out demons?
    50"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you." What is Jesus trying to help the disciples realize?
49 约翰说：「夫子，我们看见一个人奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不与我们一同跟从你。」门徒为什么要禁止人赶鬼？50 耶稣说：「不要禁止他；因为不敌挡你们的，就是帮助你们的。」耶稣要帮助门徒们明白什么？

Samaritan Opposition
不接待主的村庄
    51As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. What is Jesus anticipating? 52And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; What were the disciples going to do to get things ready for Jesus? 53but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. Why would Jesus heading to Jerusalem bother the people in the Samaritan village?  54When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?" Why would the disciples want to call down fire? 55But Jesus turned and rebuked them, Why did Jesus refuse? 56and they went to another village.
51 耶稣被接上升的日子将到，他就定意向耶路撒冷去，耶稣预期什么？52 便打发使者在他前头走。他们到了撒马利亚的一个村庄，要为他预备。门徒要去为耶稣预备什么？53 那里的人不接待他，因他面向耶路撒冷去。耶稣向耶路撒冷去为什么要经过撒玛利亚？4 他的门徒雅各、约翰看见了，就说：「主啊，你要我们吩咐火从天上降下来烧灭他们，像以利亚所做的吗？」为什么门徒想吩咐火从天上降下来？55 耶稣转身责备两个门徒，说：「你们的心如何，你们并不知道。耶稣为什么拒绝？56 人子来不是要灭人的性命，是要救人的性命。」说着就往别的村庄去了。

NOTES
注释

Set out for Jerusalem - This marks the beginning of a period of ministry in Judea, of which Jerusalem was the central city. The journey is during the Feast of Tabernacles - The greatest feast in the Jewish year, celebrating the completion of harvest and commemorating God's goodness to the people during the desert wanderings. The name came from the leafy shelters in which people lived throughout the seven days of the Feast.
向耶路撒冷去- 这里标志着在犹大地，以耶路撒冷为中心城市的地区的事工的开始。这次旅程在住棚节期间。
住棚节- 这是犹大年历中最大的节日，为庆祝收获和几年神在旷野里对人的实行的神迹。
Samaritan village - Samaritans were particularly hostile to Jews who were on their way to observe religious festivals in Jerusalem. It was at least a three-day journey from Galilee to Jerusalem through Samaria, and Samaritans routinely refused overnight shelter for the pilgrims.
撒玛利亚人的一个村庄-撒玛利亚人特别的敌视去耶路撒冷守宗教节日的犹太人，从加利利刀耶路撒冷的旅程要有三天从撒玛利亚经过，而撒玛利亚人通常拒绝朝圣者留宿过夜。

The Cost of Following Jesus
    57As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go." What does the man want?
    58Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." What does Jesus want the man to realize?
    59He said to another man, "Follow me."
      But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." Was the father dead? What was the man really telling Jesus?
    60Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
    61 Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family." What is the man's condition to follow Jesus?
62Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God." What the response of Jesus tell us?
跟从耶稣的代价
57 他们走路的时候，有一人对耶稣说：「你无论往哪里去，我要跟从你。」这个人想要什么？58 耶稣说：「狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，只是人子没有枕头的地方。」耶稣是要告诉这个人什么？59 又对一个人说：「跟从我来！」那人说：「主，容我先回去埋葬我的父亲。」他的父亲已经去世了吗？这个人实际上向耶稣表达了什么意思？60 耶稣说：「任凭死人埋葬他们的死人，你只管去传扬　神国的道。」61 又有一人说：「主，我要跟从你，但容我先去辞别我家里的人。」这个人跟随耶稣的条件是什么？62 耶稣说：「手扶着犁向后看的，不配进　神的国。」耶稣的回应给了我们是什么教导？

What lesson do all three incidents teach?
这三件事给了我们什么教导？
