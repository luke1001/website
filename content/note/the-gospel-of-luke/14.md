路加福音 Luke 15:1-32
Luke 15:1-32
路加福音 15章:1-32节
The central theme of the entire chapter is "God's love for the lost". Jesus speaks the three parables to tax collectors and sinners as well as to the Pharisees and scribes who had gathered to hear Him.
本章的中心主题是“神对罪人的爱”耶稣向那些挨近祂的税吏、罪人及法利赛人和文士讲了这三个比喻。

The Parable of the Lost Sheep
1 Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” Tell what you remember about the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. What does it mean to mutter? What was Jesus guilty of?
3 Then Jesus told them this parable: 4 “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. How would the master react if the shepherd lost one of his sheep? Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ What is the shepherd's reaction when he finds the lost sheep? 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent. What does Jesus want the Pharisees and the teachers of the law to learn?
失羊的比喻
1 众税吏和罪人都挨近耶稣，要听他讲道。2 法利赛人和文士私下议论说：「这个人接待罪人，又同他们吃饭。」你知道什么是法利赛人和文士吗？私下议论指的是什么？耶稣有什么过错？3 耶稣就用比喻说：4 「你们中间谁有一百只羊失去一只，如果牧人丢失了主人的一只羊，主人会有什么反应？不把这九十九只撇在旷野、去找那失去的羊，直到找着呢？5 找着了，就欢欢喜喜地扛在肩上，回到家里，6 就请朋友邻舍来，对他们说：『我失去的羊已经找着了，你们和我一同欢喜吧！』牧人找到了丢失的羊后做了什么？7 我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人欢喜更大。」耶稣想要法利赛人和文士学到什么？
Notes注释
Tax collectors – These were Jews who were greatly despised by other Jews because they were in the service of the hated Roman government collecting taxes and many times, more taxes than they should.
税吏– 这是一群被本族人厌弃的犹太人，因为他们为可恨的罗马政府收税还常常贪污。
A sinner was a term commonly used to mean adulterers, robbers and the like. In today’s language we would call them the scum of society. To eat with them was a sign of friendship.
罪人– 通常是指通奸者、强盗一类的人，用当代的话说就是社会渣滓。和他们一起吃饭意味着友谊。

Then Jesus told them (Pharisees and teachers of the laws) these parables.
接着耶稣向他们（法利赛人和文士）说了这些比喻
Parable – Parables are a comparison or an illustration. They are usually stories out of ordinary life used to illustrate spiritual or moral truths; they had a single main point. Parables were particularly effective and easy to remember because Jesus used familiar scenes. Although parables clarified Jesus’ teaching, they also included hidden meanings needing further explanation. These hidden meanings challenged the sincerely interested to further inquiry, and taught truths that Jesus wanted to conceal from unbelievers.
比喻– 比喻是比较或形象的阐明。通常是用生活中的故事来说明属灵或道德的真理；比喻都有一个要点。耶稣使用熟悉的场景使之对人们有深刻的印象并且容易记忆。尽管比喻清楚的阐明了耶稣的教导，但也包含着隐含的意义需要进一步的解释。这些隐藏的含义激励那些有意真诚寻求的人有更多追求，并教导那向不信的人隐藏的真理
From parables Jesus’ enemies could find no direct statements to use against him. This does not express a desire that some would not understand, but simply states the sad truth that those who are not willing to receive Jesus’ message will find the truth hidden from them.
从比喻中耶稣的敌人找不到可用来抵挡祂的直接证据。这并不是说有意要让一些人不明白而是说明这样的一个令人遗憾的真理：那些不愿意接受耶稣信息的人会发现真理向他们隐藏了起来。

The Parable of the Lost Coin
8 “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ 10 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
失钱的比喻
8 「或是一个妇人有十块钱，若失落一块，岂不点上灯，打扫屋子，细细地找，直到找着吗？9 找着了，就请朋友邻舍来，对他们说：『我失落的那块钱已经找着了，你们和我一同欢喜吧！』10 我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在　神的使者面前也是这样为他欢喜。」

The Parable of the Lost Son
11 Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. 12 The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them. Was this an even distribution?)
13 “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country How would you describe the relationship between the father and the son before the son left? What did the father seem to realize? and there squandered his wealth in wild living. How would you describe the relationship between the father and the son before the son left? What did the father seem to realize? 14 After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. 15 So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, What had the son not yet realized? who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. 16 He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. What was happening to the son? How low did he sink through this degrading experience?
17 “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! What had the son at last realized physically? 18 I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. What had the son realized spiritually? Can you think of a word to describe the change in the son? Why was the son not afraid to return home? 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’ What is the son admitting by calling himself not worthy? What relationship did he lose and what does he deserve? 20 So he got up and went to his father.
“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. The father had never stopped loving his son and this love led him to embrace his son? How would you describe the son’s appearance from what we learned about him in the previous verses? What does this tell us about our Heavenly Father?
浪子的比喻
11 耶稣又说：「一个人有两个儿子。12 小儿子对父亲说：『父亲，请你把我应得的家业分给我。』他父亲就把产业分给他们。这样的分配公平吗？13 过了不多几日，小儿子就把他一切所有的都收拾起来，往远方去了。你会怎样形容小儿子未走之前的父子关系？父亲意识到了什么？在那里任意放荡，浪费资财。14 既耗尽了一切所有的，又遇着那地方大遭饥荒，就穷苦起来。15 于是去投靠那地方的一个人；这个儿子还没有明白什么？那人打发他到田里去放猪。16 他恨不得拿猪所吃的豆荚充饥，也没有人给他。这个儿子怎样了？他屈辱的生活堕落到什么地步？17 他醒悟过来，就说：『我父亲有多少的雇工，口粮有余，我倒在这里饿死吗？这个儿子最终在生活上意识到什么？18 我要起来，到我父亲那里去，向他说：父亲！我得罪了天，又得罪了你；这个儿子在灵里面意识到什么？你能用一个词来描述这个儿子的变化吗？为什么这个儿子不害怕回家？19 从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子，把我当作一个雇工吧！』这个儿子称自己不配的时候坦承了什么？他失去了什么关系并且应得的是什么？20 于是起来，往他父亲那里去。相离还远，他父亲看见，就动了慈心，跑去抱着他的颈项，连连与他亲嘴。这个父亲从未停止对儿子的爱并且这爱使他拥抱他的儿子。从前面数节来看，你会怎样描述这个儿子这时的外表？这教导了我们哪些关于天父的事？
Notes注释
Share of the estate – The father might divide the inheritance (double to the older son) but retain the income from it until his death. The older son was expected to stay at home to take care of the estate and his parents.
应得的家业– 这位父亲大概分配了财产（大儿子的两倍）但保留从财产中获得的收入直至去世。大儿子预计会留在家里照顾家产和父母。

Divided his property – It was customary for younger sons to receive their portion of the inheritance during their father’s lifetime. In many countries the parent could not legally refuse to comply with the request. It is not clear if this was customary in the Jewish tradition.
产业分给他们– 习俗是小儿子在他父亲在世的时候得到他们的那部分产业。在许多国家的法律都不允许拒绝这样的要求。不清楚在犹太传统里是否有这样的习俗。

Got together all he had – The son’s motive becomes apparent when he departs, taking with him all his possessions and leaving nothing behind to come back to. He wants to be free of parental restraint and to spend his share of the family wealth as he pleases.
把他一切所有的都收拾起来– 这个儿子走的时候显露了他的动机，把他所有的都带走并且什么都不留下再不回来。他想从父母的约束中离开并且随自己的心意花费他所分得的家产。

In need – He was at the point of starvation.
穷苦–他面临饥饿的时候

Feed pigs – The ultimate indignity for a Jew; not only was the work distasteful but pigs were ‘unclean’ animals.
放猪– 对犹太人的极大侮辱；不仅意味着是令人厌恶的工作，而且猪是不洁净的动物。

Pods – Seeds of the carob tree.
豆荚 - 角豆树的果实

No one gave him anything – The amount of food that he received was inadequate.
也没有人给他–他得不到足够的食物

Came to his senses – He realized the situation he was in; his pride was broken.
醒悟过来– 他意识到自己的处境；他的骄傲破碎了

Sinned against heaven and against you – He had willfully acted contrary to the will of God first, and then to his father.
得罪了天，又得罪了你– 他有意的行违背神的旨意的事又违背他父亲的意愿。

Part 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ What part of the confession did the father cut off? Why didn’t the father let the son finish?
22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. In Galatians 3:27 we read “for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed your selves with Christ. What does Christ put on us? Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. What do the ring and sandals signify? 23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. How is this verse like Luke 15:7 and10? 24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate. What does this tell us about the depth of God’s love?
25 “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. What do we learn about the older son? When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 27 ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ What response was the servant expecting from the older brother?
28 “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. Why would the older son behave this way? What does this tell us about the older son’s ability to forgive? So his father went out and pleaded with him. Why would the father plead with the son? What did he want the son to realize? 29 But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. What had the older son forgot to mention that he received from his father? Think-Probably the same things his younger brother had forgotten before he left. How did the older son describe his relationship with his father? How did the older son describe his relationship with his father? Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. What does the older son fail to forget in relation to his inheritance? Couldn’t the son have had a goat if he wanted one?30 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ Of what was the older son really accusing his father? What was the son unable to see?
31 “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’” Why was the celebration necessary? Why does Jesus not tell us if the older son finally came in to celebrate?
21 儿子说：『父亲！我得罪了天，又得罪了你；从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子。』这个父亲打断了儿子认罪的哪一部分？为什么父亲没有让儿子说完？22 父亲却吩咐仆人说：『把那上好的袍子快拿出来给他穿；在加拉太书3:27节我们读到“你们受洗归入基督的都是披戴基督了。”基督为我们穿上了什么？把戒指戴在他指头上；把鞋穿在他脚上；戒指和鞋意味着什么？23 把那肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝快乐；这节经文和路加福音15章7,10节有什么相似之处？24 因为我这个儿子是死而复活，失而又得的。』他们就快乐起来。这里是如何教导了我们关于神对我们的深爱的？25 那时，大儿子正在田里。我们对大儿子有哪些了解？他回来，离家不远，听见作乐跳舞的声音，26 便叫过一个仆人来，问是什么事。27 仆人说：『你兄弟来了；你父亲因为得他无灾无病地回来，把肥牛犊宰了。』仆人期望大儿子如何回应？28 大儿子却生气，不肯进去；为什么大儿子会这样？这里是如何告诉我们大儿子赦免的能力的？他父亲就出来劝他。为什么父亲要劝儿子他要让儿子明白什么？29 他对父亲说：『我服事你这多年，从来没有违背过你的命，你并没有给我一只山羊羔，叫我和朋友一同快乐。这个大儿子忘记提到了哪些他从父亲那里所得到的？大概和小儿子离开家前所忘记的事一样。大儿子是怎么描述他和父亲的关系的？30 但你这个儿子和娼妓吞尽了你的产业，他一来了，你倒为他宰了肥牛犊。』大儿子实际指责他父亲的是什么？这个儿子没能看到什么？31父亲对他说：『儿啊！你常和我同在，我一切所有的都是你的；32 只是你这个兄弟是死而复活、失而又得的，所以我们理当欢喜快乐。』」为什么一定要庆祝？为什么耶稣没有告诉我们大儿子最终是否参加了庆祝？

Notes注释
Best robe…ring…sandals…feast – Each was a sign of position and acceptance: a long robe was a sign of distinction, a signet ring of authority, sandals like a son (slaves went barefoot), and the fattened calf for a special occasion.
上好的袍子…戒指…鞋…吃喝快乐– 每一样都是地位和接纳的象征：长袍象征着荣誉，带印的戒指象征着权柄，穿上鞋就如儿子（奴仆是赤脚的），肥牛犊是为特殊场合预备的。

Dead and is alive – lost to all good; I have forgiven him.
死而复活– 失去了所有的善行；我已经赦免他了。

The older brother – The forgiving love of the father symbolizes the divine mercy of God. The older brother’s resentment is like the attitude of the Pharisees and teachers of the law who opposed Jesus.
大儿子– 父亲赦免的爱象征着神的恩慈。大儿子的怨恨就像抵挡耶稣的法利赛人和文士的态度一样。

Young goat – Cheaper food than a fattened calf.
山羊羔– 比肥牛犊廉价的食物。

This son of yours – The older brother would not even recognize his as his brother, so bitter was his hatred.
你这个儿子– 大儿子甚至不认他为自己的兄弟，他充满了怨恨的苦毒。

Everything I have is yours – The father shares all that he has and gives the older son unrestricted use of all his possessions.
我一切所有的都是你的– 父亲把一切他所有的与他分享并使他大儿子毫无限制的使用他所有的财产。

Lost and is found – These words are often used to mean ‘perished and saved.”
失而复得– 这些词语常常意指“灭亡和得救”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Thought – Each believing soul is precious to God. He cannot bear to see a single straying soul go to its spiritual death.
最后的思考– 每一个相信的人都是神所宝贵的。祂不忍看到任何一个谜途的人走向属灵的灭亡
