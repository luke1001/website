路加福音 Luke 21:1-38
Luke 21:1-38路加福音21：1-38
            Jesus continues His teaching in the temple on Tuesday of Passion Week.
           在受难周的星期二，耶稣继续祂在圣殿里的教导。

The Widow’s Offering寡妇的奉献
    1 As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury. 2 He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. What do we know about the widow? 3 “Truly I tell you,” he said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others. 4 All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.” What was the spirit of the widow's gift? Is Jesus telling us how much we should give back to Him? Explain your answer.
      1耶稣抬头观看，见财主把捐项投在库里，2又见一个穷寡妇投了两个小钱，关于寡妇我们都知道什么？3就说：「我实在告诉你们，这穷寡妇所投的比众人还多；4因为众人都是自己有余，拿出来投在捐项里，但这寡妇是自己不足，把她一切养生的都投上了。」寡妇奉献的实质是什么？耶稣是在告诉我们应该归还给祂多少吗？请解释你的答案。

Notes注释
Putting their gifts - All along the series of columns were containers into which the worshippers deposited their offerings. On each container there was a label which specified the object for which the offering was intended.
把捐项--- 殿里的柱子前面都放有奉献箱，前来敬拜的人们就把他们的奉献投入到箱内。每一个奉献箱上都有一个标注，上面注明了这个奉献箱里的奉献是给谁的（或“要做何而用的”）。
Very small copper coins - The coins were mites, the smallest coin used. It was worth less than a penny.
两个小钱 ---这小钱是非常微小的，价值最小的，还不值一分钱。

The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times预言圣殿被毁
            In the year 66 AD the Jews of Judea rebelled against their Roman masters. In response, the Emperor Nero dispatched an army under the generalship of Vespasian to restore order. By the year 68, resistance in the northern part of the province had been eradicated and the Romans turned their full attention to the subjugation of Jerusalem. That same year, the Emperor Nero died by his own hand, creating a power vacuum in Rome. In the resultant chaos, Vespasian was declared Emperor and returned to the Imperial City. It fell to his son, Titus, to lead the remaining army in the assault on Jerusalem.
           公元66年，犹太的犹太人发动暴乱反对当时他们的罗马统治者。作为回应，尼禄皇帝派出了由维斯帕先率领的军队来平定动乱。直到公元68年，北部的反抗势力已被消灭，罗马政府就把他们全部的精力放在了对耶路撒冷的镇压上。同年，尼禄死于自己的手中，这样罗马就出现了政权上的空档。就在这样的混乱中，维斯帕先自立为帝，并返回到帝国之城。他的儿子提图斯就接领了余下的军队，继续在耶路撒冷的镇压。
            The Roman legions surrounded the city and began to slowly squeeze the life out of the Jewish stronghold. By the year 70, the attackers had breached Jerusalem's outer walls and began a systematic ransacking of the city. The assault culminated in the burning and destruction of the Temple that served as the center of Judaism.
           罗马军队包围了耶路撒冷城，并开始慢慢地压榨着（消减）犹太要塞的生命力。到公元70年，罗马军队已经攻破了耶路撒冷的外墙并开始大规模的掠夺。犹太教的中心—圣殿--- 的烧毁也就是这侵略的高潮。
            In victory, the Romans slaughtered thousands. Of those sparred from death: thousands more were enslaved and sent to toil in the mines of Egypt, others were dispersed to arenas throughout the Empire to be butchered for the amusement of the public. The Temple's sacred relics were taken to Rome where they were displayed in celebration of the victory. It has been determined that 1,100,000 Jews were killed and 97,000 were taken prisoner by the Romans.
           在胜利中，罗马屠杀了成千上万的人。在那些逃过一死的人中，又有成千上万的人沦为奴隶被送到埃及的矿中做苦工，另外一些人被送到罗马的竞技场为了娱乐公众而遭受屠杀。圣殿里剩下的圣物被带到罗马展出以显示罗马的得胜。据估计，当时有110万犹太人被杀害，有9.7万被沦为罗马的监下囚。

    5 Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said, 6 “As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down.”What was Jesus predicting?
5有人谈论圣殿是用美石和供物妆饰的；6耶稣就说：「论到你们所看见的这一切，将来日子到了，在这里没有一块石头留在石头上，不被拆毁了。」耶稣在预言什么？

   7 “Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?” What were the disciples asking?
   8 He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them. For what do the disciples have to watch out? 9 When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.” What must happen?
   10 Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. What are some additional signs?
7他们问他说：「夫子！什么时候有这事呢？这事将到的时候有什么预兆呢？」门徒在问什么？8耶稣说：「你们要谨慎，不要受迷惑；因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：『我是基督』，又说：『时候近了』，你们不要跟从他们！门徒要谨慎防备什么？9你们听见打仗和扰乱的事，不要惊惶；因为这些事必须先有，只是末期不能立时就到。」将来必要有什么事情发生？10当时，耶稣对他们说：「民要攻打民，国要攻打国；11地要大大震动，多处必有饥荒、瘟疫，又有可怕的异象和大神迹从天上显现。还会有什么异象？
   12 “But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. 13 And so you will bear testimony to me. What will happen to the disciples? What will the disciples give? 14 But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. 15 For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. How does Jesus reassure the disciples? 16 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. What will happen to  some of the disciples? 17 Everyone will hate you because of me. 18 But not a hair of your head will perish. 19 Stand firm, and you will win life. Since some disciples will be put to death, what does Jesus mean when He says "But not a hair of your head will perish"?
12但这一切的事以先，人要下手拿住你们，逼迫你们，把你们交给会堂，并且收在监里，又为我的名拉你们到君王诸侯面前。13但这些事终必为你们的见证。会有什么事情发生在门徒身上？门徒们会给出什么？14所以，你们当立定心意，不要预先思想怎样分诉；15因为我必赐你们口才、智慧，是你们一切敌人所敌不住、驳不倒的。耶稣如何坚定门徒？16连你们的父母、弟兄、亲族、朋友也要把你们交官；你们也有被他们害死的。会有什么事情发生在一些门徒身上？17你们要为我的名被众人恨恶，18然而，你们连一根头发也必不损坏。19你们常存忍耐，就必保全灵魂34。」既然一些门徒会被害死，那么耶稣说“你们连一根头发也必不损坏”这指的是什么意思呢？
   20 “When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city. What advise does Jesus give when Jerusalem is being attacked? 22 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written. Why is Jerusalem being attacked? 23 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people. 24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. When will the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled?
20「你们看见耶路撒冷被兵围困，就可知道它成荒场的日子近了。21那时，在犹太的应当逃到山上；在城里的应当出来；在乡下的不要进城；在耶路撒冷被攻的时候要做什么，耶稣给了什么建议？22因为这是报应的日子，使经上所写的都得应验。为什么耶路撒冷会被攻？23当那些日子，怀孕的和奶孩子的有祸了！因为将有大灾难降在这地方，也有震怒临到这百姓。24他们要倒在刀下，又被掳到各国去。耶路撒冷要被外邦人践踏，直到外邦人的日期满了。」什么时候外邦人的日期满了？
   25 “There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 26 People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 27 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. What event is Jesus describing? Look at verse 26. How will unbelievers respond to such happenings? 28 When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” Why can believers lift up their heads?
25「日、月、星辰要显出异兆，地上的邦国也有困苦；因海中波浪的响声，就慌慌不定。26天势都要震动，人想起那将要临到世界的事，就都吓得魂不附体。27那时，他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀驾云降临。耶稣在描述什么事件？参见第26节，不信的人是如何了面对这些将要发生的事情的？28一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首，因为你们得赎的日子近了。」
   29 He told them this parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. 30 When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near. What is obvious when the fig tree sprouts lives? 31 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near. What can believers anticipate when they see the signs the Lord has described?
   32 “Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. What will be with us until the end?
   29–30耶稣又设比喻对他们说：「你们看无花果树和各样的树；它发芽的时候，你们一看见，自然晓得夏天近了。无花果树发芽说明了什么？31这样，你们看见这些事渐渐地成就，也该晓得　神的国近了。当信徒们看到神所描述的异象时，他们就可以期待到什么了？32我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。33天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。」什么要和我们同在直到末了？

34 “Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap. Why must the disciples be careful? 35 For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth. 36 Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.” Who will we stand before when the end comes?
   37 Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives, 38 and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple. What does Jesus' daily activity during the last days of His life before crucifixion tell us about Him?
34 「你们要谨慎，恐怕因贪食、醉酒，并今生的思虑累住你们的心，那日子就如同网罗忽然临到你们；门徒们为什么要谨慎？35 因为那日子要这样临到全地上一切居住的人。36 你们要时时警醒，常常祈求，使你们能逃避这一切要来的事，得以站立在人子面前。」末了的时候，我们要站立在谁面前？37 耶稣每日在殿里教训人，每夜出城在一座山，名叫橄榄山住宿。38 众百姓清早上圣殿，到耶稣那里，要听他讲道。从耶稣在钉十架前在祂在世的最后的日子里每日所做的，我们可以如何更认识耶稣？
