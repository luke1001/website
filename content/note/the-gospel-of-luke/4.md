路加福音 Luke 5:1-39

 The Calling of the First Disciples

 1One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God,  How would you describe the scene? 2he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. 3He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. How do verses 1-3 show practical wisdom? What do you think Jesus taught them?
5:1耶稣站在革尼撒勒湖边，众人拥挤他，要听神的道。你如何来描述当时的场景？5:2他见有两只船湾在湖边。打鱼的人却离开船，洗网去了。5:3有一只船，是西门的，耶稣就上去，请他把船撑开，稍微离岸，就坐下，从船上教训众人。在一至三节中体现了怎样的智慧？你认为耶稣给了他们怎样的教导？
 4When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch." Why do you think this was an unusual request?
 5Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets." How did Simon show he respected Jesus? 6When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.  How do verses 4-6 show Jesus knowledge? 7So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. How does verse 7 show Jesus generosity?  8When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!" How does verse 8 show Jesus holiness? 9For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 10and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men." How does verse 10 show Jesus is mission-minded? 11So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. What does it mean to leave everything? How was this fishing trip preparing Jesus disciples?
4 讲完了，对西门说：「把船开到水深之处，下网打鱼。」你认为这为什么是一个不寻常的要求？5 西门说：「夫子，我们整夜劳力，并没有打着什么。但依从你的话，我就下网。」西门如何表现出他尊重耶稣。6 他们下了网，就圈住许多鱼，网险些裂开，四至六节怎样说明了耶稣的知识？7 便招呼那只船上的同伴来帮助。他们就来，把鱼装满了两只船，甚至船要沉下去。第七节怎样显明了耶稣的慷慨？8 西门•彼得看见，就俯伏在耶稣膝前，说：「主啊，离开我，我是个罪人！」第八节怎样显明了耶稣的圣洁？9 他和一切同在的人都惊讶这一网所打的鱼。 10 他的伙伴西庇太的儿子雅各、约翰，也是这样。耶稣对西门说：「不要怕！从今以后，你要得人了。」第十节是怎样显明了耶稣的传福音意向？11 他们把两只船拢了岸，就撇下所有的，跟从了耶稣。撇下所有的意味着什么？这一次的打渔之旅怎样的预备了耶稣的门徒？

Notes注释
Gennesaret - Also called the Sea of Galilee located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem. Along the eastern and western sides the banks rise steep, bare, and rugged to a height of 1000 feet (304 meters) or more like a wall. At the time of Christ, the lake abounded in fish.
革尼撒勒-又名加利利海，坐落在耶路撒冷东北60英里（96公里）外。湖的东西两岸悬崖、峭壁高耸，约有1000英尺高（304米）好像城墙。在基督的时代，湖里盛产鱼类。
Washing their nets - After each period of fishing, the nets were washed, stretched and prepared for use again.
洗网-每次打渔以后，渔网要清洗、撑展以备下次使用。
Sat down - It was customary to stand while reading from the Scriptures but to sit while teaching.
坐下-传统上是站着读经，但坐下来教导。
Catch men - The disciples were to leave the fishing trade and to be instructed by Jesus in the Word of God, which they were to preach in all the world.
得人- 门徒们离弃了打渔的生意并开始受耶稣在神话语上的教导，这话语就是他们后来在全地所传讲的。

Left everything and followed him - This was not the first time these men had been with Jesus. At this time, they begin follow Jesus and become His disciples.
就撇下所有的，跟从了耶稣- 这不是这一群人头一次和耶稣在一起。从这时起他们开始跟从耶稣并开始成为他的门徒。

The Man With Leprosy
 12While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Why was this an unusual request? What did the man believe?
 13Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him. What type of healing was this? Did the healing depend on the man's faith?
 14Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."  Why would Jesus not want the man to tell anyone? What can we learn about Jesus? 15Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. 16But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. Why would Jesus withdraw to pray?
洁净长大麻风的人
12 有一回，耶稣在一个城里，有人满身长了大麻风，看见他，就俯伏在地，求他说：「主若肯，必能叫我洁净了。」为什么这是一个不寻常的要求？这个人相信什么？13 耶稣伸手摸他，说：「我肯，你洁净了吧！」大麻风立刻就离了他的身。这是怎样的医治？这次的医治取决于这个人的信心吗？ 14 耶稣嘱咐他：「你切不可告诉人，只要去把身体给祭司察看，又要为你得了洁净，照摩西所吩咐的献上礼物，对众人作证据。」耶稣为什么不愿意让这个人告诉任何人？我们可以从中对耶稣有怎样的认识？15 但耶稣的名声越发传扬出去。有极多的人聚集来听道，也指望医治他们的病。 16 耶稣却退到旷野去祷告。耶稣为什么要退去祷告？

Notes注释
Leprosy - The word leprosy was used indicate an infectiousness skin disease and not always true leprosy which ateaway the skin. People with skin diseases were outcasts and isolated from others.
大麻风- 大麻风这个词被用来特指具有传染性的皮肤病并不一定就是指侵蚀皮肤的麻风病。患有皮肤病的人往往被弃绝和他人隔离开来。
Show yourself to the priest - To supply ritual certification of cleansing so the man could be reinstated into society.
把身体给祭司看-当得到礼仪上的洁净的证明后这人才能恢复社会生活。

Jesus Heals a Paralytic
 17One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. From where did the Pharisees and teachers of the law come? And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick. 18Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. 19When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. Why do you think the crowds gathered at the home?  20When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven." What could Jesus tell greatly bothered the paralyzed man?
 21The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Why would the teacher’s of the law go to hear Jesus? With what were the teacher’s of the law concerned?Who can forgive sins but God alone?"  22Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Why didn’t the teachers of the law speak our loud? 23Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?  Which is easier? 24But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home." Jesus wanted the teacher’s of the law to know not only could he forgive sins but what else could Jesus do? 25Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. Describe the healing. What does this tell us about Jesus power?26Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today. What effect did Jesus' healing of the men have on the people?
治好瘫痪病人
17 有一天，耶稣教训人，有法利赛人和教法师在旁边坐着；他们是从加利利各乡村和犹太并耶路撒冷来的。法利赛人和教法师是从哪里来的？主的能力与耶稣同在，使他能医治病人。 18 有人用褥子抬着一个瘫子，要抬进去放在耶稣面前， 19 却因人多，寻不出法子抬进去，就上了房顶，从瓦间把他连褥子缒到当中，正在耶稣面前。你想为什么这群人会都聚集在屋子里？ 20 耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：「你的罪赦了。」耶稣看出来是什么大大地困扰着这个瘫痪的人？21 文士和法利赛人就议论说：「这说僭妄话的是谁？文士们为什么来听耶稣的话？这些文士关切着什么？除了　神以外，谁能赦罪呢？」 22 耶稣知道他们所议论的，就说：「你们心里议论的是什么呢？为什么这些教法师不大声说出来？23 或说『你的罪赦了』，或说『你起来行走』，哪一样容易呢？哪一样容易呢？24 但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。」就对瘫子说：「我吩咐你，起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！」Jesus wanted the teacher’s of the law to know not only could he forgive sins but what else could Jesus do? 耶稣要让教法师知道祂除了能赦罪还能做什么？25 那人当众人面前立刻起来，拿着他所躺卧的褥子回家去，归荣耀与　神。 26 众人都惊奇，也归荣耀与　神，并且满心惧怕，说：「我们今日看见非常的事了。」耶稣对这个人的医治对众人有怎样的果效？
Notes注释
Pharisees – They were teachers in the synagogues, religious examples in the eyes of the people and self-appointed guardians of the law and its proper observance. They considered the interpretations and regulations handed down by tradition to be virtually as authoritative as Scripture. They were a legalistic and separatist group who strictly, but often hypocritically, kept the law of Moses and the unwritten “tradition of the elders."
法利赛人- 他们是犹太会堂的教师，是众人眼中的宗教榜样，并且自认为是律法及正统行为的守护者。他们重视对传统对律法的解释和规条并视之与经文有同等的权威。他们是一群重视律法并分别出来的群体，严格的，但常常是假冒伪善的，遵守摩西的律法和不成为的“祖先的遗传”。
Teachers of the law – The Jewish scholars of the day, professionally trained in the development, teaching and application of the Old Testament law. Their authority was strictly human and traditional.
教法师- 当时的犹太学者，在发展，教导和应用旧约律法上受过专门的培训。他们的权柄是严谨的人和传统。
Paralytic- Nothing definite can be said about the nature of the man’s affliction beyond the fact that he could not walk. The determination of the men to reach Jesus suggests that his condition was desperate.
瘫子-再没有比他不能行走的事实更清楚的说明这个人所遭受的困苦情形了。这人来到耶稣面前的决心说明他不顾一切的情形。
Roof­ – A typical Palestinian house had a flat roof accessible by means of an outside staircase. The roof was often made of a thick layer of clay (packed with a stone roller), supported by mats of branches across wood beams.
房顶-典型的巴勒斯坦房屋都有平顶可以藉外面的楼梯登上。屋顶通常是一层厚重的粘土（用石碾压实），由木质横梁所支撑的垫来支撑。
Blaspheming – Speaking evil about God. In Jewish theology even the Messiah could not forgive sins, and Jesus’ forgiveness of sin was a claim to deity-which they considered to be blasphemous. According to Jewish law, a person guilty of blasphemy was to be stoned to death.
僭妄- 对神说罪恶的话。在犹太神学里即便弥赛亚也没不能赦免罪，耶稣的赦罪是宣称自己的神性-他们因此认定这是僭妄。根据犹太律法，犯了僭妄罪的人要被处于石刑。
Your sins are forgiven - Jesus first met the man’s deepest need: forgiveness.
你的罪赦了- 耶稣先触及这个人最深的需要：赦免。
The Calling of Levi
 27After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him, 28and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. What did it mean for Matthew to follow the call of Jesus?
 29Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. What does Levi's behavior teach us about the life-changing power of Jesus? 30But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and 'sinners'?" Why complain to the disciples?  31Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 32I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." What does Jesus' description of Himself as a spiritual Doctor teach about His relationship to sinful people?
呼召利未
27 这事以后，耶稣出去，看见一个税吏，名叫利未，坐在税关上，就对他说：「你跟从我来。」 28 他就撇下所有的，起来，跟从了耶稣。马太（利未）跟从了耶稣的呼召意味着什么？29 利未在自己家里为耶稣大摆筵席，有许多税吏和别人与他们一同坐席。利未的行为在耶稣改变生命的能力方面对我们有怎样的教导？ 30 法利赛人和文士就向耶稣的门徒发怨言说：「你们为什么和税吏并罪人一同吃喝呢？」为什么向门徒们发怨言？ 31 耶稣对他们说：「无病的人用不着医生；有病的人才用得着。 32 我来本不是召义人悔改，乃是召罪人悔改。」耶稣描述自己为属灵的医生说明了他和罪人的关系是怎样的？

Notes注释
Tax collector - Taxes were collected for the Roman government by Jewish agents, who were especially detested for helping these non-religious conquerors and for frequently defrauding their own people.
税吏- 犹太代理人为罗马政府收税，他们因帮助不信神的入侵者和常常欺诈同胞而遭唾弃。

Jesus Questioned About Fasting
 33They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking." How were John the Baptist disciples compared to Jesus disciples?  34Jesus answered, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? 35But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast." What is the meaning of Jesus' explanation when asked why His disciples did not fast more frequently?
 36He told them this parable: "No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old. 37And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. 38No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. 39And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, 'The old is better.' " What were the Pharisees reluctant to change?
禁食的问题
33 他们说：「约翰的门徒屡次禁食祈祷，法利赛人的门徒也是这样；惟独你的门徒又吃又喝。」施洗约翰的门徒和耶稣的门徒有什么不同？ 34 耶稣对他们说：「新郎和陪伴之人同在的时候，岂能叫陪伴之人禁食呢？ 35 但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那日他们就要禁食了。」耶稣对他的门徒为什么不常常禁食的回答是什么意思？ 36 耶稣又设一个比喻，对他们说：「没有人把新衣服撕下一块来补在旧衣服上；若是这样，就把新的撕破了，并且所撕下来的那块新的和旧的也不相称。 37 也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；若是这样，新酒必将皮袋裂开，酒便漏出来，皮袋也就坏了。 38 但新酒必须装在新皮袋里。 39 没有人喝了陈酒又想喝新的；他总说陈的好。」什么是法利赛人不愿意改变的？

Notes注释
Fast - God had specifically commanded only one annual fast for the people of Israel, a fast on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). Later on, people fasted on other occasions of their own choosing. Often the practice was not carried out in the spirit of love for God and man.
禁食- 神仅仅特别命令以色列人每年一度的禁食，即每年赎罪日（犹太赎罪日）的禁食。后来，人们在自己选择的场合也禁食。而这些做法却常常没有行在爱神和爱人的心意中。
New wine - This refers to the Gospel
新酒-这里指代福音
New wine will burst the skins - New wine is still fermenting (expanding)
新酒必将皮袋裂开-新酒会继续发酵（膨胀）
