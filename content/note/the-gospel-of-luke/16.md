路加福音 Luke 17:1-37
Luke 17:1-37
路加福音17章:1-37节
         Jesus did not take the direct route to Jerusalem, but traveled back and forth in Southern Galilee and into Samaria. The chapter begins with Jesus talking to his disciples. The disciples need to guard the faith of others and never tire of forgiving  others.
耶稣并没有选择直接到耶路撒冷的路线，而是在南加利利到撒玛利亚的境内辗转旅行。这一章开始于耶稣对祂的门徒谈话。门徒们需要看顾他人的信心并且饶恕他人永不厌烦。
Sin, Faith, Duty
 1 Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come. What will bring woe to people? What does it mean to stumble?  2 It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. 3 So watch yourselves.
   “If your brother or sistersins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. What is Jesus asking of us? 4 Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.” What kind of love does Jesus ask of His disciples?
 5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”What did the disciples realize  they lacked?
 6 He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you. What is meant by Jesus encouraging reply?
   7 “Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit down to eat’? What is expected from a servant? 8 Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’? Describe a servant's life.9 Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? 10 So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’” What should our response be as Christ's servants?
罪，信心，仆人的本分
1 耶稣又对门徒说：「绊倒人的事是免不了的；但那绊倒人的有祸了。什么会带给人祸患？绊倒人是什么意思？2 就是把磨石拴在这人的颈项上，丢在海里，还强如他把这小子里的一个绊倒了。3 你们要谨慎！若是你的弟兄得罪你，就劝戒他；他若懊悔，就饶恕他。耶稣要求我们什么？4 倘若他一天七次得罪你，又七次回转，说：『我懊悔了』，你总要饶恕他。」耶稣要祂的门徒有怎样的爱？
5 使徒对主说：「求主加增我们的信心。」门徒意识到他们缺乏什么？6 主说：「你们若有信心像一粒芥菜种，就是对这棵桑树说：『你要拔起根来，栽在海里』，它也必听从你们。耶稣鼓励的回应是什么意思？7 你们谁有仆人耕地或是放羊，从田里回来，就对他说：『你快来坐下吃饭』呢？仆人被期望做什么？8 岂不对他说：『你给我预备晚饭，束上带子伺候我，等我吃喝完了，你才可以吃喝』吗？描述一个仆人的生活？9 仆人照所吩咐的去做，主人还谢谢他吗？10 这样，你们做完了一切所吩咐的，只当说：『我们是无用的仆人，所做的本是我们应分做的。』」我们作为基督的仆人当有怎样的本分？

Jesus Heals Ten Men With Leprosy
 11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 12 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance 13 and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” Why did the lepers stand at a distance? What did the lepers ask of Jesus? What didn't they ask? 14 When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed. Did the lepers hesitate? What happened?15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. What had only one of the lepers realized? 16 He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan. How close to Jesus did the Samaritan get?
 17 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? What did attitude did Jesus express? Why? 18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?” What is the significance of Luke's mention that the thankful man was a Samaritan?
19 Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.” Did the Samaritan's faith heal him? What did the Samaritan believe?
治好十个长大麻风的
11 耶稣往耶路撒冷去，经过撒马利亚和加利利。12 进入一个村子，有十个长大麻风的，迎面而来，远远地站着，13 高声说：「耶稣，夫子，可怜我们吧！」为什么这些麻风病人远远地站着？他们向耶稣求什么？他们没有要求什么？14 耶稣看见，就对他们说：「你们去把身体给祭司察看。」他们去的时候就洁净了。这些麻风病人犹豫了吗？结果怎样？ 15 内中有一个见自己已经好了，就回来大声归荣耀与　神，这唯一的麻风病人明白了什么？16又俯伏在耶稣脚前感谢他；这人是撒马利亚人。这个撒玛利亚人和耶稣有多挨近？17 耶稣说：「洁净了的不是十个人吗？那九个在哪里呢？耶稣表现出怎样的看法？为什么？18 除了这外族人，再没有别人回来归荣耀与　神吗？」路加在这里提到这个感谢的人是撒玛利亚人的重要意义什么？19 就对那人说：「起来，走吧！你的信救了你了。」是撒玛利亚人的信心医治了他吗？这个撒玛利亚人相信什么？

Notes
Leprosy - Leprosy was a highly infectious disease. Those who had leprosy were banished from town and lived in isolation. Leper's were considered unclean and could not return to society. There was no known cure.
注释
大麻风 - 大麻风是一种极易传染的疾病。那些患大麻风的人被从市镇中驱逐出来，生活在隔离的环境中。大麻风病人是不洁净的并且不准许回到社会中，将没有机会得医治。

The Coming of the Kingdom of God
 20 Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come,  What kind of kingdom did the Pharisees want? Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, 21 nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.” Explain Jesus reply.
 22 Then he said to his disciples, “The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. What is Jesus pointing out to His disciples? 23 People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them. What should the disciples realize?24 For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. What will Jesus return be like? 25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. What must happen?
   26 “Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. 27 People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. What happened in the days of Noah?Why were they destroyed?
   28 “It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. 29 But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. What happened in the days of Lot?Why were they destroyed?
   30 “It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. 31 On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Why would people be on the housetop? What will they not be able to save? Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. 32 Remember Lot’s wife! 33 Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it. What will some people try to keep? How will others keep their life?34 I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. 35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.” [36]  What will decide who is taken and who is left?
 37 “Where, Lord?” they asked. What are the disciples asking?
   He replied, “Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.” What is Jesus telling us about the final judgment?

[36]  Some manuscripts add verse 36. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
神国的来到
20 法利赛人问：「　神的国几时来到？」法利赛人盼望想要什么样的国度？耶稣回答说：「　神的国来到不是眼所能见的。21 人也不得说：『看哪，在这里！看哪，在那里！』因为　神的国就在你们心里。」请解释耶稣的回应。22 他又对门徒说：「日子将到，你们巴不得看见人子的一个日子，却不得看见。耶稣向祂的门徒指明什么？ 23 人将要对你们说：『看哪，在那里！看哪，在这里！』你们不要出去，也不要跟随他们！门徒当要明白什么？ 24 因为人子在他降临的日子，好像闪电从天这边一闪直照到天那边。耶稣再次降临会是怎样的？25 只是他必须先受许多苦，又被这世代弃绝。什么事一定会发生？
26 挪亚的日子怎样，人子的日子也要怎样。27那时候的人又吃又喝，又娶又嫁，到挪亚进方舟的那日，洪水就来，把他们全都灭了。挪亚的日子发生了什么？他们为什么被毁灭？
28 又好像罗得的日子；人又吃又喝，又买又卖，又耕种又盖造。29 到罗得出所多玛的那日，就有火与硫磺从天上降下来，把他们全都灭了。罗得的日子发生了什么？他们为什么被毁灭？
30 人子显现的日子也要这样。31 当那日，人在房上，器具在屋里，不要下来拿；人们为什么会在房上？他们不能够抢救什么？ 人在田里，也不要回家。32 你们要回想罗得的妻子。33 凡想要保全生命的，必丧掉生命；凡丧掉生命的，必救活生命。有些人要保全什么？另一些人要怎样保全生命？ 34 我对你们说，当那一夜，两个人在一个床上，要取去一个，撇下一个。35 两个女人一同推磨，要取去一个，撇下一个。什么决定了谁被取去谁被撇下？[36] 37 门徒说：「主啊，在哪里有这事呢？」门徒们在问什么？耶稣说：「尸首在哪里，鹰也必聚在那里。」耶稣告诉了我们哪些关于末日审判的事？
[36] 有古卷加：36 两个人在田里，要取去一个，撇下一个。
