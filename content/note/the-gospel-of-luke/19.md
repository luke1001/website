Luke 20:1-47
路加福音 20：1-47
            The events in this chapter all occur on Tuesday of Passion Week.
           这一章里所记载的事件都发生在耶稣受难周的星期二。

The Authority of Jesus Questioned耶稣的权柄受到质疑
1 One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. What does Jesus continue to show towards the people? 2 “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?” What were the chief priests and the teachers of the law challenging?
20:1  有一天耶稣在殿里教训百姓，讲福音的时候，祭司长和文士并长老上前来，耶稣还在继续向世人说明什么？ 20:2  问他说，你告诉我们，你仗着什么权柄作这些事？给你这权柄的是谁呢？祭司长和文士在质疑什么？

   3 He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me: 4 John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?” What do you remember about John the Baptist?
   5 They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 6 But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”
   7 So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” Why couldn't the chief priests and the teachers of the law answer the question?
   8 Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.” Why wouldn't Jesus answer them?
  20:3  耶稣回答说，我也要问你们一句话。你们且告诉我。 20:4  约翰的洗礼，是从天上来的？是从人间来的呢？关于施洗约翰，你还记得什么？20:5  他们彼此商议说，我们若说从天上来，他必说你们为什么不信他呢？ 20:6  若说从人间来，百姓都要用石头打死我们。因为他们信约翰是先知。 20:7  于是回答说，不知道是从哪里来的。为什么祭司长和文士不能回答这个问题？ 20:8  耶稣说，我也不告诉你们，我仗着什么权柄作这些事。耶稣为什么不回答他们的问题？

The Parable of the Tenants园户的比喻
    9 He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time. 10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. 12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. Identify the following people in the parable: the owner -
the owner's son -                the owner's servants -                  the tenants -
What is the vineyard?                              What is the fruit?
  20:9  耶稣就设比喻，对百姓说，有人栽了一个葡萄园，租给园户，就往外国去住了许久。 20:10  到了时候，打发一个仆人到园户那里去，叫他们把园中当纳的果子交给他。园户竟打了他，叫他空手回去。 20:11  又打发一个仆人去。他们也打了他，并且凌辱他，叫他空手回去。 20:12  又打发第三个仆人去。他们也打伤了他，把他推出去了。
请指出以下在比喻中出现的人分别指向的是谁：葡萄园主---
园主的儿子----                       园主的仆人----             园户---
葡萄园指的是什么？果子是什么？
   13 “Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’ How does the owner treat the tenants?
   14 “But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What did the tenants want? Explain the tenants attitude toward the Son?
   “What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” What is Jesus telling the people in the temple?
   When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!” What had some of the people understood?
20:13  园主说，我怎么办呢？我要打发我的爱子去。或者他们尊敬他。园主是如何对待园户的？ 20:14  不料，园户看见他，就彼此商量说，这是承受产业的。我们杀他吧，使产业归于我们。 20:15  于是把他推出葡萄园外杀了。园户想要得到什么？请描述一下园户对园主儿子的态度？这样，葡萄园的主人，要怎样处治他们呢？ 20:16  他要来除灭这些园户，将葡萄园转给别人。耶稣是在给圣殿里的人们什么信息？听见的人说，这是万不可的。有些人是如何理解（耶稣的信息的）？
   17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:
   “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’? Who is the stone the builders rejected? What is a cornerstone?
   18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.” What does it mean to fall on that stone?
   19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. Why were the teachers of the law and the chief priests afraid of the people?
   20:17  耶稣看着他们说，经上记着，匠人所弃的石头，已作了房角的头块石头。这是什么意思呢？匠人所弃的石头指的是谁？房角石是什么？20:18  凡掉在那石头上的，必要跌碎。那石头掉在谁的身上，就要把谁砸得稀烂。掉在那石头上指的是什么意思？ 20:19  文士和祭司长，看出这比喻是指着他们说的，当时就想要下手拿他。只是惧怕百姓。文士和祭司长为什么害怕百姓？

Paying Taxes to Caesar纳税给该撒
    20 Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. Who did not go to talk with Jesus? They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. What is the plan? 21 So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. How did the imposters present themselves? 22 Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” Why is this a tricky question?
   20:20  于是窥探耶稣，打发奸细装作好人，谁没有去与耶稣谈话？要在他的话上得把柄，好将他交在巡抚的政权之下。他们有什么样的计划？ 20:21  奸细就问耶稣说，夫子，我们晓得你所讲所传都是正道，也不取人的外貌，乃是诚诚实实传神的道。奸细是如何表现自己的？ 20:22  我们纳税给该撒，可以不可以。这为什么是一个难回答的问题？
  23 He saw through their duplicity and said to them, 24 “Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”
   “Caesar’s,” they replied.
   25 He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” What does Jesus teach opponents who attempt to say you can not obey government and God?
   26 They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. Once again what was the plan?
   20:23  耶稣看出他们的诡诈，就对他们说， 20:24  拿一个银钱来给我看。这像和这号是谁的。他们说，是该撒的。 20:25  耶稣说，这样，该撒的物当归给该撒，神的物当归给神。对于那些企图说“你不能既顺服掌权者又顺服神”的人，耶稣是如何教导他们的？ 20:26  他们当着百姓，在这话上得不着把柄。又希奇他的应对，就闭口无言了。再一次他们的计划是什么？

Notes注释
Taxes - This tax was the annual tax collected by the tax collectors for the treasury of the Roman emperor.
税 --- 这税是由税吏为罗马帝王的国库所收的年税。

银钱 ---- 一个小银币相当于一天的工钱。罗马钱币上一般都印有但是当政的帝王的头像和封号。

The Resurrection and Marriage复活与嫁娶
27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. 28 “Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. 29 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. 30 The second 31 and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. 32 Finally, the woman died too. 33 Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” What problem do the Sadducees present for Jesus to solve?
20:27  撒都该人常说没有复活的事。有几个来问耶稣说， 20:28  夫子，摩西为我们写着说，人若有妻无子就死了，他兄弟当娶他的妻，为哥哥生子立后。 20:29  有弟兄七人。第一个娶了妻，没有孩子死了。 20:30  第二个，第三个，也娶过她。 20:31  那七个人，都娶过她，没有留下孩子就死了。 20:32  后来妇人也死了。 20:33  这样当复活的时候，她是哪一个的妻子呢？因为他们七个人都娶过她。撒都该人给耶稣提了一个什么样的难题要祂来解决？
   34 Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. 35 But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, 36 and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection. What do we learn about the resurrection? 37 But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ 38 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.” What do you remember about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?
   39 Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” 40 And no one dared to ask him any more questions. Why did no one dare ask Jesus anymore questions?
20:34  耶稣说，这世界的人，有娶有嫁。 20:35  惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁。 20:36  因为他们不能再死。和天使一样。既是复活的人，就为神的儿子。从这几节经文中，有关复活我们都学到了什么？20:37  至于死人复活，摩西在荆棘篇上，称主是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，就指示明白了。 20:38  神原不是死人的神，乃是活人的神。因为在他那里，人都是活的。关于亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各，你都还记得什么？（那里或作看来） 20:39  有几个文士说，夫子，你说得好。20:40  以 后 他 们 不 敢 再 问 他 什 么 。为什么没有人再敢问耶稣问题了？

Notes注释
Sadducees - They were a wealthy politically minded group who were willing to compromise with secular teachings. They controlled the high priesthood at this time and held the majority of the seats in the Sanhedrin. They did not believe in the resurrection, an afterlife, or angels.
撒都该人 --- 他们是一群富有的有政治头脑的人，也愿意妥协于世俗的教导。他们控制着当时的大祭司，并占据着犹太人最高法庭的多数席位。他们不相信复活，来世或是天使。

            The Sanhedrin was the highest court for the Jews. The members would        hear trials about heresy, idolatry, and false prophets. It could make arrests           of its own authority. It could not execute the death sentence.
Sanhedrin是犹太人的最高法庭。成员会听审涉及异端，拜偶像和假先知的案子。最高法庭自己有权来逮捕犯人。但他不能执行死刑。

Account of the burning bush - Exodus 3:1-2, 5-6 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up..."Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
荆棘篇---- 出埃及记3：1-2，5-6. 3:1  摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群，一日领羊群往野外去，到了神的山，就是何烈山。 3:2  耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。3:5  神说，不要近前来。当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地。 3:6  又说，我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。摩 西 蒙 上 脸 ， 因 为 怕 看 神 。

Whose Son Is the Messiah?谁的儿子是弥赛亚？
    41 Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? How is Jesus the son of David? 42 David himself declares in the Book of Psalms:
   “‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand 43 until I make your enemies
   a footstool for your feet.”’ What kind of king is Jesus?
   44 David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” What does
David mean when he calls the Messiah his Lord?
20:41  耶稣对他们说，人怎么说基督是大卫的子孙呢？耶稣如何是大卫的子孙？ 20:42  诗篇上，大卫自己说，主对我主说，你坐在我的右边， 20:43  等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。耶稣是什么样的君王？ 20:44  大卫既称他为主，他怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？当大卫称弥赛亚为他的主时，他指的是什么意思？


Warning Against the Teachers of the Law防备文士的警告
    45 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 46 “Beware of the teachers of the law. Whom should the disciples be aware? They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. How do the teachers of the law behave? 47 They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.” What is the purpose behind the sharp condemnation of the practices of the influential teachers of the law?
20:45  众百姓听的时候，耶稣对门徒说， 20:46  你们要防备文士。门徒们要防备谁？他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们安，又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座。文士的行为举止如何？20:47  他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚。对这些有影响力的文士的做法，耶稣给出了尖锐的咒诅，这咒诅背后的意图是什么呢？
