路加福音 Luke 14:1-35
Luke 14:1-35
路加福音14章:1-35节
            The Pharisees continued to attempt to provoke Jesus. It was for this reason, that Jesus was invited, as once before (see Luke 7:36), to dine with a prominent Pharisee. His host was one of the chief among the Pharisees, occupying a position of honor among them. In the house of the Pharisee Jesus was a guest; for feasting on the Sabbath was common among the Jews, though they were permitted to serve only cold dishes. The Pharisees thought they had arranged a trap for Jesus, by also inviting a man who had dropsy, an abnormal swelling of his body.
法利赛人继续尝试挑衅耶稣。正因为此，耶稣像上次一样(路加福音7:36节)被邀请和一个有名的法利赛人吃饭。主人是一个法利赛人的领袖，在他们中间拥有一个尊贵的头衔。在这个法利赛人的家里，耶稣是一个被邀的客人；安息日的筵席是犹太人的习俗，但他们只能准备冷盘。法利赛人以为他们又为耶稣设计了一个陷阱，就是也邀请了一个患水臌的人，他的身体有不正常的肿胀。

Jesus at a Pharisee’s House耶稣在法利赛人的家中
 1 One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. 2 There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. 3 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”What was Jesus able to read? 4 But they remained silent. Why would the Pharisees remain silent? So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way. By healing the man, what law did Jesus fulfill?
 5 Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?” 6 And they had nothing to say. Again, why would the Pharisees remain silent?
 7 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, What did many of the Pharisees think about themselves? he told them this parable: 8 “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. 9 If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. 10 But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests. 11 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” What is Jesus trying to teach the Pharisees by this parable?
 12 Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid. To whom is Jesus speaking? What type of invitation is commonly given? 13 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, 14 and you will be blessed. What types of people did Jesus associate with? How can those who have plenty show true generosity? Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.” When will you be repaid?

1安息日，耶稣到一个法利赛人的首领家里去吃饭，他们就窥探他。2在他面前有一个患水臌的人。3耶稣对律法师和法利赛人说：「安息日治病可以不可以？」4他们却不言语。耶稣就治好那人，叫他走了；5便对他们说：「你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉它上来呢？」6他们不能对答这话。为什么这些法利赛人不言语呢？7耶稣见所请的客拣择首位，大多数法利赛人都是怎么看待自己的？就用比喻对他们说：8「你被人请去赴婚姻的筵席，不要坐在首位上，恐怕有比你尊贵的客被他请来；9那请你们的人前来对你说：『让座给这一位吧！』你就羞羞惭惭地退到末位上去了。10你被请的时候，就去坐在末位上，好叫那请你的人来对你说：『朋友，请上座。』那时，你在同席的人面前就有光彩了。11因为，凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。」耶稣要用这个比喻教导这些法利赛人什么？12耶稣又对请他的人说：「你摆设午饭或晚饭，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属，和富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也请你，你就得了报答。耶稣在向谁说话？通常会是怎样的邀请？13你摆设筵席，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了！耶稣是和怎样的人来往？富足的人怎样才能显出真正的慷慨？14因为他们没有什么可报答你。到义人复活的时候，你要得着报答。」你将何时得到报偿？


Notes注释
Places of honor at the table - The Jews reclined on couches at the table. These couches held three or more people. The choice places were those at the left end of each couch, because the guests in those places had the best view of the host and the other guests. The practice of "scrambling" for these places of honor was not uncommon.
拣择首位– 犹太人斜靠在桌旁的卧榻上。每个卧榻有三个人或更多。通常人们拣选每个卧榻靠左边的位置，因为坐在这个位子上能更好的看到主人和其他客人。人们常因拣选首位而产生混乱。

The Parable of the Great Banquet大筵席的比喻
 15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.” What is the "feast in the kingdom of God"?
 16 Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. Who was invited to the banquet? 17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ What was the servant to tell the guests?
   18 “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’ What excuse was made?
   19 “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’ What excuse was made?
   20 “Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’ What excuse was made?
   21 “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’ What happened when the master heard the excuses? Who did the master invite?
   22 “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’ Who was invited?
   23 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. What does the master want? 24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’”
Who was the man who prepared the banquet? Who is the servant? Who were the people who rejected the invitation? What do you think is the real reason the invitation was rejected? Who accepted the invitation? Who will not share in the banquet?

15同席的有一人听见这话，就对耶稣说：「在　神国里吃饭的有福了！」“神国里吃饭” 是什么意思？16耶稣对他说：「有一人摆设大筵席，请了许多客。是谁被邀请赴宴？17到了坐席的时候，打发仆人去对所请的人说：『请来吧！样样都齐备了。』仆人告诉客人们什么？18 众人一口同音地推辞。头一个说：『我买了一块地，必须去看看。请你准我辞了。』以什么借口推辞的？19 又有一个说：『我买了五对牛，要去试一试。请你准我辞了。』以什么借口推辞的？20又有一个说：『我才娶了妻，所以不能去。』以什么借口推辞的？21那仆人回来，把这事都告诉了主人。家主就动怒，对仆人说：『快出去，到城里大街小巷，领那贫穷的、残废的、瞎眼的、瘸腿的来。』当主人听见这些借口的时候发生了什么？主人邀请了谁？22 仆人说：『主啊，你所吩咐的已经办了，还有空座。』谁被邀请？23 主人对仆人说：『你出去到路上和篱笆那里，勉强人进来，坐满我的屋子。主人希望怎样？24 我告诉你们，先前所请的人没有一个得尝我的筵席。』」
是谁预备了筵席？谁是仆人？是谁拒绝了邀请？你认为拒绝邀请的真实原因是什么？谁接受了邀请？谁将不能得享筵席？

The Cost of Being a Disciple做门徒的代价
 25 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: 26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple. Is Jesus encouraging strife between members of a family? What is the cost of discipleship? Why did Jesus want those who were following Him to know this? 27 And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. What does a cross symbolize?

   28 “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? 29 For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, 30 saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ What does Jesus warn us against in the parable of the "Foolish Builder?" What is the cost of following Jesus?
   31 “Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 32 If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. 33 What wise course of action does Jesus recommend? In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. What did Jesus give up for us? What should we give up for Jesus?
   34 “Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? For what was salt used? . If Christians no longer preach Christ, then what is their purpose? 35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out.
What is Jesus telling us when He warns about salt losing its saltiness?
   “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
25有极多的人和耶稣同行。他转过来对他们说：26「人到我这里来，若不爱我胜过爱自己的父 母、妻子、儿女、弟兄、姊妹，和自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒。耶稣是在鼓励家人之间有矛盾吗？做门徒要有怎样的代价？为什么耶稣想让跟从祂的人知道这些？27凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒。十字架象征着什么？28你们哪一个要盖一座楼，不先坐下算计花费，能盖成不能呢？29恐怕安了地基，不能成功，看见的人都笑话他，说：30『这个人开了工，却不能完工。』在“愚昧的建造者”比喻中，耶稣提醒我们要抵挡什么？跟随耶稣的代价是什么？31或是一个王出去和别的王打仗，岂不先坐下酌量，能用一万兵去敌那领二万兵来攻打他的吗？32若是不能，就趁敌人还远的时候，派使者去求和息的条款。耶稣劝人有怎样的智慧行动？33这样，你们无论什么人，若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的门徒。」耶稣为我们舍弃了什么？我们当为耶稣舍弃什么？34 「盐本是好的；盐若失了味，可用什么叫它再咸呢？盐是做什么用的？如果基督徒不再传讲基督，那么他们的目的将是什么？35 或用在田里，或堆在粪里，都不合式，只好丢在外面。当耶稣讲盐失了味的警告是要告诉我们什么？有耳可听的，就应当听！」
