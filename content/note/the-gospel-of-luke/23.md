Jesus Has Risen耶稣复活
1 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. What day of the week is this? What time of day? 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, How is the stone’s position different from Friday when it was rolled into place? 3 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. Who were these men? 5 In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, Name a few reasons why would the women be afraid. but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? 6 He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 7 ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ” 8 Then they remembered his words. Read Luke 9:22.
24:1  七日的头一日，黎明的时候，那些妇女带着所预备的香料，来到坟墓前。这天是星期几？这时是一天里的什么时候？ 24:2  看见石头已经从坟墓滚开了。这时石头的位置与星期五被滚入的位置有什么不同？ 24:3  她们就进去，只是不见主耶稣的身体。 24:4  正在猜疑之间，忽然有两个人站在旁边。衣服放光。这些人是谁？ 24:5  妇女们惊怕，将脸伏地。请举出几个妇女们惊怕的原因。那两个人就对她们说，为什么在死人中找活人呢？ 24:6  他不在这里，已经复活了。当记念他还在加利利的时候，怎样告诉你们， 24:7  说，人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。 24:8  她们就想起耶稣的话来，阅读路加福音9：22

   9 When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. Who are the others? 10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. 11 But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. What did the disciples not yet believe? 12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
24:9  便从坟墓那里回去，把这一切事告诉十一个使徒和其余的人。这其余的人指的是谁？ 24:10  那告诉使徒的，就是抹大拉的马利亚，和约亚拿，并雅各的母亲马利亚，还有与她们在一处的妇女。 24:11  她们这些话，使徒以为是胡言，就不相信。门徒还没有相信什么？ 24:12  彼得起来，跑到坟墓前，低头往里看，见细麻布独在一处，就回去了，心里希奇所成的事。

On the Road to Emmaus以马忤斯的路上
13 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven milesfrom Jerusalem. 14 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. What event are talking to each other about? 15 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; 16 but they were kept from recognizing him. Who kept the two men from recognizing Jesus?
24:13  正当那日，门徒中有两个人往一个村子去，这村子名叫以马忤斯，离耶路撒冷约有二十五里。 24:14  他们彼此谈论所遇见的这一切事。他们彼此在谈论什么事情？ 24:15  正谈论相问的时候，耶稣亲自就近他们，和他们同行。 24:16  只是他们的眼睛迷糊了，不认识他。谁使这两个人不能认出耶稣？
   17 He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?”
   They stood still, their faces downcast. What does downcast mean? 18 One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
   19 “What things?” he asked.
   “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. What did the men not believe? How did they describe Jesus? 20 The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; 21 but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. What kind of king were they hoping for? And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. 22 In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning 23 but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. What evidence that Jesus was alive did the men ignore? 24 Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”
24:17  耶稣对他们说，你们走路彼此谈论的是什么事呢？他们就站住，脸上带着愁容。愁容指的是什么意思？ 24:18  二人中有一个名叫革流巴的，回答说，你在耶路撒冷作客，还不知道这几天在那里所出的事吗？ 24:19  耶稣说，什么事呢？他们说，就是拿撒勒人耶稣的事。他是个先知，在神和众百姓面前，说话行事都有大能。他们不相信什么？他们如何来描述耶稣？ 24:20  祭司长和我们的官府，竟把他解去定了死罪，钉在十字架上。 24:21  但我们素来所盼望要赎以色列民的就是他。他们所期盼的是什么样的君王？不但如此，而且这事成就，现在已经三天了。 24:22  再者，我们中间有几个妇女使我们惊奇，她们清早到了坟墓那里。 24:23  不见他的身体，就回来告诉我们说，看见了天使显现，说他活了。有什么可以证明耶稣已复活的事实他们忽视了？ 24:24  又有我们的几个人，往坟墓那里去，所遇见的，正如妇女们所说的，只是没有看见他。
   25 He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Why does Jesus rebuke them? 26 Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. How did Jesus show His love towards these two men?
24:25  耶稣对他们说，无知的人哪，先知所说的一切话，你们的心，信得太迟钝了。耶稣为什么斥责他们？ 24:26  基督这样受害，又进入他的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？ 24:27  于是从摩西和众先知起，凡经上所指着自己的话，都给他们讲解明白了。耶稣是如何来向这两个人彰显他的爱的？
   28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 29 But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. Why would the men want Jesus to stay with them?
24:28  将近他们所去的村子，耶稣好像还要往前行 24:29  他们却强留他说，时候晚了，日头已经平西了，请你同我们住下吧。耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。这两个人为什么想要留耶稣与他们同住？
   30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. What was indicated by letting Jesus break the bread? 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. Explain why Jesus disappeared. 32 They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
24:30  到了坐席的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，掰开，递给他们。他们请耶稣掰饼，这说明了什么？ 24:31  他们的眼睛明亮了，这才认出他来。忽然耶稣不见了。请解释为什么耶稣不见了？ 24:32  他们彼此说，在路上，他和我们说话，给我们讲解圣经的时候，我们的心岂不是火热的吗？
   33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” Who else had Jesus appeared to? Why? 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
24:33  他们就立时起身，回耶路撒冷去，正遇见十一个使徒，和他们的同人，聚集在一处。 24:34  说，主果然复活，已经现给西门看了。耶稣还向谁显现了？为什么？ 24:35  两个人就把路上所遇见，和掰饼的时候怎么被他们认出来的事，都述说了一遍。

Jesus Appears to the Disciples耶稣向门徒显现
    36 While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” How did Jesus get in? What kind of peace?
   37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. What were the disciples slow to believe? 38 He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! ? Does Jesus give up on the disciples? Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
24:36  正说这话的时候，耶稣亲自站在他们当中，说，愿你们平安。耶稣是如何进入到他们中间的？什么样的平安？ 24:37  他们却惊慌害怕，以为所看见的是魂。门徒还没有相信什么？ 24:38  耶稣说，你们为什么愁烦？为什么心里起疑念呢？ 24:39  你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。耶稣有没有放弃门徒？摸我看看。魂无骨无肉，你们看我是 有 的 。
   40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. What additional proof did Jesus provide?  41 And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it in their presence. What was the significance of eating the fish?
24:40  说了这话，就把手和脚给他们看。耶稣还提供了什么额外的证据（来证明他就是复活的耶稣）？ 24:41  他们正喜得不敢信，并且希奇，耶稣就说，你们这里有什么吃的没有。 24:42  他们便给他一片烧鱼。（有古卷在此有和一块蜜房） 24:43  他接过来，在他们面前吃了。在这里（耶稣）把鱼吃了，这有什么重要性？
   44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.” What does Jesus once again remind the disciples?
   45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 46 He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, 47 and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. What commission are His followers given? 48 You are witnesses of these things. 49 I am going to send you what my Father has promised;but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.” What promise does Jesus give to His witnesses?
24:44  耶稣对他们说，这就是我从前与你们同在之时，所告诉你们的话，说，摩西的律法，先知的书，和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话，都必须应验。耶稣再一次提醒门徒什么？ 24:45  于是耶稣开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。 24:46  又对他们说，照经上所写的，基督必受害，第三日从死里复活。 24:47  并且人要奉他的名传悔改赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。门徒领受到的大使命是什么？ 24:48  你们就是这些事的见证。 24:49  我要将我父所应许的降在你们身上。你们要在城里等候，直到你们领受从上头来的能力。耶稣给了他的见证人什么样的应许？

The Ascension of Jesus耶稣升天 took place 40 days after Jesus rose.发生在耶稣复活后的第40天
    50 When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. Where is Bethany? 51 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. When will Jesus return? 52 Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. 53 And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. What does it mean to worship Jesus?
24:50耶稣领他们到伯大尼的对面，就举手给他们祝福。伯大尼在哪里？24:51正祝福的时候，他就离开他们，被带到天上去了。耶稣什么时候会再来？24:52他们就拜他，大大地欢喜，回耶路撒冷去。24:53常在殿里称颂神。什么是敬拜耶稣？
