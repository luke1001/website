路加福音 Luke 13:1-35
The incidence mentioned in verse 1 was an act which was quite in character for Pilate. During his 10 years in office as the Roman governor he had shown himself insensitive to what the Jews regarded as holy. In this instance it was an outrage committed in the part of the temple called the court of the priests. On the occasion in question, the sacrifices were going forward when Pilate's soldiers burst in. They were pursuing certain Galileans. These very likely had engaged in an insurrection against the Roman rule, or they were suspected of rebellion. The soldiers killed the Galileans then and there. When they did so, the blood of their victims became mixed with the blood of the sacrifices. The sacrifices were polluted. The people reporting the incidence were not trying to make a charge against Pontius Pilate. Jesus could tell what really bothered them.
第一节中提到的事例和彼拉多的性格相符。在担任罗马行政官的十多年中，他对犹太人看为圣洁的事漠不关心。这件事是发生在圣殿中祭祀院（译注：献祭的地方）里的一件暴行。可能是在某时，当献祭正在进行的时候，彼拉多的士兵闯入。他们在寻找一些加利利人。这些人可能参与了反抗罗马政府的叛乱，或者他们有参与叛乱的嫌疑。那些士兵就在那里杀了他们。当他们这样做的时候，那些受害者的血就和祭物的血混在一起。祭物就被玷污了。人们把这件事告诉耶稣并不是要控告本丢彼拉多。耶稣说明了使他们恼火的实际原因。
Repent or Perish
 1 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? What were the people thinking when Jesus answered them? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. What would happen if they did not repent? 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.” On what should the people focus?
 6 Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. 7 So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! What did the man want to do with the fig tree? Why? Why should it use up the soil?’
   8 “‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it. 9 If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’” Who do you think owns the vineyard? Who do you think is the man who wanted to wait one more year? What does this tell us about God's love?
悔改或灭亡
1 正当那时，有人将彼拉多使加利利人的血搀杂在他们祭物中的事告诉耶稣。2 耶稣说：「你们以为这些加利利人比众加利利人更有罪，所以受这害吗？当耶稣回答他们的时候人们在想些什么？3 我告诉你们，不是的！你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡！如果他们不悔改将会发生什么？4 从前西罗亚楼倒塌了，压死十八个人；你们以为那些人比一切住在耶路撒冷的人更有罪吗？5 我告诉你们，不是的！你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡！」人们应当关心什么？
6 于是用比喻说：「一个人有一棵无花果树栽在葡萄园里。他来到树前找果子，却找不着。7 就对管园的说：『看哪，我这三年来到这无花果树前找果子，竟找不着。把它砍了吧，那个人要对无花果树做什么？为什么？何必白占地土呢！』8 管园的说：『主啊，今年且留着，等我周围掘开土，加上粪；9 以后若结果子便罢，不然再把它砍了。』」你认为葡萄园的主人是谁？那个希望等候一年的人是谁？这些使我们知道了哪些关于神的爱的信息？

Notes
Verses 6-7: It is thought that the vineyard = Israel, and the fig tree = Jerusalem. God had expended a great deal of spiritual care on Jerusalem, even more than he hand on Israel as a whole. God had chosen Jerusalem as the center for the true worship of himself. To Jerusalem especially God had sent the prophets to bring their message of the coming Messiah. But when God looked for the spiritual fruit in the people of Jerusalem, he did not find any. That means he did not find faith. God looked for faith in the people of Jerusalem, but he found only stubborn unbelief. We will see this in verse 34.
注释
6-7节：有人认为葡萄园=以色列，无花果树=耶路撒冷。神曾为耶路撒冷倾注了许多属灵的关怀，比祂在整个以色列上所花费的还要多。神曾拣选耶路撒冷作为真正敬拜祂的中心。神特别差遣先知带来弥赛亚来到的信息。但当神寻找在耶路撒冷的人所有的属灵果实的时候，祂什么也没找到。就是说他没有找到信心。神寻找住在耶路撒冷的人的信心，但只找到了顽梗的不信。我们会在34节进一步看到。

Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath
 10 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, 11 and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. What was wrong with the woman? 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.” What did Jesus do? 13 Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. What was the woman's response to the healing?
 14 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, Who did the synagogue leader address?  “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.” What did the leader think of Jesus healing?
 15 The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? What do people care for on the Sabbath? 16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?” What did Jesus want the people to realize?
 17 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. What does Jesus want us to understand about the Sabbath?
安息日治好驼背的女人
10 安息日，耶稣在会堂里教训人。11 有一个女人被鬼附着，病了十八年，腰弯得一点直不起来。这女人有什么问题？12 耶稣看见，便叫过她来，对她说：「女人，你脱离这病了！」耶稣做了什么？13 于是用两只手按着她；她立刻直起腰来，就归荣耀与　神。14 管会堂的因为耶稣在安息日治病，就气忿忿地对众人说：管会堂的在向谁讲话？「有六日应当做工；那六日之内可以来求医，在安息日却不可。」管会堂的是怎么看待耶稣的医治的？15 主说：「假冒为善的人哪，难道你们各人在安息日不解开槽上的牛、驴，牵去饮吗？人们在安息日的时候关心什么事？16 况且这女人本是亚伯拉罕的后裔，被撒但捆绑了这十八年，不当在安息日解开她的绑吗？」耶稣想要人们意识到什么？17 耶稣说这话，他的敌人都惭愧了；众人因他所行一切荣耀的事，就都欢喜了。对于安息日，耶稣想要我们明白什么？


The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
 18 Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? What did Jesus want the people to know? 19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.” What do we learn about the growth of God's kingdom?
 20 Again he asked, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? 21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.” What does the parable teach us about the growth of the Kingdom in peoples' lives?
芥菜种和面酵的比喻
18 耶稣说：「　神的国好像什么？我拿什么来比较呢？耶稣想要众人知道什么？19 好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在园子里，长大成树，天上的飞鸟宿在它的枝上。」关于神国的增长，我们学到了什么？20 又说：「我拿什么来比　神的国呢？21 好比面酵，有妇人拿来藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。」关于神的国人们的生活中的增长，这个比喻教导了我们什么？

The Narrow Door
 22 Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. Where was Jesus final destination? What would happen there? 23 Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” Why do you think this question was asked?
   He said to them, 24 “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. Why can't some people find the door?What is the only way we can enter through the narrow door? 25 Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ What had the people who could not enter failed to do?
   “But he will answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
   26 “Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’ What claim is made by the people trying to get in?
   27 “But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!’ Why doesn't Jesus know them?
   28 “There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. Who will be seen in heaven? Who will not be allowed inside? 29 People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. Where will the people who are permitted into heaven come from? 30 Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.” How can the last be first?
当进窄门
22 耶稣往耶路撒冷去，在所经过的各城各乡教训人。耶稣最终要到哪里去？那里会发生什么？23 有一个人问他说：「主啊，得救的人少吗？」你觉得为什么会问这个问题？24 耶稣对众人说：「你们要努力进窄门。我告诉你们，将来有许多人想要进去，却是不能。为什么许多人找不着门？我们得以进入窄门的唯一路径是什么？25 及至家主起来关了门，你们站在外面叩门，说：『主啊，给我们开门！』那些不能进去的人做错了什么事？他就回答说：『我不认识你们，不晓得你们是哪里来的！』26 那时，你们要说：『我们在你面前吃过喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。』那些想要进去的人说了什么？27 他要说：『我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！』耶稣为什么不认识他们？28 你们要看见亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，和众先知都在　神的国里，你们却被赶到外面，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。天堂里会看见谁？哪些人不允许进入？29 从东、从西、从南、从北将有人来，在　神的国里坐席。那些被准许进入天堂的从哪里来？30 只是有在后的，将要在前；有在前的，将要在后。」在后的怎么会在前？


Jesus’ Sorrow for Jerusalem
 31 At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.” Why would the Pharisees try to keep Jesus from entering Jerusalem?
 32 He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’ What kind of animal is a fox? Describe the work of Jesus as He continues on to Jerusalem. 33 In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! Where does Jesus know He must die?
   34 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. How does Jesus describe His concern for Jerusalem? What does Jesus' cry of sadness for Jerusalem teach us about His love? 35 Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. What warning does Jesus give?
为耶路撒冷哀哭
31 正当那时，有几个法利赛人来对耶稣说：「离开这里去吧，因为希律想要杀你。」为什么法利赛人试图阻止耶稣进入耶路撒冷？32 耶稣说：「你们去告诉那个狐狸说：『今天、明天我赶鬼治病，第三天我的事就成全了。』狐狸是一种怎样的动物？请描述耶稣继续朝向耶路撒冷前行的事工。33 虽然这样，今天、明天、后天，我必须前行，因为先知在耶路撒冷之外丧命是不能的。耶稣知道自己将要死在哪里？34 耶路撒冷啊！耶路撒冷啊！你常杀害先知，又用石头打死那奉差遣到你这里来的人。我多次愿意聚集你的儿女，好像母鸡把小鸡聚集在翅膀底下；只是你们不愿意。耶稣怎样说明自己对耶路撒冷的关心？我们可以从祂为耶路撒冷哀哭的事上学到哪些关于祂的爱的教导35 看哪，你们的家成为荒场留给你们。我告诉你们，从今以后你们不得再见我，直等到你们说：『奉主名来的是应当称颂的。』」耶稣做出了什么警告？
