路加福音Luke 11:1-54
Luke gives neither the time or the place for Jesus teaching on prayer. It is thought that Jesus is repeating what He had taught on prayer during the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 6:5-15). It seems that for most of those in the audience, the things Jesus taught about prayer were entirely new.
对于耶稣在祷告上的教导，路加没有给出这件事发生的时间和地点。一般认为，耶稣是在重复祂在登山宝训（马太福音6：5-15）中关于祷告的教导。对于当时在场的人来说，耶稣在祷告上的教导是全新的。

Jesus' Teaching on Prayer耶稣对祷告的教训
    1One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples." Why would the disciple want to be taught to pray?
    2He said to them, "When you pray, say:
   " 'Father, hallowed be your name, What does this tell us about God the father's name?
   your kingdom come. When will God's kingdom come?
    3Give us each day our daily bread. What does daily bread represent?
    4Forgive us our sins, When Jesus died on the cross and rose, he won for us redemption and forgiveness of sins? Why are we asking for forgiveness?
      for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. How do we respond to others? Must the person ask for forgiveness in order to be forgiven?
   And lead us not into temptation. Who tempts us?
    5Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, 6because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.' Why has the friend gone to his neighbor? Would you go to your neighbor?
   11:1    耶穌在一個地方禱告．禱告完了、有個門徒對他說、求主教導我們禱告、像約翰教導他的門徒。门徒们为什么要求主教导他们祷告？
11:2    耶穌說、你們禱告的時候、要說、我們在天上的父、〔有古卷只作父阿〕願人都尊你的名為聖。关于天父的名，这里给了我们什么教导？願你的國降臨．願你的旨意行在地上如同行在天上。〔有古卷無願你的旨意云云〕 神的国什么时候降临？
11:3    我們日用的飲食、天天賜給我們。日用的饮食指的是什么？
11:4    赦免我們的罪、耶稣在十架上受死后又复活升天，祂已为我们赢得救赎和对罪的赦免。我们为什么还要神赦免我们的罪？因為我們也赦免凡虧欠我們的人。不叫我們遇見試探．救我們脫離兇惡。〔有古卷無末句〕我们应如何对待他人？人是不是一定要求才能得到赦免？谁试探我们？
11:5    耶穌又說、你們中間誰有一個朋友、半夜到他那裡去說、朋友、請借給我三個餅． 11:6    因為我有一個朋友行路、來到我這裡、我沒有甚麼給他擺上。这个朋友为什么到他的邻居家里去？你会去你的邻居家里吗？
    7"Then the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' What does the neighbor tell the man? 8I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs. What important point does Jesus make about receiving needed help from a friend?
    9"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. How does Jesus encourage perseverance in prayer?
    11"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? How do we treat our child(ren) when they come to us with a need? 13If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" What will our heavenly Father give us?
11:7    那人在裡面回答說、不要攪擾我．門已經關閉、孩子們也同我在床上了．我不能起來給你。邻居是如何回答这个人的？ 11:8    我告訴你們、雖不因他是朋友起來給他、但因他情詞迫切的直求、就必起來照他所需用的給他。对于从朋友那里得到所需的帮助，耶稣在这里给出什么重要的教导？
11:9    我又告訴你們、你們祈求就給你們．尋找就尋見．叩門就給你們開門。 11:10    因為凡祈求的就得著、尋找的就尋見．叩門的就給他開門。耶稣如何鼓励我们在祷告上要恒心？
11:11    你們中間作父親的、誰有兒子求餅、反給他石頭呢．求魚、反拿蛇當魚給他呢． 11:12    求雞蛋、反給他蠍子呢。 当我们的孩子有需要来求我们的时候，我们是怎么做的？11:13    你們雖然不好、尚且知道拿好東西給兒女。何況天父、豈不更將聖靈給求他的人麼。我们在天上的父会给我们什么？

NOTES注释

His disciples - It has been thought that the disciple could not have been one of the Twelve, but must have been one of the seventy-two or one from the wider circle of believers.
门徒 --- 一般认为，这个门徒不是十二门徒中的一位，但一定是七十二门徒或是更广义的门徒中的一位。
Temptation - God does not tempt us. Satan tempts us to make us fall; God tests us in order to confirm our faith or prove our commitment.
试探--- 神不试探我们。撒旦试探我们要我们跌到；神试炼我们，为了要坚定我们的信心和委身。

Jesus and Beelzebub耶稣或别西卜
    14Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. What had the evil spirit caused? What had Jesus performed? 15But some of them said, "By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons." By whose power were people saying that Jesus drove out the demon? 16Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. What sign had Jesus already given them?
    17Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. What does Jesus know? 18If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub. 19Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? What had others been able to drive out? Were they of the devil? So then, they will be your judges. 20But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you. How does Jesus refute the charge that He casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan)? What has come to the people?
11:14    耶穌趕出一個叫人啞吧的鬼．鬼出去了、啞吧就說出話來．眾人都希奇。鬼做了什么事？耶稣做了什么事？ 11:15    內中卻有人說、他是靠著鬼王別西卜趕鬼。有人说耶稣是靠谁敢鬼的？ 11:16    又有人試探耶穌、向他求從天上來的神蹟。耶稣已经给了他们什么神迹？
11:17    他曉得他們的意念、便對他們說、凡一國自相分爭、就成為荒場．凡一家自相分爭、就必敗落。 耶稣知道什么？11:18    若撒但自相分爭、他的國怎能站得住呢．因為你們說我是靠著別西卜趕鬼。 11:19    我若靠著別西卜趕鬼、你們的子弟趕鬼、又靠著誰呢．這樣、他們就要斷定你們的是非。别的人也能赶出什么？他们是属魔鬼的吗？ 11:20    我若靠著　神的能力趕鬼、這就是　神的國臨到你們了。耶稣是如何驳斥了对于祂的控告？什么临到了这些人？
21"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. 22But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils. What is the correct way to interpret Jesus power over demons?
    23"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters. What is verse 23 telling us in your own words?
    24"When an evilspirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' 25When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Who is not living in the house? 26Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first." What happens to the man?
    27As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."
    28He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it." Who are the truly blessed?
11:21    壯士披掛整齊、看守自己的住宅、他所有的都平安無事． 11:22    但有一個比他更壯的來、勝過他、就奪去他所倚靠的盔甲兵器、又分了他的贓。什么才是对于耶稣大过魔鬼的正确解释？
11:23    不與我相合的、就是敵我的．不同我收聚的、就是分散的。用自己的话来讲一下，第23节告诉了我们什么？
11:24    污鬼離了人身、就在無水之地、過來過去、尋求安歇之處．既尋不著、便說、我要回到我所出來的屋裡去。11:25    到了、就看見裡面打掃乾淨、修飾好了．谁不在屋里住？ 11:26    便去另帶了七個比自己更惡的鬼來、都進去住在那裡．那人末後的景況、比先前更不好了。这个人发生了什么事？
11:27    耶穌正說這話的時候、眾人中間、有一個女人大聲說、懷你胎的和乳養你的有福了。
11:28    耶穌說、是、卻還不如聽　神之道而遵守的人有福。谁是真有福之人？      

NOTES注释
Beelzebub - The prince of demons; the Greek form of the Hebrew name (Baal-Zebub ("lord of flies"). This name is a mockery for the worship of the false god, Baal, in the Old Testament.
别西卜---魔鬼之子；希伯来名“苍蝇王”的希腊文叫法。在旧约里，这个名字表达的是一种对拜假神巴力的嘲笑。

The Sign of Jonah 约拿的神迹
Jonah 1 – 2约拿书 1-2
1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai: 2 "Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before me."
    3 But Jonah ran away from the LORD and headed for Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port. After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the LORD.
    4 Then the LORD sent a great wind on the sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up. 5 All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
      But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. 6 The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your god! Maybe he will take notice of us, and we will not perish."
    7 Then the sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity." They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
    8 So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us? What do you do? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?"
    9 He answered, "I am a Hebrew and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land."
    10 This terrified them and they asked, "What have you done?" (They knew he was running away from the LORD, because he had already told them so.)
    11 The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"
    12 "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm. I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you."
    13 Instead, the men did their best to row back to land. But they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before. 14 Then they cried to the LORD, "O LORD, please do not let us die for taking this man's life. Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man, for you, O LORD, have done as you pleased." 15 Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the raging sea grew calm. 16 At this the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to him.
17 But the LORD provided a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.
1:1    耶和華的話臨到亞米太的兒子約拿、說、
1:2    你起來往尼尼微大城去、向其中的居民呼喊、因為他們的惡達到我面前。
1:3    約拿卻起來、逃往他施去躲避耶和華．下到約帕、遇見一隻船、要往他施去。他就給了船價、上了船、要與船上的人同往他施去躲避耶和華。
1:4    然而耶和華使海中起大風、海就狂風大作、甚至船幾乎破壞。
1:5    水手便懼怕、各人哀求自己的神．他們將船上的貨物拋在海中、為要使船輕些。約拿已下到底艙、躺臥沉睡。
1:6    船主到他那裡對他說、你這沉睡的人哪、為何這樣呢。起來、求告你的神、或者神顧念我們、使我們不至滅亡。
1:7    船上的人彼此說、來罷、我們掣籤、看看這災臨到我們是因誰的緣故．於是他們掣籤、掣出約拿來。
1:8    眾人對他說、請你告訴我們、這災臨到我們是因誰的緣故．你以何事為業．你從那裡來．你是哪一國、屬那一族的人。
1:9    他說、我是希伯來人．我敬畏耶和華、那創造滄海旱地之天上的　神。
1:10    他們就大大懼怕、對他說、你作的是甚麼事呢．他們已經知道他躲避耶和華、因為他告訴了他們。
1:11    他們問他說、我們當向你怎樣行、使海浪平靜呢．這話是因海浪越發翻騰。
1:12    他對他們說、你們將我抬起來、拋在海中、海就平靜了．我知道你們遭這大風、是因我的緣故。
1:13    然而那些人竭力盪槳、要把船攏岸、卻是不能．因為海浪越發向他們翻騰。
1:14    他們便求告耶和華說、耶和華阿、我們懇求你、不要因這人的性命使我們死亡．不要使流無辜血的罪歸與我們．因為你耶和華是隨自己的意旨行事。
1:15    他們遂將約拿抬起、拋在海中、海的狂浪就平息了。
1:16    那些人便大大敬畏耶和華、向耶和華獻祭、並且許願。
1:17    耶和華安排一條大魚吞了約拿、他在魚腹中三日三夜。

    29As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. Look at Jonah 1:17. How long was Jonah in the well of the large fish? 30For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. When Jesus died, how long until he rose? What sign will the people have? 31The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, What had the Queen of Sheba realized?  and now onegreater than Solomon is here. Who is there with the people now?  32The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here. What had the people of Nineveh done? What should the people in Jesus presence do?
11:29    當眾人聚集的時候、耶穌開講說、這世代是一個邪惡的世代．他們求看神蹟、除了約拿的神蹟以外、再沒有神蹟給他們看。参见约拿书1：17.约拿在大鱼肚子里呆了多久？11:30    約拿怎樣為尼尼微人成了神蹟、人子也要照樣為這世代的人成了神蹟。耶稣死后多久复活？人们将会看到什么神迹？ 11:31    當審判的時候、南方的女王、要起來定這世代的罪．因為他從地極而來、要聽所羅門的智慧話．看哪、在這裡有一人比所羅門更大。南方的女王认识到了什么？这时谁在人们的当中？11:32    當審判的時候、尼尼微人要起來定這世代的罪．因為尼尼微人聽了約拿所傳的、就悔改了．看哪、在這裡有一人比約拿更大。尼尼微人做了什么事？人们在耶稣的面前应该做什么？

NOTES注释
Queen of the South - The Queen of Sheba. Sheba was a mercantile kingdom that flourished in southwest Arabia. It profited from sea trade. the queen of Sheba recognized a connection between the wisdom of Solomon and the God he served.
南方的女王 --- 示巴女王。示巴是兴旺在阿拉伯半岛西南部的一个贸易王国。他从海贸中得益。示巴女王认识到所罗门的智慧是与他所服侍的神有关的。

The Lamp of the Body 身上的灯
    33"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. Who is the lamp or light? 34Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. How can our bodies be good? But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness. How can our bodies be bad? 35See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. 36Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you." What will happen if we let Jesus live in us?
11:33    沒有人點燈放在地窨子裡、或是斗底下、總是放在燈臺上、使進來的人得見亮光。谁是灯或光？ 11:34    你眼睛就是身上的燈、你的眼睛若瞭亮、全身就光明．眼睛若昏花、全身就黑暗。我们的身体如何才能光明？ 我们的身体如何变的黑暗？11:35    所以你要省察、恐怕你裡頭的光、或者黑暗了。 11:36    若是你全身光明、毫無黑暗、就必全然光明、如同燈的明光照亮你。如果我们要耶稣住在我们心里，会有什么事情发生？

Six Woes六祸
    37When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. What was Jesus willing to do? 38But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.
    39Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. What were the Pharisees more concerned with? What were they not concerned about? 40You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? What is meant by the inside? 41But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. What will the Pharisees no longer be guilty of? (vs. 39)
    42"Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone. What is Jesus condemning? What should be done?
11:37    說話的時候、有一個法利賽人請耶穌同他喫飯．耶穌就進去坐席。耶稣愿意做什么？ 11:38    這法利賽人看見耶穌飯前不洗手、便詫異。
11:39    主對他說、如今你們法利賽人洗淨杯盤的外面．你們裡面卻滿了勒索和邪惡。法利赛人更关心什么？他们不关心什么？ 11:40    無知的人哪、造外面的、不也造裡面麼。里面指的是什么？ 11:41    只要把裡面的施捨給人、凡物於你們就都潔淨了。法利赛人不再因什么而有罪？（39节） 11:42    你們法利賽人有禍了．因為你們將薄荷芸香、並各樣菜蔬、獻上十分之一、那公義和愛　神的事、反倒不行了．這原是你們當行的、那也是不可不行的。耶稣在咒诅什么？应该做什么？
    43"Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. What are the Pharisees after?
    44"Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it." What could happen to people by associating with the Pharisees?
45One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."
    46Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them. With what type of burdens do the Pharisees load the people down?
    47"Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them. What had happened to some of God's prophets? 48So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. 49Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.' 50Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, 51from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all. What will the Pharisees be held responsible for?
    52"Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. What knowledge? You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering." Who are they hindering?
    53When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, 54waiting to catch him in something he might say. What did the Pharisees and teachers of the law refuse to admit? What type of action did the Pharisees and teachers of the law pursue?
11:43    你們法利賽人有禍了．因為你們喜愛會堂裡的首位、又喜愛人在街市上問你們的安。法利赛人在追求什么？
11:44    你們有禍了．因為你們如同不顯露的墳墓、走在上面的人並不知道。与法利赛人同行的人会有什么事情发生在他们身上？
11:45    律法師中有一個回答耶穌說、夫子、你這樣說、也把我們蹧蹋了。
11:46    耶穌說、你們律法師也有禍了．因為你們把難擔的擔子、放在人身上、自己一個指頭卻不肯動。法利赛人把什么样担子压在人身上？
11:47    你們有禍了．因為你們修造先知的墳墓、那先知正是你們的祖宗所殺的。有什么事发生在神的一些先知身上？
11:48    可見你們祖宗所作的事、你們又證明又喜歡．因為他們殺了先知、你們修造先知的墳墓。 11:49    所以　神用智慧曾說、〔用智慧或作的智者〕我要差遣先知和使徒、到他們那裡去．有的他們要殺害、有的他們要逼迫。 11:50    使創世以來、所流眾先知血的罪、都要問在這世代的人身上． 11:51    就是從亞伯的血起、直到被殺在壇和殿中間撒迦利亞的血為止．我實在告訴你們、這都要問在這世代的人身上。 法利赛人要为什么负责？
11:52    你們律法師有禍了．因為你們把知識的鑰匙奪了去．自己不進去、正要進去的人、你們也阻擋他們。 什么知识？他们阻挡了谁？
11:53    耶穌從那裡出來、文士和法利賽人就極力的催逼他、引動他多說話． 11:54    私下窺聽、要拿他的話柄。法利赛人和文士拒绝承认什么？法利赛人和文士采取了什么行动？
