路加福音 Luke 18:1-43
Luke 18:1-43
         Jesus is still addressing His disciples. In Luke 17:22-37 Jesus had given them advice as to how they should conduct themselves before the Last Day. This is the same setting at the beginning of this chapter. Jesus wanted to show the disciples that they should always pray, and never give up because their faith will be tested.
耶稣仍然在教导祂的门徒。在路加福音17章22至37节，耶稣已经教导他们在末世的时候当怎样行。在这一章的起始也有着同样的背景。耶稣要祂的门徒明白要常常祷告，不可放弃因为他们的信心要经过试验。

The Parable of the Persistent Widow
    1 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. What does it mean not to give up? 2 He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. What do we learn about this judge? 3 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, How often did the widow come? ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ What did the widow want?
   4 “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, 5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually wear me out with her coming!’” What did the judge want?
   6 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. 7 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? If an unjust God will give justice because of persistence, what can we expect from a just judge (God)? Will he keep putting them off? 8 I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. What is God's attitude toward believers? However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?” Why does Jesus ask this searching question?
执着的寡妇的比喻
1 耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心。不可灰心是什么意思？2 说：「某城里有一个官，不惧怕　神，也不尊重世人。我们对这个官有怎样的了解？3 那城里有个寡妇，常到他那里，这个寡妇多长时间来一次？说：『我有一个对头，求你给我伸冤。』这个寡妇要求什么？4 他多日不准，后来心里说：『我虽不惧怕　神，也不尊重世人，这个官想怎样？5 只因这寡妇烦扰我，我就给她伸冤吧，免得她常来缠磨我！』」6 主说：「你们听这不义之官所说的话。7 神的选民昼夜呼吁他，他纵然为他们忍了多时，如果一个不公正的官会因为执着而行使正义，我们会在那公正的官（神）那里存留怎样的盼望？岂不终久给他们伸冤吗？8 我告诉你们，要快快地给他们伸冤了。神对信徒的心意是怎样的？然而，人子来的时候，遇得见世上有信德吗？」为什么耶稣要问“遇得见”的问题？
Notes注释
Neither feared God nor cared what people thought - The judge had no regard for his fellow men. He did not care about the anger people may have towards him because of his rulings.
不惧怕　神，也不尊重世人 - 这个官不尊重属他的人。他不关心人们是否会因为他的统治而怨恨他。

The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector
    9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. Tell me what you know about Pharisees? tax collectors? 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. For what does the Pharisee thank God? What does the Pharisee leave out of his prayer? What does the Pharisee think of the tax collector? 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ Is the Pharisee praying or boasting? Why?
   13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ Describe how the tax collector prayed to God?
         1.
         2.
         3.
         4.
What had the tax collector hoped to receive from God?
   14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. Why was the tax collector forgiven? Why was the Pharisee not forgiven? For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. How did God humble the Pharisee? How did God exalt the tax collector?
法利赛人和税吏的比喻
9 耶稣向那些仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，10 说：「有两个人上殿里去祷告：一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。请分享你对法利赛人和税吏有哪些了解？11 法利赛人站着，自言自语地祷告说：『　神啊，我感谢你，我不像别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不像这个税吏。法利赛人为着什么向神感恩？法利赛人的祷告遗漏了什么？法利赛人怎么看待税吏的？12 我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的都捐上十分之一。』这个法利赛人是在祷告还是在自夸？为什么？13 那税吏远远地站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：『　神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！』请描述这个税吏是怎样向神祷告的？

这个税吏盼望从神那里得到什么？
14 我告诉你们，这人回家去比那人倒算为义了；因为，凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。」神怎样使那个法利赛人降卑？神怎样升高这个税吏？


Notes注释
To pray – Periods for prayer were scheduled daily in connection with the morning and evening sacrifices. People could also go to the temple at any time for private prayer.
祷告 - 在早晨和傍晚的献祭时间有预定的祷告时间。人们也可以随时到圣殿做个人的祷告。

Pharisee – A legalistic and separatistic group who believed God’s grace only extended to those who strictly kept the Law of Moses. They believed traditions were equal to God’s Word. They were often regarded as shining examples of religious devotion and of holy living.
法利赛人 - 一个主张严格遵行律法和独立的群体，他们相信神的恩典只给予严格遵行摩西律法的人。他们相信人的传统和神的话同等。他们常被看为是虔诚和圣洁生活的模范。

Tax collector – They are traditionally known as “publicans”. These were local men employed by Roman tax contractors to collect taxes for them. Because they worked for Rome and often demanded unreasonable payments, the tax collectors gained a bad reputation and were generally hated and considered traitors. They could not serve as witnesses or as judges. In the eyes of the Jewish community their disgrace extended to their families.
税吏 - 他们通常被称作“收税员”。他们是由罗马收税官所雇用的犹太人，为罗马政府征税。因为他们为罗马工作并且常常征收不合理的款项，税吏的名声很差，被人憎恨，看做叛徒。他们不能做见证人或官长。在犹太群体看来税吏的一家都会蒙羞。

Fast twice a week - God had commanded only one fast during the year, on the Great Day of Atonement. This Pharisee fasted 104 times a year, twice a week, on the second and on the fifth day of the week. These were the market days when country people came to town.
一个礼拜禁食两次 - 神仅命令在每年赎罪日的时候禁食一次。这个法利赛人一年禁食104次，在每周的第二天和第五天禁食两次。这是乡下人来城里赶集的日子。

Give a tenth - The Jews were commanded to give this amount for the maintenance of the priests, Levites, the Temple and for the Temple services.
捐上十分之一 - 犹太人的律法要求捐出这些来供养祭祀，利未人以及圣殿和圣殿的敬拜。

Mercy - In other situations we have heard the word "mercy" used when people asked for healing. In this case, "mercy" means to be made gracious or granted forgiveness.
开恩可怜 - 通常我们知道“开恩”常被人们用来寻求医治，但在这里“开恩”的意思是恩惠或给予赦免。

The Little Children and Jesus
    15 People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. What did people want from Jesus? When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. Why would the disciples rebuke the people? 16 But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. What did Jesus tell the disciples? Do you think the disciples deserved this rebuke? Why? 17 Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” Explain what it means to be like "a little child".
耶稣和小孩子们
15 有人抱着自己的婴孩来见耶稣，要他摸他们；人们想要从耶稣那里寻求什么？门徒看见就责备那些人。门徒为什么要责备那些人？16 耶稣却叫他们来，说：「让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在　神国的正是这样的人。耶稣对门徒说什么？你认为门徒应该被责备吗？为什么？17 我实在告诉你们，凡要承受　神国的，若不像小孩子，断不能进去。」请解释像“小孩子”是什么意思？

The Rich and the Kingdom of God
    18 A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” What does the man call Jesus? What does the man want?
   19 “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone. What did the ruler believe when he called Jesus good? 20 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” What does Jesus answer tell us about the ruler?
   21 “All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said. What did the ruler believe?  1.                                                2.            
3.                                              4.
5.
   22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. What was the man to do? Why? Then come, follow me.”
   23 When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. What made the man sad? Where was the man's heart? 24 Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! 25 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” Why would it be hard for a rich man to enter God's kingdom? (Hint - think about the rich man's attitude toward God.)
   26 Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” How had the people thought they could be saved?
   27 Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.” What is not possible for man?
   28 Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” What understanding did the disciples have?
   29 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God 30 will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come eternal life.” What will people who follow Jesus receive in this age? and in the age to come?
富足的官和神的国
18 有一个官问耶稣说：「良善的夫子，我该做什么事才可以承受永生？」这个人是怎样称呼耶稣的？，他想得到什么？19 耶稣对他说：「你为什么称我是良善的？除了　神一位之外，再没有良善的。当这个官称呼耶稣是良善的时，他相信什么？20 诫命你是晓得的：『不可奸淫；不可杀人；不可偷盗；不可作假见证；当孝敬父母。』」耶稣的回答使我们对这个官有哪些了解？21 那人说：「这一切我从小都遵守了。」这个官相信什么？
1.                                                2.            
3.                                              4.
5.
22 耶稣听见了，就说：「你还缺少一件：要变卖你一切所有的，分给穷人，就必有财宝在天上；这个人要做什么？为什么？你还要来跟从我。」23 他听见这话，就甚忧愁，因为他很富足。是什么使这个人忧愁？这个人的心在何处？24 耶稣看见他，就说：「有钱财的人进　神的国是何等的难哪！25骆驼穿过针的眼比财主进　神的国还容易呢！」为什么有钱财的人进神的国很难？（提示- 思考这个富有的人对神的态度？）26 听见的人说：「这样，谁能得救呢？」人们是怎样认为自己可以得救的？27 耶稣说：「在人所不能的事，在　神却能。」什么是人所不能的事？28 彼得说：「看哪，我们已经撇下自己所有的跟从你了。」门徒是怎么理解耶稣说的话的？29 耶稣说：「我实在告诉你们，人为　神的国撇下房屋，或是妻子、弟兄、父母、儿女，30 没有在今世不得百倍，在来世不得永生的。」跟随耶稣的人今世得到什么？来世呢？

Notes注释
Ruler - Probably a member of an official council or court.
官 - 可能是议会或法院的成员之一。

Eye of a needle - Jesus was referring to a well-known gate through which people on foot entered a walled city. It was so narrow that a camel could squeeze through it only if the load was removed and the camel would then crawl through on its knees.
针的眼 - 耶稣在指一个进入城门要经过的有名的门。这个门非常狭窄，所以骆驼要穿过的话必须卸下所有货物，然后才可以爬行进入。

Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time
    31 Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. What will be fulfilled? 32 He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him; 33 they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.” Describe what will happen in Jerusalem.
1                                   2                                   3

What will happen on the third day?
   34 The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. Describe the disciples reaction to Jesus prediction.
耶稣第三次预言受难
31 耶稣带着十二个门徒，对他们说：「看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，先知所写的一切事都要成就在人子身上。什么将要成就？32 他将要被交给外邦人；他们要戏弄他，凌辱他，吐唾沫在他脸上，33 并要鞭打他，杀害他；第三日他要复活。」描述将要在耶路撒冷发生的事
1                                   2                                   3
4                                   5                                   6
第三天将会发生什么？
34 这些事门徒一样也不懂得，意思乃是隐藏的；他们不晓得所说的是什么。描述门徒们对耶稣的语言的反应。


A Blind Beggar Receives His Sight
    35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. 36 When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. 37 They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
   38 He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” What did the blind man believe?
   39 Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” What did the blind man want?
   40 Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, 41 “What do you want me to do for you?” How did Jesus treat the man?   “Lord, I want to see,” he replied. What did the man call Jesus?
   42 Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” What healed the man? 43 Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. What gift did the man receive? When all the people saw it, they also praised God. What can we learn from the blind man as Jesus passes by our lives?
瞎眼的乞丐得以看见
35 耶稣将近耶利哥的时候，有一个瞎子坐在路旁讨饭。36 听见许多人经过，就问是什么事。37 他们告诉他，是拿撒勒人耶稣经过。38 他就呼叫说：「大卫的子孙耶稣啊，可怜我吧！」这个瞎眼的人相信什么？39 在前头走的人就责备他，不许他作声；他却越发喊叫说：「大卫的子孙，可怜我吧！」瞎眼的人想要什么？40耶稣站住，吩咐把他领过来，到了跟前，就问他说：41 「你要我为你做什么？」耶稣是如何对待这个人的？他说：「主啊，我要能看见。」42 耶稣说：「你可以看见！你的信救了你了。」什么医治了这个人？43 瞎子立刻看见了，就跟随耶稣，一路归荣耀与　神。众人看见这事，也赞美　神。当耶稣从我们的生活中经过的时候，我们可以从这个瞎眼的人身上学到什么？
