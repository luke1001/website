路加福音 Luke 22:1-71
Luke 22:1-71路加福音22：1-71
(Map of Jerusalem at the time of Jesus crucifixion)
（耶稣受难时期耶路撒冷的地图）

            The eight-day festival of Passover remembers the freedom of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.
8天的逾越节筵席是为了纪念以色列人被神从古埃及的奴役中解救出来重获自由。
            After Joseph died in Genesis chapter 50, the Israelites became slaves to the Egyptian pharaohs/kings. During this time the Israelites were forced into backbreaking labor and unbearable horrors. God saw the people’s distress and sent Moses to Pharaoh with a message: “Send forth My people, so that they may serve Me.” But despite numerous warnings, Pharaoh refused to heed God’s command to let the Israelites leave. God then sent upon Egypt ten devastating plagues, afflicting them and destroying everything from their livestock to their crops.
约瑟去世后（记载在创世纪第50章），以色列人被沦为埃及法老的奴隶。在这段时期，他们被迫服苦役而且还要承受难以承受的恐惧。神看到祂子民的苦难就派摩西到法老那里告诉他：“容我的子民去，好事奉我。”但是尽管有许多的警告，法老还是拒绝服从神的命令放以色列人走。于是神降十灾于埃及，使他们受苦，从他们的牲畜到庄稼都一并被毁坏。
            The last of the ten plagues on the Egyptians, killed all the Egyptian firstborns. While doing so, God spared the Children of Israel by “passing over” their homes—hence the name of the holiday. Pharaoh’s resistance was broken, and he chased his former slaves out of the land. The Israelites left in such a hurry, in fact, that the bread they baked as provisions for the way did not have time to rise. Six hundred thousand adult males, plus many more women and children, left Egypt on that day.
降在埃及人身上的十灾中的最后一灾杀死了埃及所有头生的。但同时神存留了以色列人头生的，使死亡“越过”他们的家----就是这个节期的名字。法老不再违抗神，他将他的奴隶赶出了埃及。以色列人离开的很匆忙，实际上，他们为路上预备的饼没有时间发酵。六十万成年男子，加上许多妇女和小孩，在那天一起离开了埃及。

Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus犹大同意出卖耶稣
1 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, 2 and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. 3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. What do you remember about Judas? 4 And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. Who wanted to destroy Jesus? Why? 5 They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 6 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. What was the agreement?
22:1  除酵节，又名逾越节，近了。 22:2  祭司长和文士，想法子怎么才能杀害耶稣，是因他们惧怕百姓。 22:3  这时，撒但入了那称为加略人犹大的心，他本是十二门徒里的一个，关于犹大你还记得什么？ 22:4  他去和祭司长并守殿官商量，怎么可以把耶稣交给他们。谁要害耶稣？为什么？ 22:5  他们欢喜，就约定给他银子。 22:6  他应允了，就找机会要趁众人不在跟前的时候，把耶稣交给他们。他们有什么样的交易？

Thursday.星期四
The Last Supper最后的晚餐
    7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”
            A room was needed, with a table, surrounded by couches, as the Passover lamb was eaten in reclining position. A lamb had to be bought, which was slain in the Temple by a priest between three and five o'clock and roasted in a private house, and bitter herbs, wine, and unleavened bread had to be bought.
22:7  除酵节，须宰逾越羊羔的那一天到了。 22:8  耶稣打发彼得，约翰，说，你们去为我们预备逾越节的筵席，好叫我们吃。
需要一间房，一张桌子，桌子周围放一些软椅，因为逾越节的羊羔是要靠躺在软椅上吃的。要买一只羊羔，羊羔要在圣殿里由祭司在三点到五点间宰杀，再在自家烤熟，还需要苦菜，酒和无酵饼。

   9 “Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.
   10 He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, 11 and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’ 12 He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.” What other recent time had Jesus given His disciples instructions to carry out that showed Jesus was all knowing?
22:9  他们问他说，要我们在哪里预备？ 22:10  耶稣说，你们进了城，必有人拿着一瓶水迎面而来。你们就跟着他，到他所进的房子里去。 22:11  对那家的主人说，夫子说，客房在哪里？我与门徒好在那里吃逾越节的筵席。 22:12  他必指给你们摆设整齐的一间大楼，你们就在那里预备。还有哪里耶稣也是给门徒一些指示要他们去做，从而显出耶稣是全知的？
   13 They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
22:13  他们去了，所遇见的，正如耶稣所说的。他们就预备了逾越节的筵席。
The main elements and order of the Passover Feast:
逾越节筵席的主要部分和顺序：
·      The participants arrange themselves in proper order, reclining on couches on the left side, around the table.
·      就餐者依序从左开始围着桌子靠躺在软椅上。
·      The first cup was filled with red wine and water.  A blessing was asked by the head of the family on the feast and on the cup.
·      第一杯是红酒和水。这家的主人为筵席和杯祈福。
·      The master of the house then tasted the wine and passed it around. A basin of water and a towel were handed around.
·      主人然后尝一口酒就将杯传下去。一盆水和一条毛巾也被传下去。
·      A prayer of Thanksgiving was offered. The eating of bitter herbs, as a reminder of the bitter slavery in Egypt.
·      感恩祷告。吃苦菜，以纪念在埃及的劳苦服役。
·      Someone asks "Why is this night special from all other nights?" At this time, the history of the Passover is read.
·      有人问“为什么这一夜特别不同于其他夜？”这时，就宣读逾越节的历史。
·      The singing of the first part of the Hallel (Psalms 113, 114) and the drinking of the second cup.
·      唱诗篇113和114，并喝第二杯。
·      The carving and eating of the lamb, together with unleavened bread.
·      切割羊羔以及同无酵饼一起进食羊羔。
·      Continuation of the meal, each eating as much as he liked, but always ending with the lamb. The third cup, known as the cup of blessing was passed around and drank.
·      继续晚餐，大家可尽情地吃，但总要以羊羔收尾。第三杯，也就是祝福杯，被传着喝。
·      The prayer after the meal is recited and there is singing of the last part of the Hallel (Psalms 115-118). The fourth cup.
·      晚餐后的祷告，唱诗篇115到118篇。第四杯。

            It appears that Luke is not recording the events in verses 14-30 in order. He records the most important first - the Lord's Supper. Then he tells of Jesus' comments about his betrayer and about the argument over who would be greatest. Judas was not present when Jesus gave the Lord's Supper.
路加在第14到30节好像并没有按顺序来记录这些事件。他先记录了最重要的----圣餐。然后他提到了耶稣关于背叛祂的人的话以及关于谁是最大的争论。耶稣分发圣餐时犹大不在场。
   14 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. 15 And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 16 For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.” Explain why Jesus want to eat this meal.
22:14  时候到了，耶稣坐席，使徒也和他同坐。 22:15  耶稣对他们说，我很愿意在受害以先，和你们吃这逾越节的筵席。 22:16  我告诉你们，我不再吃这筵席，直到成就在神的国里。请解释为什么耶稣要吃这筵席。

   17 After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among you. 18 For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” This was probably the third cup.
   19 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” What were the disciples to do to remember Jesus?
22:17  耶稣接过杯来，祝谢了，说，你们拿这个，大家分着喝。22:18  我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直等神的国来到。这可能是第三杯。
 22:19  又拿起饼来祝谢了，就掰开递给他们，说，这是我的身体，为你们舍的。你 们 也 应 当 如 此 行 ， 为 的 是 记 念 我 。门徒要如何来纪念耶稣？
   20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
22:20  饭后也照样拿起杯来，说，这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。
Read Jeremiah 31:31-34and answer the question: What is the "new covenant"?  
请读耶利米书 31：31-34，并回答这个问题：什么是“新约”？
31 “The days are coming,” declares the LORD,
   “when I will make a new covenant
with the people of Israel
   and with the people of Judah.
32 It will not be like the covenant
   I made with their ancestors
when I took them by the hand
   to lead them out of Egypt,
because they broke my covenant,
   though I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD.
33 “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel
   after that time,” declares the LORD.
“I will put my law in their minds
   and write it on their hearts.
I will be their God,
   and they will be my people.
34 No longer will they teach their neighbor,
   or say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’
because they will all know me,
   from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the LORD.
“For I will forgive their wickedness
   and will remember their sins no more.”
31:31  耶和华说，日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约， 31:32  不像我拉着他们祖宗的手，领他们出埃及地的时候，与他们所立的约。我虽作他们的丈夫，他们却背了我的约。这是耶和华说的。 31:33  耶和华说，那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样，我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上。我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。 31:34  他们各人不再教导自己的邻舍和自己的弟兄说，你该认识耶和华，因为他们从最小的到至大的都必认识我。我要赦免他们的罪孽，不再记念他们的罪恶。这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。

21 But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. What was Jesus letting the disciples know? What does this control tell us? 22 The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!” 23 They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
   24 A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. What other time had the disciples argued about who was the greatest? See Luke 9: 46. 25 Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. Who likes to call themselves the greatest? 26 But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. What does Jesus mean? 27 For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. How does Jesus serve His disciples?  28 You are those who have stood by me in my trials. 29 And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
22:21  看哪，那卖我之人的手，与我一同在桌子上。耶稣是要让门徒们知道什么？耶稣这样的掌控可以告诉我们什么？ 22:22  人子固然要照所预定的去世。但卖人子的人有祸了。 22:23  他们就彼此对问，是哪一个要作这事。 22:24  门徒起了争论，他们中间哪一个可算为大。在哪里还有一次门徒们也是在争论谁是最大？见路加福音9：46. 22:25  耶稣说，外邦人有君王为主治理他们。那掌权管他们的称为恩主。谁喜欢称自己是最大的？ 22:26  但你们不可这样。你们里头为大的，倒要像年幼的。为首领的，倒要像服事人的。耶稣指的是什么意思？ 22:27  是谁为大？是坐席的呢？是服事人的呢？不是坐席的大吗？然而我在你们中间，如同服事人的。耶稣是如何来服事门徒的？ 22:28  我在磨炼之中，常和我同在的就是你们。 22:29  我将国赐给你们，正如我父赐给我一样。 22:30  叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝。并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。
   31 “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” Who is Simon?Why did Jesus change Simon's name? Why does Simon need the extra prayers? What does Jesus foresee in Simon's future?
22:31  主又说，西门，西门，撒但想要得着你们，好筛你们，像筛麦子一样。 22:32  但我已经为你祈求，叫你不至于失了信心。你回头以后，要坚固你的弟兄。谁是西门？耶稣为什么要为西门改名？为什么西门需要额外的祷告？耶稣预见到西门未来会有什么事情？
   33 But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” How would you describe Peter’s bold statement?
   34 Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”
   35 Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”
   “Nothing,” they answered.
   36 He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. Why would the disciples have to take a purse, bag, and a sword? 37 It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.” What is Jesus once again telling the disciples?
   38 The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.”
   “That’s enough!” he replied.
22:33  彼得说，主阿，我就是同你下监，同你受死，也是甘心。你如何描述彼得大胆的陈述？ 22:34  耶稣说，彼得，我告诉你，今日鸡还没有叫，你要三次说不认得我。 22:35  耶稣又对他们说，我差你们出去的时候，没有钱囊，没有口袋，没有鞋，你们缺少什么没有。他们说，没有。 22:36  耶稣说，但如今有钱囊的可以带着，有口袋的也可以带着。没有刀的要卖衣服买刀。门徒为什么要带一个钱囊，口袋和刀？22:37  我告诉你们，经上写着说，他被列在罪犯之中。这话必应验在我身上，因为那关系我的事，必然成就。耶稣再一次告诉门徒什么？ 22:38  他们说，主阿，请看，这里有两把刀。耶稣说，够了。

Benefactors - A title for rulers as a display of honor
恩主 --- 统治者彰显尊荣的称号

Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives – Gethsemane耶稣在橄榄山祷告 ---- 客西马尼园
The word Gethsemane is made up either of two Hebrew words, signifying "valley of fatness" - that is, a fertile valley; or of two words, signifying "an olive-press." The garden itself was located on the western foot of the Mount of Olives and was less than fifty-seven yards square in area.  It was in the garden of Gethsemane that Jesus was betrayed by Judas and arrested.
客西马尼这个词或是由两个希伯来词组成的，代表“富饶之谷”--- 也就是，富饶的山谷；或是由两个词组成的，代表“橄榄园”。园子坐落在橄榄山的西山脚，不到57平方码大。耶稣就是在客西马尼园里被犹大卖并被捕的。

    39 Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. 40 On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.” What kind of temptation? 41 He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, 42 “Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” To whom does Jesus pray? What is Jesus asking? 43 An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. Name some ways we can tell Jesus is in agony.
   45 When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. Why were the disciples sorrowful? 46 “Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.” What does Jesus ask of the disciples?
22:39  耶稣出来，照常往橄榄山去。门徒也跟随他。 22:40  到了那地方，就对他们说，你们要祷告，免得入了迷惑。是什么样的迷惑？22:41  于是离开他们，约有扔一块石头那么远，跪下祷告， 22:42  说，父阿，你若愿意，就把这杯撤去。然 而 不 要 成 就 我 的 意 思 ， 只 要 成 就 你 的 意 思 。耶稣在向谁祷告？耶稣在求什么？ 22:43  有一位天使，从天上显现，加添他的力量。 22:44  耶稣极其伤痛，祷告更加恳切。汗珠如大血点，滴在地上。请列出从哪里方面我们可以看出耶稣当时在极度的痛苦中。 22:45  祷告完了，就起来，到门徒那里，见他们因为忧愁都睡着了。门徒们为什么忧愁？ 22:46  就对他们说，你们为什么睡觉呢？起来祷告，免得入了迷惑。耶稣要门徒们做什么？

Jesus Arrested耶稣被捕
    47 While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. Why were so many people needed? He approached Jesus to kiss him, 48 but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” What does a kiss symbolize?
   49 When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” 50 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. What had the disciples already forgotten?
   51 But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. What do we learn about Jesus?
   52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? Who came for Jesus? 53 Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.” Think of some reasons why Jesus had not been arrested earlier. What is starting?
22:47  说话之间，来了许多人，那十二个门徒里名叫犹大的，走在前头，为什么需要这么多人？就近耶稣，要与他亲嘴。 22:48  耶稣对他说，犹大，你用亲嘴的暗号卖人子吗？亲嘴代表什么？ 22:49  左右的人见光景不好，就说，主阿，我们拿刀砍可以不可以？ 22:50  内中有一个人，把大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他的右耳。门徒已经忘了什么？ 22:51  耶稣说，到了这个地步，由他们吧。就摸那人的耳朵，把他治好了。从这里关于耶稣我们了解到什么？22:52  耶稣对那些来拿他的祭司长，和守殿官，并长老，说，你们带着刀棒，出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗？谁来拿耶稣？22:53  我天天同你们在殿里，你们不下手拿我。现在却是你们的时候，黑暗掌权了。请想一想耶稣没有在早些时候被抓的原因有哪些？什么开始了？

            Jesus was arraigned before two courts, the Jewish Church Council and the civil court of the Romans. The Romans who ruled the country of the Jews, permitted the Jews to try all cases of a religious nature before the Sanhedrin; but the death sentence could not be executed without the consent of the governor. Thus it was that Jesus had to be tried by Pilate after the Council of the Hews had unanimously condemned Him to death.
耶稣要在两个法庭被审问，犹太教教会理事会和罗马政府的民事法庭。罗马当时统治着犹太人，他们允许犹太人在犹太人的最高法庭里审理宗教性质的案件；但是没有地方长官的同意他们不能执行死刑。所以耶稣在被犹太人的法庭全体一致地定为死罪后还要被彼拉多审问。

Peter Disowns Jesus彼得不认耶稣
    54 Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. 55 And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. Why do you think Peter came to the courtyard? 56 A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”
   57 But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said. This is Peter’s first denial.
   58 A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”
   “Man, I am not!” Peter replied. This is Peter’s second denial.
   59 About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” What were the people in the courtyard able to recognize?
   60 Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. 61 The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.” 62 And he went outside and wept bitterly. What did Peter remember? What does this account teach us about the nature of the human heart and of our Savior's heart?
22:54  他们拿住耶稣，把他带到大祭司的宅里。彼得远远地跟着。 22:55  他们在院子里生了火，一同坐着。彼得也坐在他们中间。你认为彼得为什么来到院子里？22:56  有一个使女，看见彼得坐在火光里，就定睛看他，说，这个人素来也是同那人一伙的。 22:57  彼得却不承认，说，女子，我不认得他。这是彼得第一次不认主？ 22:58  过了不多的时候，又有一个人看见他，说，你也是他们一党的。彼得说，你这个人，我不是。这是彼得第二次不认主？ 22:59  约过了一小时，又有一个人极力地说，他实在是同那人一伙的。因为他也是加利利人。院子里的人就要认出什么了？ 22:60  彼得说，你这个人，我不晓得你说的是什么。正说话之间鸡就叫了。 22:61  主转过身来，看彼得。彼得便想起主对他所说的话，今日鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。 22:62  他就出去痛哭。彼得记起了什么？关于人性和救主的心的本质，这件事教导了我们什么？

The Guards Mock Jesus兵丁戏弄耶稣
    63 The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. 64 They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” 65 And they said many other insulting things to him. How did the guards treat Jesus?
22:63  看守耶稣的人戏弄他，打他， 22:64  又蒙着他的眼，问他说，你是先知，告诉我们，打你的是谁。 22:65  他们还用许多别的话辱骂他。兵丁如何待耶稣？

Jesus Before Pilate and Herod耶稣在彼拉多和希律前受审
    66 At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. 67 “If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” Why did the chief priests and the teachers of the law want to hear Jesus call Himself the Messiah?
   Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe me, 68 and if I asked you, you would not answer. 69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.” What does Jesus answer mean?
   70 They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?”
   He replied, “You say that I am.”
   71 Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.” What is Jesus guilty of?
22:66  天 一 亮 ， 民 间 的 众 长 老 连 祭 司 长 带 文 士 都 聚 会 。 把耶稣带到他们的公会里， 22:67  说，你若是基督，就告诉我们。祭司长和文士为什么想要听耶稣称自己为弥赛亚？耶稣说，我若告诉你们，你们也不信。 22:68  我若问你们，你们也不回答。 22:69  从今以后，人子要坐在神权能的右边。耶稣的回答是什么意思？ 22:70  他们都说，这样，你是神的儿子吗？耶稣说，你们所说的是。 22:71  他们说，何必再用见证呢？他亲口所说的，我们都亲自听见了。耶稣犯了什么罪？
