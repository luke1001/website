路加福音 Luke 8:1-56
            We have heard that great multitudes followed Jesus, not only to see the miracles which He performed, but also to hear Him preach. Jesus however, knew that many of the people did not take to heart what they heard.
我们知道来跟从耶稣的有一大群人，他们不仅仅是看到祂施行的神迹，还听到了祂的讲道。但是耶稣知道也有很多人并没把听到的放进心里去。

The Parable of the Sower
撒种的比喻
1After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. Where was Jesus previous ministry? Where is He going now? The Twelve were with him, 2and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; 3Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. What do we learn about the relation of these women to Jesus? Jesus relation to the women?
1 过了不多日，耶稣周游各城各乡传道，宣讲　神国的福音。耶稣从前的事工在哪里？他现在是往哪里去？和他同去的有十二个门徒，2 还有被恶鬼所附、被疾病所累、已经治好的几个妇女，内中有称为抹大拉的马利亚（曾有七个鬼从她身上赶出来），3 又有希律的家宰苦撒的妻子约亚拿，并苏撒拿，和好些别的妇女，都是用自己的财物供给耶稣和门徒。我们知道这些妇女们和耶稣的关系是怎么样的？那耶稣与这些妇女的关系是怎么样的？
4While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: 5"A farmer went out to sow his seed. What size are most seeds when compared to plants? Who do you think the farmer might be?. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. How would you describe this soil that many people walked on? 6Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. Why are roots important? 7Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. What are some ways thorns can thorns choke a plant? 8Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown."
When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." Why does Jesus want the people to think about this parable?
4 当许多人聚集、又有人从各城里出来见耶稣的时候，耶稣就用比喻说：5 「有一个撒种的出去撒种。和作物比起来，种子通常有多大？你认为这个农夫是谁？撒的时候，有落在路旁的，被人践踏，天上的飞鸟又来吃尽了。你会怎样描述这许多人走过的土地？6 有落在磐石上的，一出来就枯干了，因为得不着滋润。根为什么重要？7 有落在荆棘里的，荆棘一同生长，把它挤住了。荆棘会怎样挤住作物？8 又有落在好土里的，生长起来，结实百倍。」耶稣说了这些话，就大声说：「有耳可听的，就应当听！」耶稣为什么想要人来思考这个比喻？

9His disciples asked him what this parable meant. Why couldn't the disciples figure out what the parable meant? 10He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,
   " 'though seeing, they may not see;
      though hearing, they may not understand.' Why doesn't Jesus want the people to understand the meaning of the parable?
9 门徒问耶稣说：「这比喻是什么意思呢？」为什么门徒们不明白这个比喻的意思？10 他说：「　神国的奥秘只叫你们知道；至于别人，就用比喻，叫他们看也看不见，听也听不明。」耶稣为什么不愿意人们明白这个比喻的意思？
    11"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Where is the seed sown? 12Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. What are some ways the Word of God is snatched away? 13Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. What are some troubles a person may experience that could cause him to fall away?14The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. Think of examples of people who might fit this description. 15But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. What kind of person produces this crop?
11 「这比喻乃是这样：种子就是　神的道。种子撒在了哪里？12 那些在路旁的，就是人听了道，随后魔鬼来，从他们心里把道夺去，恐怕他们信了得救。神的话语通过哪些方式被抢夺走了？13 那些在磐石上的，就是人听道，欢喜领受，但心中没有根，不过暂时相信，及至遇见试炼就退后了。一个人遇到些什么样的困难会使他退后呢？14 那落在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，走开以后，被今生的思虑、钱财、宴乐挤住了，便结不出成熟的子粒来。想想有没有人符合这样的描述？15 那落在好土里的，就是人听了道，持守在诚实善良的心里，并且忍耐着结实。」什么样的人会结实？


NOTES注释

Mary (called Magdalene) - Her hometown was Magdala. She is not to be confused with the other Mary's with whom Jesus came into contact.
抹大拉的马利亚-她的家乡是抹大拉。不要把她和那个和耶稣谈话的马利亚混淆起来。
Helping to support them - Jesus and His disciples did not provide for themselves by miracles, but were supported by the service and means of such grateful people as these women.
供给 -耶稣和祂的门徒并不是靠神迹维持生活，而是依靠服事和许多像这些妇女一样慷慨解囊的人用自己的财务支持。

Parables - Parables are a comparison or an illustration. They are usually stories out of ordinary life used to illustrate spiritual or moral truths; they had a single main point. Parables were particularly effective and easy to remember because Jesus used familiar scenes. Although parables clarified Jesus’ teaching, they also included hidden meanings needing further explanation. These hidden meanings challenged the sincerely interested to further inquiry, and taught truths that Jesus wanted to conceal from unbelievers.
比喻 – 比喻是一种比较或形象的描述。它们通常取材于日常生活中，并被用来描述属灵或道德上的真理；它们都有一个要点。比喻特别行之有效和易于记忆是因为耶稣常用相似的场景。尽管比喻阐明了耶稣的教训，它们也常包含隐藏的信息需要更进一步的解释。这些隐藏的信息挑战真诚寻求的人，引领他们更进一步的寻求，并且能教授耶稣想对不信的人所隐藏起来的真理。

A farmer went out to sow his seed – The farmers took seed by the handfuls and tossed it against the wind, scattering it here and there. Then the soil was prepared by being stirred to a depth of four inches with a plowshare (a curved piece of timber tipped off with a small piece of iron. The plow was pulled by oxen).
有一个撒种的出去撒种 – 农夫用手抓起种子迎着风分散的四处撒出去。土壤预先被犁头（在弯曲的木头上嵌有一些铁）翻动有四英寸深。

Some fell along the path – Grain fields are seldom fenced, and both people and animals freely used the narrow paths. The seed that fell on these trodden paths was especially exposed to attacks by birds.
有落在路旁的 – 谷物的田里很少用篱笆围着，人和牲畜都常常走出小径。这些种子落在这些践踏而出的小径上就特别容易被鸟儿吃掉。

Rock – Shallow soil on top of solid rock.
磐石-坚固的岩石上附有浅土
Withered – The seed on this rocky soil sprang up quickly because the thin layer of soil was warmed by the sun sooner than where the soil was deep; but as the roots could not grow into deep soil as the thin layer of soil soon dried, the young sprouts withered.
枯干 – 种子落在这磐石上的土壤里很快就发芽是因为浅的土壤比深的土壤更快的被太阳加热；但因为根不能够扎在土壤深处，当浅土很快被晒干后嫩芽就枯干了。
Thorns…choked the plants – The thorns or thistles grow in every wheat field in Palestine and can grow taller than a man. The thorns grow quicker than the grain, absorb the moisture and the nutriments of the soil, and shade the grain from the sunshine, so that it cannot develop into a strong, fruit-bearing plan.
荆棘….挤住了 ---在巴勒斯坦，几乎每一块麦地都长有荆棘或蓟，它们可以长到一个人一样高。荆棘比庄稼长得还快，它们吸收了土壤里的水分和养分，而且还把庄稼从阳光中遮盖了起来，以至于麦地不会有好的收成。
Good soil – Soil that was deep, rich, productive, free from weeds, and had been properly prepared.
好土---- 深厚的，肥沃的，多产的，不长杂草的土地，它们也会被（农夫）很好地看顾。
A hundred – One hundred grains for every grain of seed put in the ground.
一百倍--- 一颗落在地里的种子长出的庄稼结出一百粒种子。
Let him hear – Jesus was asking the people to think about what he was telling them.
就应当听---- 耶稣是要人们去思想他对他们讲的（教导）。

A Lamp on a Stand灯台上的灯
    16"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. What is the purpose of a lamp? Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. 17For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. Whenwill all be known? 18Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him." What do you think "will be taken from him"?
8:16    沒有人點燈用器皿蓋上、或放在床底下、灯是作什么用的？乃是放在燈臺上、叫進來的人看見亮光。 8:17    因為掩藏的事、沒有不顯出來的．隱瞞的事、沒有不露出來被人知道的。什么时候所有的事都会被公布于众的？ 8:18    所以你們應當小心怎樣聽．因為凡有的、還要加給他．凡沒有的、連他自以為有的、也要奪去。你如何理解“也要夺去”？

NOTES注释

Lamp - In Jesus' day people used small clay lamps that burned olive oil drawn up by a wick
灯 --- 在主耶稣的时代，人们用的是烧橄榄油的小陶油灯。

Jesus' Mother and Brothers耶稣的母亲和弟兄们
    19Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. 20Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you." What did Jesus mother and brothers want?
    21He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."  What does this account teach us about human and spiritual relationships?
8:19    耶穌的母親和他弟兄來了、因為人多、不得到他跟前。 8:20    有人告訴他說、你母親、和你弟兄、站在外邊、要見你。耶稣的母亲和弟兄们想要什么？
8:21    耶穌回答說、聽了　神之道而遵行的人、就是我的母親、我的弟兄了。关于人类在血缘上和属灵上的关系，这件事教导了我们什么？

Jesus Calms the Storm耶稣平静风暴
    22One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." What do you think Jesus had been doing during the day? So they got into a boat and set out. 23As they sailed, he fell asleep. Why was Jesus sleeping? A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. What was the previous occupation of many disciples? Do you think they were ever in storms? Was Jesus experienced in handling a boat?
24The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" Why didn’t Jesus wake up? What was the previous occupation of many disciples? Do you think they were ever in storms? Was Jesus experienced in handling a boat?He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. How quickly was the storm quieted? What were the two storms Jesus calmed? 25"Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. What does this question tell us about the disciples’ faith?
      In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? Why were they afraid and amazed?  He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him." What were the disciples realizing?
8:22    有一天耶穌和門徒上了船、對門徒說、我們可以渡到湖那邊去．你认为耶稣那天都做了什么？他們就開了船。 8:23    正行的時候、耶穌睡著了．耶稣为什么会睡着？湖上忽然起了暴風、船將滿了水、甚是危險。多数门徒以前是从事什么职业的？你认为他们有没有经历过风暴？耶稣是不是很善于驾船？ 8:24    門徒來叫醒了他、說、夫子、夫子、我們喪命啦。耶稣为什么没有醒？你认为他们有没有经历过风暴？耶稣是不是很善于驾船？  耶穌醒了、斥責那狂風大浪．風浪就止住、平靜了。风暴多久才平息？耶稣平静过哪两次风暴？8:25    耶穌對他們說、你們的信心在哪裡呢．耶稣的这个问题告诉了我们门徒的信心是怎么样的？他們又懼怕、又希奇、彼此說、這到底是誰、他们为什么又害怕又希奇？他吩咐風和水、連風和水也聽從他了。门徒们意识到什么？   

NOTES注释

To the other side of the lake – Jesus left the territory of Galilee to go to the region of the Gerasenes.
到湖那边去——耶稣离开加利利地区，来到了格拉森。

Squall came down - Situated in a basin surrounded by mountains, the Sea of Galilee is particularly susceptible to sudden, violent storms. Cool air from the Mediterranean is drawn down through the narrow mountain passes and clashes with the hot, humid air lying over the lake.
起了风暴 --- 加利利海四面环山，地处盆地，特别容易起突如其来的强烈风暴。从地中海来的冷空气透过狭窄的山间隙进入并与湖上湿热的空气交汇（产生强风暴）。

The Healing of a Demon-possessed Man医治好被污鬼附的人
26They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. Locate the region on your map. 27When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. Describe the man. 28When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Do you think the demons recognized Jesus by His name? Why? I beg you, don't torture me!" What did the demons want? 29For Jesus had commanded the evilspirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. What do we learn about the demons' power? Why would they want the man chained?
8:26    他們到了格拉森〔有古卷作加大拉〕人的地方、就是加利利的對面。在地图上找到这个地方。 8:27    耶穌上了岸、就有城裡一個被鬼附著的人、迎面而來、這個人許久不穿衣服、不住房子、只住在墳塋裡。请描述一下这个人。 8:28    他見了耶穌、就俯伏在他面前、大聲喊叫、說、至高　神的兒子耶穌、我與你有甚麼相干．求你不要叫我受苦。你认为这污鬼认出耶稣是谁了吗？为什么？这污鬼想要什么？ 8:29    是因耶穌曾吩咐污鬼從那人身上出來．原來這鬼屢次抓住他、他常被人看守、又被鐵鍊和腳鐐捆鎖、他竟把鎖鍊掙斷、被鬼趕到曠野去。从这里我们知道污鬼有什么样的能力？他们为什么要把这个人用锁链捆住？
    30Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" Why would Jesus ask this question? Surely He knew the name.
   "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him. 31And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. Of what were the demons afraid?
   8:30    耶穌問他說、你名叫甚麼．耶稣为什么要问这个问题？他說、我名叫群．這是因為附著他的鬼多。 8:31    鬼就央求耶穌、不要吩咐他們到無底坑裡去。这些鬼害怕什么？
32A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. What did the evil spirits know that Jesus would not permit? 33When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. For what were the evil spirits responsible?
8:32    那裡有一大群豬、在山上喫食．鬼央求耶穌、准他們進入豬裡去．耶穌准了他們。鬼知道耶稣不许他们做什么？8:33    鬼就從那人出來、進入豬裡去．於是那群豬闖下山崖、投在湖裡淹死了。鬼要为什么负责？
34When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 35and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. What did the people see? Why would they be afraid? 36Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. 37Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. Why do you think the people might be afraid? So he got into the boat and left.
8:34    放豬的看見這事就逃跑了、去告訴城裡和鄉下的人。 8:35    眾人出來要看是甚麼事．到了耶穌那裡、看見鬼所離開的那人、坐在耶穌腳前、穿著衣服、心裡明白過來、他們就害怕。众人看到了什么？他们为什么害怕？ 8:36    看見這事的、便將被鬼附著的人怎麼得救、告訴他們。 8:37    格拉森四圍的人、因為害怕得很、都求耶穌離開他們．你认为众人为什么会害怕？耶穌就上船回去了。
38The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him,  Why? but Jesus sent him away, saying, 39"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. Why would Jesus ask this man to tell others when many times Jesus told those He healed, not to tell anyone?
8:38    鬼所離開的那人、懇求和耶穌同在．为什么？耶穌卻打發他回去、 8:39    說、你回家去、傳說　神為你作了何等大的事．他就去滿城裡傳揚耶穌為他作了何等大的事。许多次耶稣告诉那些祂医治好了的人不要他们把事情告诉别人，为什么这里耶稣要这个人传扬祂的作为？

NOTES注释

Region of the Gerasenes - The east side of the lake, a Jewish territory largely inhabited by Gentiles, as indicated by the presence of the large herd of pigs - animals Jews considered "unclean" and therefore unfit to eat. About 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) south is a fairly steep slope within 40 yards of the shore, and about two miles (3.2 kilometers)from there are cavern tombs that appear to have been used as dwellings.
格拉森 ---位于加利利海的东岸，属于犹太人的领地却大部分由外邦人居住，因为这里养有大群的犹太人认为是“不洁”的猪。格拉森向南约一英里（1.6公里）是一个大陡坡，距离海岸40码，离那里2英里（3.2公里）就是墓穴，可能以前有人住过。

Demon-possessed - People possessed by devils were physically in their power. The people were tormented by them in some peculiar fashion and made to do and say things which they would not have thought of otherwise. The evil spirits that possessed their victims are called "unclean spirits" in other passages; for they fill the heart of man with all manner of sinful thoughts.
被鬼附——被鬼附的人身体是在鬼的控制之下。被鬼附的人以某种特别的方式受着他们的折磨，而且作出或说出他们从没有想过的事。附在人身上的鬼被称为是“不洁的灵”，因为他们在人心里充满各样的恶念。

Lived in the tombs - It was not unusual for the same cave to provide burial for the dead and shelter for the living. Very poor people often lived in such caves.
住在墳塋裡 --- 一般一个洞穴不会既是坟墓又有人居住，只有非常贫困的人才住在这样的洞穴里。
What do you want with me? - Another way of saying "mind your own business".
我與你有甚麼相干--- 也就是说“管你什么事”。
Don't torture me! - The demon sensed that he was to be punished and used the strongest basis for an oath that he knew.
不要叫我受苦 --- 鬼感觉到他要受到惩罚，就发重誓请求。
Legion - A Roman legion was made up of 6,000 men. Here the term suggests that the man was possessed by numerous demons.
群 ---一个古罗马军团由6000人组成。这里用同样的词表示这个人被许多鬼附着。
Pigs - Pigs were unclean to Jews, and eating them was forbidden.
猪——对犹太人来说，猪是不洁的动物，是不允许吃猪肉的。

He gave them permission - Though Jesus seemingly consented to the demons' request, the pigs carried the demons into the depths of the sea.
耶稣准了他们 ---尽管耶稣看起来好像同意了鬼的请求，但这个猪却还是把鬼带入了悬崖。

A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman已死女孩和患病妇人
    40Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. What was the crowd expecting to see? 41Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house 42because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. What does this show Jairus believed?
   As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. 43And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. Why was this bleeding especially difficult for the woman? 44She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. What does this incident tell us about Jesus?
8:40    耶稣回来的时候，众人迎接他，因为他们都等候他。众人在期待什么？ 8:41    有一个管会堂的，名叫睚鲁，来俯伏在耶稣脚前，求耶稣到他家里去。 8:42    因他有一个独生女儿，约有十二岁，快要死了。这表现了睚鲁相信什么？耶稣去的时候，众人拥挤他。 8:43    有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，在医生手里花尽了她一切养生的，并没有一人能医好她。为什么血漏这病会给这女人带来很多困难呢？ 8:44    她来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳绥子 ，血漏立刻就止住了。这件事如何让我们更加认识耶稣？
    45"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. Since Jesus is all-knowing, why would He ask this question?
      When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you." What does this answer tell us about Peter?
    46But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out out from me."
    47Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. Why would the woman tremble?) In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. (What does this tell about the woman?48Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." What was responsible for her healing?
49While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. " Your daughter is dead,”he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore."
8:45    耶稣说，摸我的是谁。既然耶稣无所不知，为什么他还问这个问题？众人都不承认，彼得和同行的人都说，夫子，众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你。彼得的回答反映出他怎样的特性或性格？有古卷在此有你还问摸我的是谁吗？ 8:46    耶稣说，总有人摸我。因我觉得有能力从我身上出去。 8:47    那女人知道不能隐藏，就战战兢兢地来俯伏在耶稣脚前，这个女人为什么战抖？把摸他的缘故，和怎样立刻得好了，当着众人都说出来。女人这样做反映了她是怎样的人？ 8:48    耶稣对她说，女儿，你的信救了你，平平安安地去吧。是什么救了这女人？8:49    还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来说，你的女儿死了，不要劳动夫子。

    50Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed." Think about the previous healing, what was Jesus hoping to hear from Jairus?
51When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. Why would Jesus want witnesses? 52Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.” What is death referred to? Why?
8:50    耶稣听见就对他说，不要怕，只要信，你的女儿就必得救。联想耶稣对血漏女人的医治，在这里耶稣希望从睚鲁那里听到怎样的回答？ 8:51    耶稣到了他的家，除了彼得，约翰，雅各，和女儿的父母，不许别人同他进去。为什么耶稣要彼得，约翰，雅各，和女儿的父母同他一起进去？ 8:52   众人都为这女儿哀哭捶胸。耶稣说，不要哭，他不是死了，是睡着了。这里的死指什么？为什么？

53They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. What were the mourners calling Jesus? 54But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!" 55Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. What does Jesus telling the girl to eat tell us? 56Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. What possible reason would Jesus have for asking His disciples not to tell?
8:53    他们晓得女儿已经死了，就嗤笑耶稣。这些哭丧的人怎样称呼耶稣？ 8:54    耶稣拉着她的手，呼叫说，女儿，起来吧。 8:55    她的灵魂便回来，她就立刻起来了。耶稣吩咐给她东西吃。 耶稣叫着女孩吃东西，这告诉了我们什么样的信息？8:56    她的父母惊奇得很。耶稣嘱咐他们，不要把所作的事告诉人。为什么耶稣让他们不要把这事告诉别人？


NOTES注释

A crowd welcomed him– The majority of people were glad Jesus had returned. It is possible that the people had heard of the healings and were hoping to see more.
众人迎接他--- 大多数人很高兴耶稣回来，可能是因为人们听说耶稣行了医治神迹，并希望看到更多的医治神迹。
Ruler of the synagogue – The ruler was a layman. He was responsible for conducting services, selecting participants and maintaining order. Most synagogues had only one ruler.
管会堂的----管会堂的是一个俗人。他负责主持礼拜的进行，选择参与人员，以及维持秩序。多数会堂都会有一个这样的管理者。
Bleeding – The precise nature of the woman’s problem is not known. She was shunned by people generally, because the hemorrhage had made her ceremonially unclean for 12 years. She was not allowed to worship in the temple.
血漏---这位妇人所患病症的具体情况不为所知。由于12年来血漏一直使她在礼法上不洁，人们一般都会避开她。她不被允许在神殿里崇拜。
No one could heal her – She had gone to many doctors and no one could cure her.
没有一个人能医好她---她已经去看了很多医生，但没有一个人能医好她。
Her bleeding stopped – Her healing was complete. This was an act of faith.
她的血漏立刻停止了--- 她被完全医治了。这是信心的行为。
Who touched Me? – Jesus knew who touched Him but for the woman’s good and for a testimony to the crowd, Jesus insisted that the miracle be made known.
摸我的是谁？---耶稣知道是谁摸了他，但是为了这位妇人好，同时也是给众人的一个见证，耶稣（故意问了这给问题以）揭示这个神迹。
Power has gone out – The woman was healed because God graciously determined to heal her through the power then active in Jesus.
有能力从我身上出去---出于神的恩典，他决定要通过耶稣施能来医治这妇人，这妇人才得到医治。
Seeing that she could not go unnoticed –The woman knew her healing was not a secret to Christ and confessed.
（这妇人）知道她不能隐藏---这个妇人知道她所得到的医治对基督不是一个秘密，所以就全说出来了。

Daughter – A tender address used nowhere else in Jesus recorded words.
女儿---在所记录下来的耶稣的话中，这是唯一一处耶稣用如此亲切的称呼。
Your faith has healed you –Her sins were forgiven and could experience God’s peace. Her health was a reward of grace for the firmness of her trust.
你的信救了你--- 她的罪得到了宽恕，同时她也经历了神给的平安。她身体上的痊愈是因她坚定的信心而得到的恩赐。
Your daughter is dead –The servants told Jairus that his daughter had died. They knew Jesus had healed sick people, but did not think he could raise the dead.
你的女儿死了--- 仆人告诉睚鲁，他的女儿已经死了。他们知道耶稣已经医治过患病的人，但没有想到他能使人从死里复活。

Wailing and mourning – It was customary for professional mourners to be brought in at the time of death. In this case it is not certain that enough time had elapsed for professional mourners to have been secured.
哀 哭 捶 胸--- 在人刚死的时候请专门的人来哭丧是一种习俗。在这里，（我们）并不确定是不是（睚鲁的女儿）已经死了有一段时间，已经请来了专门哭丧的人。
She is not dead but asleep – Jesus wanted Jairus to understand, He had power over death and his daughter was not permanently dead.
他 不 是 死 了 ， 是 睡 着 了---- 耶稣想让睚鲁知道他（耶稣）有超越死亡的能力，他的女儿并没有永久地死亡。
Give her something to eat - She was returned to her health, a complete healing. The girl did not need to regain her health, but was ready to eat.
给 她 东 西 吃---- 她从死里复活了，被完全地医治。这个女孩并不需要（休息疗养）以恢复健康，而她已经可以吃了。

Ordered them not to tell – (1) Jesus did not want to be considered just a miracle worker. (2) His great popularity with the people coupled with the growing opposition from the religious leaders (publicity at this time concerning a raising from the dead) would have been counterproductive to Jesus’ ministry
（耶稣）嘱 咐 他 们 ， 不 要 把 所 作 的 事 告 诉 人 ---- （1）耶稣不想只是被人认为是一个行神迹的人。（2）他在众人中的威望（名气）以及从当时宗教领袖而来的日益增长的（对耶稣的）敌对，这些（包括这时将使人从死里复活的神迹四处传播）会对耶稣的事工有反面的影响。
