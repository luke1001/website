路加福音Luke 7: 1-50
            At the end of the previous chapter, Jesus had stressed the importance of genuine, unshakable faith in Him. In the first two sections, Luke gives us an example of such a faith.
上一章结尾，耶稣强调了在基督里的真实不动摇的信心的重要性。在本章的前两部分，路加给我们举出了这样信心的例子。

The Faith of the Centurion百夫长的信心
                  1When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.Find Capernaum on the map of Israel at Jesus time.2There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.3The centurion heard of JesusHow would a Roman Centurion, a gentile, hear of Jesus – the Jews and Romans didn’t even speak the same language?and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. Why is the friendship between the centurion and elders of the Jews unusual?4When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this, 5because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."Why did the elders want Jesus to come?
              6So Jesus went with them.  He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. 7That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. Why did the Centurion not want Jesus to come? But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 8For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."What else do we learn about the centurion?
9When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." What was Jesus really telling the Jews?10Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. What is remarkable about Jesus' manner of healing the servant? (verses 6 and 10)

7:1    耶稣对百姓讲完了这一切的话，就进了迦百农。（在耶稣在世时期的以色列地图上找到迦百农） 7:2    有一个百夫长所宝贵的仆人，害病快要死了。 7:3    百夫长风闻耶稣的事，（身为一个罗马人，一个外邦人，这个百夫长是如何知道耶稣的？罗马人和犹太人说的不是同一种语言。）就托犹太人的几个长老，去求耶稣来救他的仆人。（为什么从这里可以看出这个百夫长和犹太人长老的关系不同寻常？） 7:4    他们到了耶稣那里，就切切地求他说，你给他行这事，是他所配得的。 7:5    因为他爱我们的百姓，给我们建造会堂。（为什么这几个长老想让耶稣来？）
7:6    耶稣就和他们同去。离那家不远，百夫长托几个朋友去见耶稣，对他说，主阿，不要劳动。因你到我舍下，我不敢当。 7:7    我也自以为不配去见你，只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。（为什么百夫长不想让耶稣来？） 7:8    因为我在人的权下, 也有兵在我以下，对这个说去，他就去。对那个说来，他就来。对我的仆人说，你作这事，他就去作。（从这里，我们还可以看出百夫长的什么品质？）
7:9    耶稣听见这话，就希奇他，转身对跟随的众人说，我告诉你们，这么大的信心，就是在以色列中我也没有遇见过。（在这里，耶稣其实是想告诉犹太人什么？） 7:10    那托来的人回到百夫长家里，看见仆人已经好了。耶稣对仆人的医治有什么非同寻常之处？（第6和10节）

Notes注释：
Capernaum – A thriving city located on the north side of the Sea of Galilee on the great road from Damascus to the Mediterranean Sea
迦百农– 一个坐落在加利利湖北边的繁荣的城市，同时它也在从大马士革通往地中海的主要干线上。

Centurion’s servant – The centurion was a Roman military officer in charge of 100 soldiers. This centurion was probably a member of Herod Antipas’s forces. The Roman centurion referred to showed genuine concern for his slave, and he was admired by the Jews, who spoke favorably of him even though he was a Gentile.
百夫长的仆人 --- 百夫长是掌管100个士兵的罗马军官。这个百夫长很可能是希律·安提帕的军队中的一个军官。在这里所提到的罗马百夫长对他的奴隶表示了真诚的关怀，所以他得到犹太人的尊崇，也因此即使他是外邦人，犹太人也帮他说好话。
Elders of the Jews – Highly respected Jews of the community, though not necessarily rulers of the synagogue. They were willing to come and plead for the centurion.
犹太人的长老--- 在犹太社会中，受到高度尊敬的人。但他们不一定是会堂的掌管者。他们愿意来为百夫长求情。
Synagogue – meeting house or place of worship. Jerusalem had close to 460 synagogues. Public worship began with prayers and benedictions, followed by the reading of the Law. The Books of Moses (first 5 books of the Bible) would be read twice in seven years. After the Law came a reading of the Prophets. Next was the sermon, a theological discussion. Then the services were closed with a short prayer.
会堂--- 是聚会以及崇拜的地方。以色列有将近460所会堂。公共崇拜以祷告和祝祷开始，接以诵读犹太律法。摩西五经（旧约的头五本书）要在7年内读两遍。读完律法，接着要读先知书，下来是讲道，也就是神学上的讨论。最后崇拜以简短的祷告结束。

Amazed – The amazement of Jesus is only mentioned twice. Here because of belief and at Nazareth because of unbelief. (Mark 6:6)
希奇 ----在圣经里只有两处提到耶稣（对事或人）感到希奇。在这里是因为人的信心而希奇，另一处耶稣在拿撒勒对人的不信而希奇（马可福音6：6）
Jesus Raises a Widow's Son耶稣使寡妇之子复活
            11Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain,Find Nain on the map of Israel at Jesus time.and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. Why were the crowds following Jesus?12As he approached the town gate, What is a town gate? a dead person was being carried out – Where do you think they were going? the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. What would Jesus see and hear to tell him this? Why was this especially sad? And a large crowd from the town was with her. 13When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.” What does this account reveal about the caring and power of Jesus? Who does He care about? What kind of power does He have?
            14Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” 15The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. How was this miracle different form the centurion's servant? And how was it alike?16They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” Who did they think Jesus was?What did they fail to realize? they said. “God has come to help his people.” 17This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
7:11    过了不多时，有古卷作次日耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，（在耶稣在世时期的以色列地图上找到拿因）他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。（为什么众人要跟着耶稣同行？） 7:12    将近城门（城门是什么样的？），有一个死人被抬出来。（你认为他们这是要往哪里去？）这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇。（耶稣看到和听到了什么，才让他知道这死人是寡妇的独子？为什么这种情况特别的悲惨？）有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。 7:13    主看见那寡妇就怜悯她，对她说，不要哭。（这个故事让我们如何了解到耶稣对人的关爱和耶稣的能力？祂关心什么？祂有什么样的能力？）
7:14    于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说，少年人，我吩咐你起来。 7:15    那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。（这个神迹与百夫长仆人的神迹有什么不同，以及相似之处？）7:16    众人都惊奇，归荣耀与神说，有大先知在我们中间兴起来了。又说，神眷顾了他的百姓。（在这里，众人认为耶稣是谁？ 他们没有认识到什么？）7:17    他这事的风声就传遍了犹太，和周围地方。


Coffin – The man was probably carried in an open coffin, suggested by Jewish custom and the fact that he sat up in response to Jesus’ command.
（棺）杠--- 根据犹太习俗，以及他听了耶稣的吩咐就坐起来的事实，（我们可以推断）这个寡妇的独子可能被放在敞开的棺材里。
Jesus and John the Baptist耶稣和施洗约翰
18John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, 19he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"  What wise decision does John the Baptist make when struggling with his doubt?
7:18   约翰的门徒把这些事都告诉约翰。 7:19    他便叫了两个门徒来，打发他们到主那里去，说，那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？施洗约翰在疑惑中挣扎时作出了什么有智慧的决定？
20When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?' " What was John the Baptist and his messengers thinking?
7:20    那两个人来到耶稣那里，说，施洗的约翰打发我们来问你，那将要来的是你吗？还是我们等候别人呢？施洗约翰和他的捎信人（他的门徒们）想的是什么？
21At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. 22So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. 23Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me." What comforting and encouraging answer does Jesus send to John?
7:21    正当那时候，耶稣治好了许多有疾病的，受灾患的，被恶鬼附着的。又开恩叫好些瞎子能看见。 7:22    耶稣回答说，你们去把所看见所听见的事告诉约翰。就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。 7:23    凡不因我跌倒的，就有福了。耶稣送给约翰什么让人得安慰和鼓励的回答？
24After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? 25If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. What is Jesus really asking the crowd? 26But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. 27This is the one about whom it is written: " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' How does Jesus commend John's service?
7:24    约翰所差来的人既走了，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说，你们从前出去到旷野，是要看什么呢？要看风吹动的芦苇吗？ 7:25    你们出去到底是要看什么？要看穿细软衣服的人吗？那穿华丽衣服宴乐度日的人，是在王宫里。耶稣实际上是向众人问什么？ 7:26    你们出去究竟是要看什么？要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。 7:27    经上记着说，我要差遣我的使者在你前面，预备道路。所说的就是这个人。耶稣如何称赞约翰的服事？
28I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." How are we to understand Jesus' statement about greatness?
7:28    我告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个大过约翰的。然而神国里最小的比他还大。我们如何来理解耶稣对于大小的说明？
29(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. 30But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)
7:29    众百姓和税吏，既受过约翰的洗，听见这话，就以神为义。7:30    但法利赛人和律法师，没有受过约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。（二十九三十两节或作众百姓和税吏听见了约翰的话就受了他的洗便以神为义但法利赛人和律法师不受约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。）
    31"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? 32They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other:  " 'We played the flute for you,  and you did not dance; we sang a dirge,
and you did not cry.' How were the Pharisees and teachers of the Law like the children when it came to the forgiving grace of God?
    7:31    主又说，这样，我可用什么比这世代的人呢？他们好像什么呢？ 7:32    好像孩童坐在街市上，彼此呼叫说，我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞，我们向你们举哀，你们不啼哭。在讲到神的赦罪恩典时，法利赛人和文士如何就像小孩子一样？
  33For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' What had the people said about John? 34The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners." ' What had the people said about Jesus? 35But wisdom is proved right by all her children." What were spiritually wise people able to tell?
7:33    施洗的约翰来，不吃饼，不喝酒。你们说他是被鬼附着的。人们如何评论约翰？ 7:34    人子来，也吃也喝。你们说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。人们如何评论耶稣？ 7:35    但智慧之子，都以智慧为是。属灵上有智慧的人能辨别什么？

NOTES注释
John's disciples - Despite John the 'Baptist's imprisonment, his disciples kept in contact with him and continued his ministry.
约翰的门徒——尽管施洗约翰被抓入狱，他的门徒们还与他保持联系并继续着他的事工。
Should we expect someone else?" - John had announced the coming of the Christ, but now he himself had been languishing in prison for months. His disappointment was natural. He wanted reassurance - and perhaps also wanted to urge Jesus to further action.
 还是我们等候别人呢 --- 约翰已经宣告了基督的降临，但现在他自己已在监狱里苦等数月了。他失望是很自然的。他想要恢复信心---或者也想要催促耶稣有进一步的行动。
More than a prophet - John was the unique prophet sent to prepare the way for the Messiah.
比先知大多---约翰是独一为弥赛亚预备道路的先知。

One who is least in the kingdom of God - Whoever humbles himself like a child, is regarded by God as even greater than John the Baptist.
神国里最小的 --- 任何一个谦卑自己为小孩子一样的人在神看来就比施洗约翰还大。

Rejected God's purpose - Tax collectors had shown their willingness to repent by accepting John's baptism, whereas the Pharisees showed their rejection of God's message by refusing to be baptized.
废弃了神的旨意---税吏接受约翰的施洗来表示他们愿意悔改，然而法利赛人拒绝受洗以此显示了他们拒绝神的信息。

Like children sitting in the marketplace - People had rejected both John and Jesus, but for different reasons - like children who refuse to play either a joyful game or a mournful one? They would not associate with John when he followed the strictest of rules or with Jesus when he freely associated with all kinds of people.
好像孩童坐在街市上--- 人们拒绝约翰和耶稣，但是不同的原因 --- 就像小孩子拒绝玩一个开心的游戏或一个不开心的游戏? 当约翰严格遵守律例时他们就远离约翰，当耶稣自由地与所有不同的人交往时他们就远离耶稣。
Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman有罪妇人膏抹耶稣
36Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. What do you know about the Pharisee's relationship with Jesus? Why do you think Jesus was invited to dinner? 37When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, 38and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. Why would this woman kiss Jesus feet and pour perfume on them? What has this woman experienced that caused this expression?
7:36    有一个法利赛人，请耶稣和他吃饭。耶稣就到法利赛人家里去坐席。 对于法利赛人和耶稣的关系你都知道什么？你认为耶稣为什么被邀请去吃饭？7:37    那城里有一个女人，是个罪人。知道耶稣在法利赛人家里坐席，就拿着盛香膏的玉瓶， 7:38    站在耶稣背后，挨着他的脚哭，眼泪湿了耶稣的脚，就用自己的头发擦干，又用嘴连连亲他的脚，把香膏抹上。这个妇人为什么亲耶稣的脚还在上面抹香膏？这个妇人经历了什么使得她有这样的行为？
39When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner." What was the Pharisee thinking about this woman?
7:39    请耶稣的法利赛人看见这事，心里说，这人若是先知，必知道摸他的是谁，是个怎样的女人，乃是个罪人。法利赛人如何想这个妇人？
    40Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."
      "Tell me, teacher," he said.
    41"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"
43Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled."
      "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
7:40    耶稣对他说，西门，我有句话要对你说。西门说，夫子，请说。
7:41    耶稣说，一个债主，有两个人欠他的债。一个欠五十两银子，一个欠五两银子。
7:42    因为他们无力偿还，债主就开恩免了他们两个人的债。这两个人哪一个更爱他呢？
7:43    西门回答说，我想是那多得恩免的人。耶稣说，你断的不错。
    44Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? Who does Jesus want Simon to focus on?I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. 46You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. 47Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little." What was Jesus trying to help Simon understand?
   7:44    于是转过来向着那女人，便对西门说，你看见这女人吗？耶稣要西门关注谁？我进了你的家，你没有给我水洗脚。但这女人用眼泪湿了我的脚，用头发擦干。 7:45    你没有与我亲嘴，但这女人从我进来的时候，就不住地用嘴亲我的脚。 7:46    你没有用油抹我的头，但这女人用香膏抹我的脚。 7:47    所以我告诉你，他许多的罪都赦免了。因为他的爱多。但那赦免少的，他的爱就少。耶稣想要西门了解什么？
    48Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
    49The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
50Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." What saved the woman?
7:48    于是对那女人说，你的罪赦免了。
7:49    同席的人心里说，这是什么人，竟赦免人的罪呢？
7:50    耶稣对那女人说，你的信救了你，平平安安地回去吧。什么救了这妇人？


NOTES注释
A sinful life - Probably a prostitute
罪人 ---可能是一个妓女

Her hair - The hair is a woman's crowning glory. But it was used as a towel on the feet of Jesus.
自己的头发 ---头发是一个女人至高的荣耀。但如毛巾一样被用在耶稣的脚上。

Water for my feet -  The minimal gesture of hospitality.
给我水洗脚 ----以示友好的最低标准
