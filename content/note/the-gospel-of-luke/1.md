路加福音 Luke 2:1-52
Luke 2:1-20 tells of the birth of Jesus. Luke is the only Gospel writer who relates the account of Jesus' birth to dates of would history. Caesar Augustus was the Roman emperor from 31 BC to 14 AD. Having replaced the republic with an imperial form of government, he expanded the empire to include the entire Mediterranean world, established the famed Pax Romana (Roman Peace) and ushered in the golden age of Roman literature and architecture. Augustus (which means “exalted”) was a title voted to him by the Roman senate in 27 B. C.
路加福音2：1-20讲的是主耶稣的降生。四本福音书中只有路加福音将主耶稣的降生与当时的历史背景相联系。该撒亚古士督于公元前31年到公元14年执政罗马帝国。他用君主帝王制代替了共和制来治理罗马，并扩张版图将整个地中海归入到罗马帝国，建立了著名的“罗马和平”并开启了罗马文学和建筑上的黄金时代。公元前27年罗马参议院将该撒亚古（有“被高举”的意思）这个名号选封给了他。
The Birth of Jesus主耶稣的降生
            (1) In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (2) (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) (3) And everyone went to his own town to register. How often does a census take place where you live?
2:1当那些日子，该撒亚古士督有旨意下来，叫天下人民都报名上册。2:2这是居里扭作叙利亚巡抚的时候，头一次行报名上册的事。2:3众人各归各城，报名上册。在你居住的地方多久会有一次人口普查？
            (4) So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. (5) He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. (6) While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, (7) and she gave birth to her first born, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. Luke emphasizes the lowliness of humbleness of Jesus' birth. List some examples of lowliness in vs. 1-7
2:4约瑟也从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去，到了大卫的城，名叫伯利恒，因他本是大卫一族一家的人。2:5要和他所聘之妻马利亚，一同报名上册。那时马利亚的身孕已经重了。2:6他们在那里的时候，马利亚的产期到了。2:7就生了头胎的儿子，用布包起来，放在马槽里，因为客店里没有地方。路加强调了耶稣降生在卑微之地。请列出在1到7节中体现了耶稣降生的低微之处。
            (8) And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. (9) An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. (10) But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. (11) Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. (12) This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” What wonderful news do the angels give to the shepherds about Jesus? If you were a shepherd, what would you be thinking?
2:8在伯利恒之野地里有牧羊的人，夜间按着更次看守羊群。2:9有主的使者站在他们旁边，主的荣光四面照着他们。牧羊的人就甚惧怕。2:10那天使对他们说，不要惧怕，我报给你们大喜的信息，是关乎万民的。2:11因今天在大卫的城里，为你们生了救主，就是主基督。2:12你们要看见一个婴孩，包着布，卧在马槽里，那就是记号了。天使向牧羊人宣布了什么关于耶稣的好消息？如果你是当时在场的一个牧羊人，（听到了这个好消息）你会怎么想？
            (13) Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, (14) “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.” Why is this message comforting?
2:13忽然有一大队天兵，同那天使赞美神说，2:14在至高之处荣耀归与神，在地上平安归与他所喜悦的人。（有古卷作喜悦归与人）。为什么这个好消息（14节）给人以安慰？
            (15) When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” What do the shepherds realize?
            2:15众天使离开他们升天去了，牧羊的人彼此说，我们往伯利恒去，看看所成的事，就是主所指示我们的。牧羊人意识到了什么？
(16) So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. (17) When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, (18) and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. (19) But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. Describe one thing you have treasured.  (20) The Shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. What can we learn about observing the birth of Jesus from the actions of the shepherds and Mary?
2:16他们急忙去了，就寻见马利亚和约瑟，又有那婴孩卧在马槽里。2:17既然看见，就把天使论这孩子的话传开了。2:18凡听见的，就诧异牧羊之人对他们所说的话。2:19马利亚却把这一切的事存在心里，反复思想。请举出一件你珍存的事。2:20牧羊的人回去了，因所听见所看见的一切事，正如天使向他们所说的，就归荣耀与神，赞美他。从马利亚和牧羊人的行动中我们可以了解到见证主耶稣的降生是怎么样的？

NOTES注释
Census – An official counting of all the people. Used for military service and taxation. Jews, however, were exempt from Roman military service.
报名上册 --- 官方的人口普查，为了服兵役和收税的目的。当时，犹太人不用服罗马的兵役。

Entire Roman world – at the time of Jesus birth
天下人民 --- 耶稣降生时整个罗马帝国的人民
Quirinius – This official was possibly in office for two terms, first 6-4 B.C. and then A.D. 6-9. A census is associated with each term.
居里扭 --- 这位官员可能在职两任，一任从公元前6到4年，另一任从公元6到9年。每一任都有一次人口普查。
Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem – See map from study 1. Bethlehem, the town where David was born, was at least a three-day trip from Nazareth.
从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去，到了大卫的城，名叫伯利恒 ---- 参考路加福音第一章笔记里的地图。伯利恒，是大卫出生的地方，距拿撒勒至少有三天的路程。
With Mary – Mary too was of the house of David and probably was required to enroll. In Syria, the Roman province in which Palestine was located, women 12 years of age and older were required to pay poll tax and therefore to register.
和他所聘之妻马利亚 --- 马利亚也是大卫的子孙，可能也要报名上册。在叙利亚，罗马的一个省（巴勒斯坦也属这个省），12岁和12岁以上的女子都要交税，因此她们也要报名上册。
Cloths – Strips of cloth were regularly used to wrap a new born infant.
布 --- 用来包裹新生儿的布条。
Manger – The feeding trough of the animals. This is the only indication that Christ was born in a stable. Very early tradition suggests that it was a cave, perhaps used as a stable, a mark of lowliness.
马槽--- 牲口的饲料槽。这是圣经中唯一一处证明基督是在马棚里出生的经文。早期传统认为那是一个洞穴，可能被用作马棚，是卑微的标志。
Living out in the fields – Does not necessarily mean it was summer, the dry season. The flocks reserved for temple sacrifice were kept in the fields near Bethlehem throughout the year.
在野地里 ---并没有表明当时是夏天，旱季。为圣殿献祭用的羔羊整年都被放养在伯利恒郊外的野地里。
Do not be afraid – Fear was the common reaction to angelic appearances, and encouragement was needed.
不要惧怕 --- 看到天使就会害怕，这是很普遍的反应。所以天使第一句话就说要他们不要惧怕。
A Savior – Many Jews were looking for a political leader to deliver them from Roman rule, while others were hoping for a savior to deliver them from sickness and physical hardship. But this announcement concerns the Savior who would deliver from sins and death.
救主 --- 许多犹太人都在期待一个政治上的领袖来带领他们从罗马的统治当中解放出来，还有许多犹太人盼望一个救主能将他们从疾病和劳苦当中解救出来。但是这位救主是要将人从罪和死亡当中解救出来。
Christ – “the Messiah” and “the Christ” both mean “the Anointed One”
基督 --- “弥赛亚”和“基督”指的都是“受膏者”
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.” – This brief hymn is called the Gloria in Excelsis Deo. The angels recognized the glory and majesty of God by giving praise to him. Peace is not assured to all, but only to those pleasing to God. The Roman world was experiencing the Pax Romana, marked by external tranquility. But the angels proclaimed a deeper, more lasting peace that that – a peace of mind and soul made possible by the Savior. The Messiah was called “Prince of Peace”.
“在至高之处荣耀归与神，在地上平安归与他所喜悦的人” --- 这首诗歌名叫荣归主颂。天使赞美神并归荣耀与神。不是所有的人都有平安，只有那些神所喜悦的人才得平安。当时罗马正值“罗马和平”，国家安泰没有外患。但是天使宣布了一个更深层的，更持久的和平 --- 就是救主成就的灵里的平安。弥赛亚被称为是“和平之子”。
They hurried off – They were eager to see the Christ Child, the desire of their believing hearts.
他们急忙去了 --- 他们急切地想要见到基督婴孩，因为他们心里相信，所以才有这样的渴望。
They spread the word – Told the inhabitants of Bethlehem as well as the strangers that had come there on account of the enrollment.
话传开了 --- 告诉了伯利恒的居民以及那些来报名上册的外地人。

Were amazed – Most of the people probably did not believe the good tidings; The Messiah, the Great King, born in that little town of Bethlehem – and in a manger?
诧异 --- 多数人可能不会相信这个好消息；弥赛亚，大君王，会出生在伯利恒这个小镇，而且是在马槽里？

Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart – Her mind dwelt on those things with great delight; she meditated on them again and again, and compared the angel’s message as told by the shepherds with what she had heard from the angel Gabriel.
马利亚却把这一切的事存在心里，反复思想 --- 她满心欢喜地思想着这些事；她反复思想，并将牧羊人讲的天使宣布的好消息与天使加百列告诉她的相联系。

Jesus Circumcision and Presentation

            (21) On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived. (22) When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (23) as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”), (24) and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.” In what ways did Joseph and Mary obey God?
2:21满了八天，就给孩子行割礼，与他起名叫耶稣，这就是没有成胎以前，天使所起的名。2:22按摩西律法满了洁净的日子，他们带着孩子上耶路撒冷去，要把他献与主。2:23（正如主的律法上所记，凡头生的男子，必称圣归主。）2:24又要照主的律法上所说，或用一对班鸠，或用两只雏鸽献祭。约瑟和马利亚是如何顺服神的？
            (25) Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. What are we told about Simeon? What are we not told? What does it mean to be righteous? to be devout?  He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. (26) It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before had seen the Lord’s Christ. What special honor would Simeon have? Does it Say Simeon would die after seeing the child? (27) Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, (28) Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
2:25在耶路撒冷有一个人名叫西面，这人又公义又虔诚，从这里我们知道西面是一个什么样的人？关于西面，这里没有告诉我们什么？公义指的是什么意思？虔诚指的又是什么意思？素常盼望以色列的安慰者来到，又有圣灵在他身上。2:26他得了圣灵的启示，知道自己未死以前，必看见主所立的基督。西面有什么特别的荣幸？是不是说西面在看到这个孩子之后就会死？2:27他受了圣灵的感动，进入圣殿。正遇见耶稣的父母抱着孩子进来，要照律法的规矩办理。2:28西面就用手接过他来，称颂神说，

(29) “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant
in peace. What kind of peace? (30) For my eyes have seen your salvation, Of what was Simeon sure? (31) which you have prepared in the sight of all people, (32) a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.” For whom did Jesus come? Why do we need light?
2:29主阿，如今可以照你的话，释放仆人安然去世。什么样的平安？2:30因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩。西面心里确信什么？2:31就是你在万民面前所预备的。2:32是照亮外邦人的光，又是你民以色列的荣耀。耶稣为谁而来？我们为什么需要光照？

            (33) The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. What are Joseph and Mary realizing? (34) Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, What does Simeon mean? and to be a sign that will be spoken against, (35) so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. What kind of thoughts will be revealed? And a sword will pierce your own soul too.” How can a sword pierce someone’s soul?
2:33孩子的父母，因这论耶稣的话就希奇。约瑟和马利亚意识到了什么？2:34西面给他们祝福，又对孩子的母亲马利亚说，这孩子被立，是要叫以色列中许多人跌倒，许多人兴起。西面指的是什么意思？又要作毁谤的话柄。叫许多人心里的意念显露出来。什么样的意念要显露出来？你自己的心也要被刀刺透。刀如何可以刺透人的灵魂？
            (36) There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. Explain what it meant to be a prophetess. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, (37) and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. Why did Anna fast and pray? (38) Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. What did Anna realize? Who did she tell?
2:36又有女先知名叫亚拿，是亚设支派法内力的女儿，请解释一下什么是女先知？年纪已经老迈，从作童女出嫁的时候，同丈夫住了七年，就寡居了。2:37现在已经八十四岁，（或作就寡居了八十四年）并不离开圣殿，禁食祈求，昼夜事奉神。亚拿为什么禁食祈求？2:38正当那时，她进前来称谢神，将孩子的事，对一切盼望耶路撒冷得救赎的人讲说。亚拿意识到了什么？她告诉了谁？

            (39) When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. (40) And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. How did Jesus grow physically? How did Jesus grow spiritually?
What are ways you can tell other people about Jesus?
2:39约瑟和马利亚，照主的律法，办完了一切的事，就回加利利，到自己的城拿撒勒去了。2:40孩子渐渐长大，强健起来，充满智慧。又有神的恩在他身上。耶稣身体上如何成长？灵里如何成长？你如何来向别人传讲主耶稣？

NOTES注释

Circumcise – At 8 days of age, the foreskin of male babies was cut off at a religious ceremony. Circumcision signified commitment to the Lord; that the Lord alone would be his God, whom he would trust and serve. Jesus was formally declared to be a member of the Jewish race and Jewish Church.
行割礼 --- 出生后第八天，男婴的包皮要在一个宗教仪式上被割去。割礼象征着对神的承诺，就是承认唯有耶和华才是他的神，是他信靠和服事的神。耶稣被正式宣布成为犹太人以及犹太教会中的一员。

Their purification – Following the birth of a son, the mother had to wait 40 days before going to the temple to offer sacrifice for her purification. If she could not afford a lamb and a pigeon (or dove) then two pigeons (or doves) would be acceptable. Mary would enter the Temple through the “gate of the first-born”. She then proceeded to the highest step of the stairway which led from the Court of the Women to the Court of Israel. Here a priest took the sacrifice from her hand and made the offering. She was then sprinkled with the blood to indicate the cleansing. Finally she paid five pieces of silver into the Temple treasury, placing the money into one of the trumpet-shaped treasure-boxes which stood in the Court of the Women
洁净--- 生产男婴后满40天，母亲要到圣殿里献祭来洁净自己。如果她自己买不起一只羊羔和一只鸽子，两只鸽子也是可以的。马利亚要从“长子之门”进入到圣殿。然后，她会顺着连接妇女堂与色列堂的台阶走到最高处的高台。在这高台上，一位祭司会从她手里接过祭物并将其献上。接着，祭司会将祭物的鲜血洒在她身上，以此来洁净她。最后，她要向圣殿财务部交纳五银，并要将这钱放入妇女堂中的一个喇叭状的钱箱内。
To Jerusalem – The distance from Bethlehem to Jerusalem was only about 5 miles (9 kilometers).
上耶路撒冷 --- 从伯利恒到耶路撒冷大约有5英里（9公里）。
Present him to the Lord – The firstborn of both man and animal were to be dedicated to the Lord. The animals were sacrificed, but the human beings were to serve God throughout their lives. The Levites actually served in the place of all the firstborn males in Israel.
把他献与主 --- 人与牲畜的头生（第一个孩子）都要献给神。头生的牲畜要用来宰杀献祭，但人的头生要一生服事神。实际上，利未人就是替代所有以色列头生的男子来服事神。
Consolation of Israel – The Messiah would bring consolation or comfort to his people at his coming.
以色列的安慰者---当弥赛亚来的时候，他会为他的子民带来安慰。
Spirit was upon him – Simeon was given a special insight by the Spirit so that he would recognize the ‘Christ.”
圣灵在他身上--- 圣灵给了西面一个特别的意象，所以他可以认出“基督”。
Gentiles – A person who is not Jewish.
外邦人 --- 犹太人以外的人通称为外邦人。
Child’s father – Joseph was Jesus’ legal father.
孩子的父 ---约瑟是耶稣法律上的父亲。
Falling and rising of many in Israel – Christ rises up those who believe in him, but is a stumbling block for those who disbelieve.
以色列中许多人跌倒，许多人兴起 ---- 基督要兴起所有信他的人，但对于不信他的人，他是他们的绊脚石。
Sword will pierce your own soul too - Mary, as well as Jesus, would suffer deep anguish. This is the first reference in the Gospel of Luke to Christ’s suffering and death.
你自己的心也要被刀刺透 --- 马利亚，以及耶稣，都会受到极大的痛苦。这是在路加福音中第一处提到基督受难和死亡的地方。
Anna – The name means “gracious”. Anna praised God for the child Jesus.
亚拿 --- 这个名字有“亲切的”的意思。亚拿为耶稣婴孩向神献上赞美。
Never left the temple – Herod’s temple was quite large and included rooms for various uses, and Anna may have been allowed to live in one of them. This statement probably means that she spent her waking hours attending and worshiping in the temple.
并不离开圣殿 --- 希律王建的圣殿非常大，有许多不同用途的屋子，亚拿就住在其中的一间屋子里。这句话可能是指她全天都在圣殿里作崇拜来侍奉主。
Returned to Galilee – Luke, the writer, does not mention the Magi or the flight to and return from Egypt.
回加利利 --- 路加，路加福音的作者，没有提到（从东方来朝见耶稣的）博士，以及约瑟和马利亚带着耶稣婴孩逃往埃及与离开埃及的经历。
The Boy Jesus in the Temple童子耶稣在殿中
            (41) Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. (42) When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. What are some places that you travel to every year? (43) After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. (44) Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Who else traveled with Mary and Joseph? Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. (45) When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. (46) After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. What was unusual about finding Jesus in the temple?  (47) Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. What was unusual about Jesus answers? (48) When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” What does Mary’s question tell us? What do you think Mary was feeling when Jesus was missing?
2:41    每年到逾越节，他父母就上耶路撒冷去。 2:42    当他十二岁的时候，他们按着节期的规矩上去。 你每年都去哪里旅行？2:43    守满了节期，他们回去，孩童耶稣仍旧在耶路撒冷。他的父母并不知道。 2:44    以为他在同行的人中间，走了一天的路程，还有谁与马利亚和约瑟一起同行？就在亲族和熟识的人中找他。 2:45    既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。 2:46    过了三天，就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。 为什么在殿中找到耶稣，这很奇怪？2:47    凡听见他的，都希奇他的聪明，和他的应对。耶稣的应对有什么不寻常之处？ 2:48    他父母看见就很希奇。他母亲对他说，我儿，为什么向我们这样行呢？看哪，你父亲和我伤心来找你。马利亚的回答告诉了我们什么？你认为当耶稣失踪的时候马利亚是什么样的感受？你是否曾迷失过？

            (49) “Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?” What is Jesus telling Joseph and Mary?  (50) But they did not understand what he was saying to them. Can you think of some reasons why they wouldn’t understand? (51) Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. Why would Mary want to remember this incidence? (52) And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
2:49    耶稣说，为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗？（或作岂不知我应当在我父的家里吗）耶稣在对约瑟和马利亚说什么？（耶稣这句话的意思是什么？） 2:50    他所说的这话，他们不明白。你知道为什么他们不明白耶稣说的话？ 2:51    他就同他们下去，回到拿撒勒。并且顺从他们。他母亲把这一切的事都存在心里。马利亚为什么要把这一切的事都记在心里？ 2:52    耶稣的智慧和身量，（身量或作年纪）并神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。

NOTES注释
Feast of the Passover – Annual attendance at three feasts by all adult males (normally accompanied by their families) was commanded in the law: Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. Distance prevented many from attending all three, but most Jews tried to be at Passover.
逾越节 ---- 律法中规定所有男性成年人（一般他们的家人也会陪伴参加）每年必须参加的三个祭礼：逾越节，五旬节，住棚节。由于旅途遥远，许多人不能参加所有三个祭礼，但是多数犹太人都会参加逾越节。
Twelve years old – At age 12 boys began preparing to take their places in the religious community the following year.
十二岁 ---- 男孩子从十二岁就要开始为将来在宗教社会中的服事而作准备了。
Three days – One day traveling away from Jerusalem, a second traveling back and a third looking for him.
三天 --- 离开耶路撒冷（的圣殿）后一天才发现耶稣不见了，立刻返回耶路撒冷又花了一天的时间，最后一天时间是在耶路撒冷里寻找耶稣。
In my Father’s house – Jesus pointed to his personal duty to his Father in heaven. At 12 years of age he was aware of his unique relationship to God. But he was also obedient to his earthly parents.
以我父的事为念 --- 耶稣将他所有的心思意念都放在天父那里（他这里指的是天父差他来世上要做的事）。在他十二岁时，他就已经认识到他与神之间的特别的关系。但他对他在世上的父母也很顺服。
Jesus grew – Although Jesus was God there is no indication that he had all knowledge and wisdom from birth. He seems to have matured like any other boy.
耶稣长大 --- 尽管耶稣是神，但是没有迹象（或证据）表明他从一出世就是全知全能。他好像同别的男孩一样也是渐渐成长成熟的。
This is the only recorded incidence in Jesus life until He begins His public ministry.
这是唯一一处记载下来的耶稣在他开始对外事工（公众事工）前的经历。
Question
If people could only know one thing about you during your non-adult life, what should they know?
如果大家只能知道一件你在未成年时发生的事情， 这件事会是什么？
