            In the preceding chapter, Jesus laid out the immense love God has towards sinners. This section is addressed to His disciples, a number of whom were previously tax collectors and involved in immoral actions. Now they must be instructed in the proper attitude toward earthly treasures.
            在前一章里，耶稣展现了神向罪人所有的大爱。这一部分是向着耶稣的门徒说的，这些门徒曾经是税吏或是在不道德的事上有份的。现在他们必须被教导从而正确的对待世上的财物。
            The parable begins with the master accusing his manager of squandering the master's possessions. Although it is clear that the master fires the manager, he does not have him arrested or punished in any way. The master is a merciful man. The manager counts on this mercy as he decides on a solution to his problem. The parable ends with the master commending the manager not for his dishonesty, but for his shrewdness.   As children of the light we should use wise methods to win others for Christ.
            这个比喻开始于一个财主责备他的管家浪费主人的财产。尽管我们清楚的看到财主辞退了管家，但他并没有拘捕或是惩罚这个管家。财主是个仁慈的人。管家依赖于这样的仁慈，谋划出解决自己问题的办法。比喻以财主夸奖管家结束，但并不是因为管家的不诚实而是为他做事聪明。作为光明之子我们当用智慧的办法来为基督赢得他人。
            For the servant of God, money may be used for Godly purposes. When money becomes a master it cannot help but threaten loyalty to God. Guard against becoming enslaved to wealth; use money for godly and eternal purposes.
            对于神的仆人来说，钱财可能被用于属神的目的。但钱财成为了主人的时候，它将不仅没有帮助还会威胁到对神的忠诚。警醒保守自己不要被财富奴役；使用钱财在属神的和有永恒目的的事上。

The Parable of the Shrewd Manager不义的管家
 1 Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. Of what was the manager accused? 2 So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’ What is going to happen to the manager?
 1 耶稣又对门徒说：「有一个财主的管家，别人向他主人告他浪费主人的财物。管家因为什么而被控告？2 主人叫他来，对他说：『我听见你这事怎么样呢？把你所经管的交代明白，因你不能再作我的管家。』管家将要怎样？
   3 “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg— What do we learn about the manager? Whose wellbeing is the manager interested in?4 I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’ What is the manager's plan to solve his problem? Does the manager wish to reform his ways?
3 那管家心里说：『主人辞我，不用我再作管家，我将来做什么？锄地呢？无力；讨饭呢？怕羞。我们对这个管家有怎样的了解？这个管家关心谁的福利？4 我知道怎么行，好叫人在我不作管家之后，接我到他们家里去。』管家解决自己问题的计划是什么？管家是否有意改正自己的行为？
   5 “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
   6 “‘Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied.
   “The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’
   7 “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’
   “‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied.
   “He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’
   8 “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. What does Jesus commend? What is not commended? For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. Who are the people of the world? the people of the light? 9 I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. What type of friends?How will using worldly gain be welcomed?
5于是把欠他主人债的，一个一个地叫了来，问头一个说：『你欠我主人多少？』6 他说：『一百篓油。』管家说：『拿你的帐，快坐下，写五十。』7 又问一个说：『你欠多少？』他说：『一百石麦子。』管家说：『拿你的帐，写八十。』8 主人就夸奖这不义的管家做事聪明；耶稣夸奖的是什么？没有夸奖什么？因为今世之子，在世事之上，较比光明之子更加聪明。谁是今世之子？光明之子？9 我又告诉你们，要借着那不义的钱财结交朋友，到了钱财无用的时候，他们可以接你们到永存的帐幕里去。什么样的朋友？怎样借着不义的钱财结交会被迎接？
   10 “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. What can we learn about a person's character? 11 So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? What are true riches? 12 And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own? What point is Jesus making?
   13 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.” What does it mean to serve God? to serve money?
 14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 15 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight. What does Jesus know about the Pharisees? What did the Pharisees value? What is Jesus response?
10 人在最小的事上忠心，在大事上也忠心；在最小的事上不义，在大事上也不义。关于人的品质我们学习到了什么？11 倘若你们在不义的钱财上不忠心，谁还把那真实的钱财托付你们呢？什么是真实的钱财？12 倘若你们在别人的东西上不忠心，谁还把你们自己的东西给你们呢？耶稣要说明什么？
13 一个仆人不能事奉两个主；不是恶这个爱那个，就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉　神，又事奉玛门。」事奉神、事奉玛门是什么意思？
14 法利赛人是贪爱钱财的；他们听见这一切话，就嗤笑耶稣。15 耶稣对他们说：「你们是在人面前自称为义的，你们的心，　神却知道；因为人所尊贵的，是　神看为可憎恶的。耶稣对法利赛人有怎样的了解？法利赛人尊贵什么？耶稣是如何回应的？

Additional Teachings附加的教导
    16 “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Now what will be proclaimed? Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. What is meant by "forcing their way into it"? 17 It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. Why did Jesus come? Why didn't Jesus come?
   18 “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. What did God intend for marriage?
16 律法和先知到约翰为止，从此什么将被传讲？从此　神国的福音传开了，人人努力要进去。“人人努力要进去”是什么意思？17 天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。耶稣为什么要来？耶稣为什么不来？18 凡休妻另娶的就是犯奸淫；娶被休之妻的也是犯奸淫。」神对婚姻的意旨是什么？
Notes注释
John - The ministry of John the Baptist, which prepared the way for Jesus, was the dividing line between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
约翰–施洗约翰的事工，是为耶稣预备道路，这是旧约和新约的分界线。

            Jesus continues to address the Pharisees with a parable to illustrate that one cannot serve God and money. The rich man's sin was not having money but "the love of money".
            耶稣继续向法利赛人讲比喻来说明人不能同时事奉神和钱财。财主的不是拥有钱财而是“贪爱钱财”

The Rich Man and Lazarus财主和拉撒路
19 “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. Is there anything wrong with how the rich man lived in verse 19? How would you live in luxury? 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores How did Lazarus get to the gate? 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. What kind of dogs were these? What is wrong with the rich man? Why isn't the rich man given a name?
16:19    有一个财主，穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服，天天奢华宴乐。19节中的这个财主的生活有什么不对的吗？如果是你的话，你会怎么样来奢华享乐？  16:20    又有一个讨饭的，名叫拉撒路，浑身生疮，被人放在财主门口，拉撒路是怎么来到财主门口的？  16:21    要得财主桌子上掉下来的零碎充饥。并且狗来舔他的疮。这是什么狗？这个财主做错了什么？为什么这里没有给出财主的名字？

   22 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. Was the beggar given a proper burial? Whom did the angels take to heaven? The rich man also died and was buried. What happened to the rich man when he died? What did the rich man take with him when he died? 23 In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. What do you think the rich man was thinking? 24 So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’ How did the rich man address Abraham? What is the rich man claiming? Who is the rich man concerned about? What had the rich man refused to give Lazarus?
16:22    后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。这个讨饭的有没有得到好的埋葬？天使把谁带到天堂去了？财主也死了，并且埋葬了。财主死后是如何处置的？财主死后，有没有把什么跟着一起带走？  16:23    他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里。  你认为此时财主在想什么？16:24    就喊着说，我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧，打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头。因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。财主如何称呼亚伯拉罕？财主对亚伯拉罕作了什么请求？财主在为谁担心？财主以前拒绝给予拉撒路什么？

 25 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. Is it wrong to have good things in life? What is wrong? How is Lazarus comforted?  26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’ What cannot change at death?
16:25    亚伯拉罕说，儿阿，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦。如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。生活中享有福分，这有没有错？那财主哪里做错了？拉撒路得到了怎样的安慰？  16:26    不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边，是不能的，要从那边过到我们这边，也是不能的。什么是在死后不能改变的？

   27 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ Who does the rich man want to go to his relatives? What is the rich man finally showing? What did the rich man want?
   29 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’
   30 “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’ What had the rich man failed to listen to? What does the rich man want?
   31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’” What is the only way his brothers can be saved?
16:27    财主说，我祖阿，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去。  16:28    因为我还有五个弟兄。他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。财主想要谁到他的父家去？财主最后表现出了什么？财主想要什么？  16:29    亚伯拉罕说，他们有摩西和先知的话，可以听从。  16:30    他说，我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的。若有一个从死里复活的，到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。财主死前没有听谁的话？财主想要什么？  16:31    亚伯拉罕说，若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。什么才是财主的兄弟得救的唯一途径？
