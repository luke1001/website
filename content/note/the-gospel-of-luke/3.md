路加福音 Luke 4:1-44
            Jesus temptations help us understand that Jesus would not accomplish His earthly mission by using His supernatural power for His own needs (first temptation); He would not use His power to win a large followings by miracles or magic (second temptation); He would not compromise with Satan (third temptation). Jesus temptation was real, not merely symbolic. He was confronted by the tempter with a real opportunity to sin. Jesus met all three temptations with Scripture (the Old Testament).
耶稣受试探帮助我们认识到耶稣不会用他的超能力来满足他自己的需要（第一个试探）也不会用他的超能力来完成他在世的事工；他不会用他的能力行神迹来赢得大群的追随者（第二个试探）；他也不会向撒旦妥协（第三个试探）。耶稣受试探是真实的，不是象征性的。他面对试探者，真是有可能会犯罪的。耶稣用圣经（旧约经文）回复了这三个试探。

The Temptation of Jesus (see note)耶稣受试探（见笔记）
 1Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, 2where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. What does it mean to be tempted? Have you been tempted by the devil? He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.
4:1耶稣被圣灵充满，从约但河回来，圣灵将他引到旷野，四十天受魔鬼的试探。什么是受试探？你有没有受过魔鬼的试探？4:2那些日子没有吃什么。日子满了，他就饿了。
 3The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread." What two things was Satan asking Jesus?
4:3魔鬼对他说，你若是神的儿子，可以吩咐这块石头变成食物撒旦问耶稣哪两件事？
 4Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone." What does it mean to live on God’s Word?
4:4耶稣回答说，经上记着说，人活着不是单靠食物，乃是靠神口里所出的一切话 靠神的话活着指的是什么意思？
5The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 6And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 7So if you worship me, it will all be yours." Why does Satan no longer use the words “If you are the son of God”? What is Satan claiming by offering Jesus the kingdoms of the world?
4:5魔鬼又领他上了高山，霎时间把天下的万国都指给他看。4:6对他说，这一切权柄荣华，我都要给你。因为这原是交付我的，我愿意给谁就给谁。4:7你若在我面前下拜，这都要归你。为什么撒旦不再说“如果你是神的儿子”？撒旦要将天下的万国拿出给耶稣，他是在声称什么？
 8Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'
 9The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here. Why was this a temptation? 10For it is written:
   " 'He will command his angels concerning you
      to guard you carefully;
4:8耶稣说，经上记着说，当拜主你的神，单要事奉他。4:9魔鬼又领他到耶路撒冷去，叫他站在殿顶上，（顶原文作翅）对他说，你若是神的儿子，可以从这里跳下去。这为什么是一个试探？4:10因为经上记着说，主要为你吩咐他的使者保护你。
 11they will lift you up in their hands,
      so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'
 12Jesus answered, "It says: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' Think of an example of what it means to put God to the test?
 13When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time. Where does the supreme test?
4:11他们要用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。
4:12耶稣对他说，经上说，不可试探主你的神。请举出一个试探神的例子。
4:13魔鬼用完了各样的试探，就暂时离开耶稣。最大的试探在哪里？

Notes注释
The Temptation of Jesus - The sequence of the second and third temptations differs in Matthew and Luke. Matthew probably followed the chronological order, since at the end of the mountain temptation (Matthew's third) Jesus told Satan to leave (Mt. 4:10). To emphasize a certain point the Gospel writers often bring various events together, not intending to give chronological sequence. Perhaps Luke's focus here is geographical, as he concludes with Jerusalem.
耶稣受试探 --- 第二个和第三个试探的先后顺序在马太福音和路加福音里是不一样的。马太可能是根据他们发生的时间而排序的，因为高山上的试探（马太福音里的第三个试探）后耶稣要撒旦退去（马太福音4：10）。为了着重强调一个观点，福音书的作者经常会将不同的事件一起提出来，并没有给出事件发生的先后顺序。可能路加在这里所强调的是（事件发生的）地理位置，因为他最后以耶路撒冷作结。
Tempted by the devil – The testing of Jesus was to show what was in His heart and that He would keep God’s commands. A temptation is to entice one to do what is wrong.
受魔鬼的试探 --- 对耶稣的试探/测试是要将祂心里的所想显明出来，那就是祂是要遵守神的旨意。而试探是要引诱人犯罪。

If you are the Son of God – The devil is not casting doubt on Jesus divine son ship, but is tempting Him to use his supernatural powers as the Son of God for His own ends.
你若是神的儿子 --- 魔鬼并没有怀疑耶稣作为神儿子的神圣名分，而是要引诱祂利用祂作为神儿子所具有的超能力来为自己所用。
Stone to become bread – Jesus had fasted for forty days and Jesus’ hunger was great. The devil wanted to make his temptation seem attractive.
石头变成食物 --- 耶稣已经禁食四十天，祂已经非常饿了。魔鬼想让他的试探更具吸引力。
Worship me – The temptation was tempting Jesus to avoid the sufferings of the cross and offered an easy shortcut to world dominion.
在我面前下拜 --- 这个试探是要引诱耶稣躲避十架上的苦难，给耶稣提供一个统治世界的捷径。
Highest point of the temple – Either the southeast corner of the temple colonnade, from which there was a drop of some 100 feet to the Kidron Valley fellow, or the pinnacle of the temple proper which had a depth of 600 feet.
在殿顶上 ---或是圣殿柱廊的东南角（此处距汲沦溪谷高约100英尺），或是圣殿的顶端（高约600英尺）。

Jesus Rejected at Nazareth The events in verses 14-15 probably occur one year after Jesus' temptation in the wilderness. It is quite likely that Jesus spent that first year, after the temptations, ministering in Judea. John's Gospel talks about His ministry during that time.
耶稣在拿撒勒被厌弃第14到15节里所记录的事件可能发生在耶稣在旷野受试探后的一年。很可能耶稣在受试探后的第一年里在犹大地事工。约翰福音讲到了这段时间里耶稣的事工。
 14Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. 15He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
4:14耶稣满有圣灵的能力回到加利利，他的名声就传遍了四方。4:15他在各会堂里教训人，众人都称赞他。
 16He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. Find Nazareth on the map from lesson 1. What lessons can we learn from Jesus' custom of being in the synagogue on the Sabbath? And he stood up to read. 17The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:
 18"The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
      because he has anointed me
      to preach good news to the poor.
   He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners
      and recovery of sight for the blind,
   to release the oppressed,
4:16耶稣来到拿撒勒，就是他长大的地方。在安息日，照他平常的规矩，进了会堂，请在第一课的地图里找到拿撒勒。从耶稣在安息日进会堂的规矩中我们可以学到什么？站起来要念圣经。4:17有人把先知以赛亚的书交给他，他就打开，找到一处写着说，4:18主的灵在我身上，因为他用膏膏我，叫我传福音给贫穷的人。差遣我报告被掳的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，叫那受压制的得自由，
    19to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." What is "the year of the Lord's favor?" 20Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him, 21and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing." What startling announcement does Jesus make about this prophecy?
4:19报告神悦纳人的禧年。什么是“神悦纳人的禧年”？4:20于是把书卷起来，交还执事，就坐下。会堂里的人都定睛看他。4:21耶稣对他们说，今天这经应验在你们耳中了。关于这个预言耶稣作出了什么令人震惊的宣告？
22All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked. How did the people describe Jesus?
 23Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.' " (Jesus read the peoples thoughts and intentions; He anticipated their attack. They were not satisfied with preaching, but wanted evidence of His ability. They had heard that Jesus had done great miracles at Capernaum and elsewhere, and they believed that miracle should begin at home.)
4:22众人都称赞他，并希奇他口中所出的恩言。又说，这不是约瑟的儿子吗？人们如何来评价耶稣？4:23耶稣对他们说，你们必引这俗语向我说，医生，你医治自己吧。我们听见你在迦百农所行的事，也当行在你自己家乡里。（耶稣能看到人们的想法和意图；祂预料到他们的攻击。他们对耶稣的讲道不满意，而是想要能证明耶稣能力的证据。他们听到耶稣在迦百农和别的地方行过大神迹，他们认为行神迹应该从家乡开始。）
 24"I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 25I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. 26Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. 27And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian." How does Jesus try to correct the notion many Jews had, that God's love included only Jews and that God favored them? 28All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. 29They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff. How did the people at the synagogue react to Jesus at the end of His address? 30But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way. How did Jesus escape?
4:24又说，我实在告诉你们，没有先知在自己家乡被人悦纳的。4:25我对你们说实话，当以利亚的时候，天闭塞了三年零六个月，遍地有大饥荒，那时，以色列中有许多寡妇。4:26以利亚并没有奉差往他们一个人那里去，只奉差往西顿的撒勒法，一个寡妇那里去。4:27先知以利沙的时候，以色列中有许多长大麻疯的。但内中除了叙利亚国的乃缦，没有一个得洁净的。耶稣如何来纠正许多犹太人的观念，神的爱只是对犹太人的而且神偏爱他们？4:28会堂里的人听见这话，都怒气满胸。4:29就起来撵他出城，他们的城造在山上，他们带他到山崖，要把他推下去。在耶稣的讲话结束时会堂里的人是如何回应他的？4:30他却从他们中间直行，过去了。耶稣如何离开的？

Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit 耶稣赶出污鬼
 31Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people. Find Capernaum on the map. 32They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority. What does it mean to be "amazed"?
4:31耶稣下到迦百农，就是加利利的一座城，在安息日教训众人。在地图上找到迦百农。4:32他们很希奇他的教训，因为他的话里有权柄。“希奇”指的是什么意思？
 33In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evilspirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 34"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!" What does the evil spirit acknowledge? What does the evil spirit fear?
 35"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. How does Jesus show love? authority and power?
 36All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!" 37And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
4:33在会堂里有一个人，被污鬼的精气附着，大声喊叫说，4:34唉，拿撒勒的耶稣，我们与你有什么相干，你来灭我们吗？我知道你是谁，乃是神的圣者。污鬼在承认什么？污鬼害怕什么？4:35耶稣责备他说，不要作声，从这人身上出来吧。鬼把那人摔倒在众人中间，就出来了，却也没有害他。耶稣如何表现出爱？权柄和能力？
4:36众人都惊讶，彼此对问说，这是什么道理呢？因为他用权柄能力吩咐污鬼，污鬼就出来。4:37于是耶稣的名声传遍了周围地方。

Jesus Heals Many耶稣治好许多人
 38Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 39So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. How did Jesus show love to Simon's mother-in law? How did she show love?  40When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. Why do you think people were waiting for the sun to set? How many people did Jesus heal? 41Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. What do we learn about the evil angels and their relationship to Jesus?
4:38耶稣出了会堂，进了西门的家。西门的岳母害热病甚重。有人为她求耶稣。4:39耶稣站在她旁边，斥责那热病，热就退了。她立刻起来服事他们。耶稣如何来爱西门的岳母的？她是如何用行动来表现出她的爱的？4:40日落的时候，凡有病人的，不论害什么病，都带到耶稣那里。耶稣按手在他们各人身上，医好他们。你认为人们为什么要等到日落？耶稣治愈了多少人？4:41又有鬼从好些人身上出来，喊着说，你是神的儿子。耶稣斥责他们，不许他们说话，因为他们知道他是基督。关于污鬼和他们与耶稣的关系，我们都学到了什么？
 42At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. 43But he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent." 44And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. What important things is Jesus concerned about and committed to?
4:42天亮的时候，耶稣出来，走到旷野地方。众人去找他，到了他那里，要留住他，不要他离开他们。4:43但耶稣对他们说，我也必须在别城传神国的福音。因我奉差原是为此。4:44于是耶稣在加利利的各会堂传道。耶稣关心并委身到什么重要的事情？

Notes注释
Scroll of the prophet Isaiah - The books of the Old Testament were written on scrolls, kept in a special place in the synagogue and handed to the reader by a special attendant. The passage Jesus read about the Messiah (Isaiah 61:1-2) may have been one he chose to read, or it may have been the assigned passage for the day.
先知以赛亚的书 --- 旧约是写在书卷上的，被存放在会堂里的一个特别的地方，并由一个特别的侍者交予诵读的人。耶稣读到的关于弥赛亚的经文（以赛亚书61：1-2）可能是祂自己选的，或是那一天指定要读的经文。
Capernaum - Jesus made the city of Capernaum His headquarters during His Galilean ministry.
迦百农---耶稣将迦百农作为他加利利事工的总部。
Possessed by a demon - This is an evil spirit and was able to cause mental disorder, violent action, bodily disease, and rebellion against God.
被污鬼的精气附着 --- 这是邪灵，能导致精神失常，暴力行为，身体上的疾病，以及对神的抗拒。
Simon - one of Jesus disciples. His name was later changed to Peter, which means "rock". He was a fisherman by trade and resided at Capernaum with his wife and mother-in-law.
西门 --- 耶稣的一个门徒。他的名字后被改为彼得，有“磐石”的意思。他是一个渔夫，同他的妻子和岳母一起住在迦百农。
