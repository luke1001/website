Exodus 5:1-23
出埃及记5:1-23
            Moses and Aaron were readily received by their people as God's messengers. But they could not leave Egypt to offer sacrifices without the permission of Pharaoh.  Pharaoh, however was openly defiant when he heard God's command to let Israel go into the wilderness and makes the Israelites burdens heavier.
摩西和亚伦被他们的弟兄欣然接纳为神的使者。但是他们若不得到法老的允许还不能离开埃及地去献祭。然而，当法老听到神的命令要以色列人离开去旷野里，公开的无视神的命令还要加重以色列人的负担。
kecheng: Bricks Without Straw
    1 Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’” At their audience with Pharaoh, did Moses and Aaron make a request or a demand? Explain your answer. Why would Moses want to go into the wilderness? See Exodus 8:26-27.
   2 Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go.” What does Pharaoh mean when he says "I do not know the Lord"?
   3 Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” What outcome would happen if Pharaoh does not let them go?
   4 But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!” What did Pharaoh think was behind the request to go to worship? 5 Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”
   6 That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: 7 “You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. What action did Pharaoh take against Israel that same day? 8 But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ What reason did Pharaoh give for his order? 9 Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.” What lies?
   10 Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw. 11 Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’” 12 So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 13 The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.” 14 And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?” What happened under this new policy?
   15 Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way? 16 Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” Who did the foremen say was at fault for the servants not being able to make their quota?
   17 Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ 18 Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.” What was Pharaoh's response?
   19 The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.”What kind of trouble?  20 When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, 21 and they said, “May the LORD look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” What message did the foremen give to Moses and Aaron?
Who did the foremen fear more - Pharaoh or God?
kecheng: 没有草来做砖
1后来摩西、亚伦去对法老说：「耶和华—以色列的　神这样说：『容我的百姓去，在旷野向我守节。』」摩西和亚伦在法老面前是在请求许可还是在提出要求？摩西为什么要求去旷野？参见出埃及记8:26-27
2法老说：「耶和华是谁，使我听他的话，容以色列人去呢？我不认识耶和华，也不容以色列人去！」当法老说“我不认识耶和华”时，他是指什么？
3他们说：「希伯来人的　神遇见了我们。求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，祭祀耶和华—我们的　神，免得他用瘟疫、刀兵攻击我们。」如果法老不允许他们去会发生什么事？
4埃及王对他们说：「摩西、亚伦！你们为什么叫百姓旷工呢？你们去担你们的担子吧！」法老认为在他们去敬拜的要求之中实际隐藏了什么目的？5又说：「看哪，这地的以色列人如今众多，你们竟叫他们歇下担子！」
6当天，法老吩咐督工的和官长说：7「你们不可照常把草给百姓做砖，叫他们自己去捡草。法老在当天采取了什么抵挡以色列人的行动？8他们素常做砖的数目，你们仍旧向他们要，一点不可减少；因为他们是懒惰的，所以呼求说：『容我们去祭祀我们的　神。』法老为他所下的命令给出什么理由？9你们要把更重的工夫加在这些人身上，叫他们劳碌，不听虚谎的言语。」虚慌的言语是什么？
10督工的和官长出来对百姓说：「法老这样说：『我不给你们草。11你们自己在哪里能找草，就往那里去找吧！但你们的工一点不可减少。』」12于是百姓散在埃及遍地，捡碎秸当作草。13督工的催着说：「你们一天当完一天的工，与先前有草一样。」14法老督工的，责打他所派以色列人的官长，说：「你们昨天今天为什么没有照向来的数目做砖、完你们的工作呢？」新政策导致了什么问题？
15以色列人的官长就来哀求法老说：「为什么这样待你的仆人？16督工的不把草给仆人，并且对我们说：『做砖吧！』看哪，你仆人挨了打，其实是你百姓的错。」官长说仆人不能完成工作的错误原因在乎谁？
17但法老说：「你们是懒惰的！你们是懒惰的！所以说：『容我们去祭祀耶和华。』18现在你们去做工吧！草是不给你们的，砖却要如数交纳。」法老是如何回应的？
19以色列人的官长听说「你们每天做砖的工作一点不可减少」，就知道是遭遇祸患了。是怎样的祸患？20他们离了法老出来，正遇见摩西、亚伦站在对面，21就向他们说：「愿耶和华鉴察你们，施行判断；因你们使我们在法老和他臣仆面前有了臭名，把刀递在他们手中杀我们。」官长是怎样对摩西和亚伦说的？这些官长惧怕谁？法老还是神？
Notes注释
Hold a festival - Egyptians had festival days when workers could make sacrifices. It seems Moses' request, as the Israelites' representative, was not unusual.
守节 - 埃及人过节的时候，工人可以去献祭。似乎摩西代表以色列人的要求并不是不寻常的要求。
kecheng: Slave drivers and overseers - Israelite supervisors appointed by the Egyptian taskmasters.
督工的和官长 - 这些是由埃及督工所指定的以色列人管理者。
kecheng: Straw - Bricks were made by mixing clay straw and water. The chopped straw  kept the mud mixture from cracking. The mud was put into molds to form the bricks and were dried in the sun. Now that the straw was no longer furnished to the Israelites, they had to gather the long stubbles of the grain fields after the grain had been cut by the Egyptians a little below the grain head.
草 - 砖是由粘土、稻草和水混合制成的。切碎的草避免泥巴混合物分解。泥巴放入模具中来做成砖形并在太阳底下干燥。现在草不再提供给以色列人，他们不得不在田地里收集草径，埃及人收割谷物之后在田地里留下的草径。
kecheng: God Promises Deliverance
22 Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? 23 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.” Who did Moses ultimately blame for the troubles? Explain.
神应许拯救
22 摩西回到耶和华那里，说：「主啊，你为什么苦待这百姓呢？为什么打发我去呢？23 自从我去见法老，奉你的名说话，他就苦待这百姓，你一点也没有拯救他们。」摩西最终把这困难怪罪于谁？请解释。
