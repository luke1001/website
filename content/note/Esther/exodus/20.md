Exodus 20:1-26
出埃及记20:1-26
            As Moses had led the people to the foot of the mountain, he went up the mountain with Aaron to receive God's commandments to Israel. While the law was given, he was therefore, not at the foot of the mountain. When he and Aaron returned to the bounds he had set round about the mountain the people had all fled in great freight at what they had seen and heard. And now the heads of the tribes and elders asked Moses to act as their mediator between the people and the holy God.
当摩西带领人们来到山脚下后，他和亚伦一同上山去接受神给以色列人的命令。当律法被颁布的时候，他不是在山脚下。当他和亚伦回到他在山脚所设的界限时，人们都因他们看到和听到的远远站立。接着，官长和长老请求摩西作为他们在人和圣洁的神之间的中介。
kecheng: The Ten Commandments
    1 And God spoke all these words:
   2 “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. Why is the preamble to the Commandments in vs. 1-2 important?
   3 “You shall have no other gods beforeme. What are some of the current gods that rival the true God for the allegiance of people's hearts?
   4 “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. What is God prohibiting?  5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, What does it mean to be a jealous God? What does it mean to punish the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation? 6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments. How extensive is God's love to those who are faithful?
   7 “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. What are ways people misuse God's name?
   8 “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. What was the purpose in establishing a Sabbath day? What do vs. 9-11 help us understand about the days of creation?
十诫
1神吩咐这一切的话说：2「我是耶和华—你的　神，曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来。为什么在1-2节中十诫的序言是非常重要的？
 3 「除了我以外，你不可有别的神。现今有哪些别神要争取人心里对真神的忠心？4「不可为自己雕刻偶像，也不可做什么形象仿佛上天、下地，和地底下、水中的百物。神禁止什么？5不可跪拜那些像，也不可事奉它，因为我耶和华—你的　神是忌邪的　神。恨我的，我必追讨他的罪，自父及子，直到三四代；忌邪的神是什么意思？追讨他的罪自父及子直到三四代是什么意思？6爱我、守我诫命的，我必向他们发慈爱，直到千代。神对那些忠信的人的爱有多么广阔？
7「不可妄称耶和华—你　神的名；因为妄称耶和华名的，耶和华必不以他为无罪。人会用哪些方式来妄称神的名？
8「当记念安息日，守为圣日。9六日要劳碌做你一切的工，10但第七日是向耶和华—你　神当守的安息日。这一日你和你的儿女、仆婢、牲畜，并你城里寄居的客旅，无论何工都不可做；11因为六日之内，耶和华造天、地、海，和其中的万物，第七日便安息，所以耶和华赐福与安息日，定为圣日。  设立安息日的目的是什么？9-11节怎样帮助我们明白创造的日子？
12 “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
   13 “You shall not murder.
   14 “You shall not commit adultery.
   15 “You shall not steal.
   16 “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
What kind of respect for others does God call for in the following verses?
            Vs.12
            vs. 13
            vs.14
            vs.15
            vs. 16
   17 “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” What is the sin of coveting? Why is this sin stressed?
12「当孝敬父母，使你的日子在耶和华—你　神所赐你的地上得以长久。
13「不可杀人。
14「不可奸淫。
15「不可偷盗。
16「不可作假见证陷害人。
在以下几节中神要求我们对其他人又怎样的尊重？
            12节
            13节
14节
15节
16节
17「不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。」什么是贪恋的罪？为什么要强调这项罪？
   18 When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance 19 and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.” How did the Israelites react to God's revelation at Mt. Sinai?
   20 Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning.” What kind of test is God giving the Israelites?
   21 The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
18众百姓见雷轰、闪电、角声、山上冒烟，就都发颤，远远地站立，19对摩西说：「求你和我们说话，我们必听；不要　神和我们说话，恐怕我们死亡。」以色列人如何回应神在西奈山上的显现的？
20摩西对百姓说：「不要惧怕；因为　神降临是要试验你们，叫你们时常敬畏他，不致犯罪。」神给以色列人怎样的试验？
21于是百姓远远地站立；摩西就挨近　神所在的幽暗之中。
kecheng: Idols and Altars
    22 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites this: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: 23 Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold. What message did God repeat?
   24 “‘Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you. When will God bless His people? 25 If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it. What could an altar of stone be mistaken for? 26 And do not go up to my altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.’ Exposure of the sexual organs was disrespectful. Priests were required to wear linen undergarments.
偶像和祭坛
22耶和华对摩西说：「你要向以色列人这样说：『你们自己看见我从天上和你们说话了。23你们不可做什么神像与我相配，不可为自己做金银的神像。神重复了什么信息？
24你要为我筑土坛，在上面以牛羊献为燔祭和平安祭。凡记下我名的地方，我必到那里赐福给你。神什么时候会祝福祂的子民？25你若为我筑一座石坛，不可用凿成的石头，因你在上头一动家具，就把坛污秽了。石坛可能会因为什么而破坏？26你上我的坛，不可用台阶，免得露出你的下体来。』」暴露性器官是失礼的。祭祀需要穿细麻布的内衣。
kecheng: Notes注释
The Ten Commandments - The phrase in the original is "the ten words". Other phrases for "the ten words" are "the words of the covenant". The Ten Commandments were written by the finger of God on two stone tablets. The two tablets message is: Love God above all things and love thy neighbor as thyself.
十诫– 该词在原文中的意思是“十句话”，其它指代“十句话”的短语有“约上的话语”。十诫是神的手指写在两块石板上的。这两块石板的信息是：爱神超越一切并且爱人如己。
