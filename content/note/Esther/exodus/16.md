Exodus 16:1-36
出埃及记16:1-36
God meets Israel's need for food with bread from heaven. However, when the Israelites ignore God's simple rules for its collection and consumption, they provoke an exasperated rebuke from God. Israel does not understand at the time, but God is blessing them through this experience, teaching them to work and to set aside time to honor God.
神从天上降下粮来，满足了以色列人对食物的需要。但是当以色列人不顾神给他们的采集食物的准则，他们招致了从神而来的惩戒。以色列人一时不明白，但是神藉着他们的经历来祝福他们，教导他们去工作并预留时间来荣耀神。
kecheng: Manna and Quail
1 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt. 2 In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. Who are they really complaining against? 3 The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.” What complaint did the Israelites bring to Moses and Aaron? What had the Israelites forgotten? Why is it that when some people are faced with adversity, large or small, their first tendency is to complain?
4 Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. What miraculous plan of providing did God reveal to Moses? In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions. How would God's provision develop and test the spiritual life of the Israelites? 5 On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.” Why are they to gather twice as much food on the sixth day?
吗哪和鹌鹑
1以色列全会众从以琳起行，在出埃及后第二个月十五日到了以琳和西奈中间、汛的旷野。2以色列全会众在旷野向摩西、亚伦发怨言，他们实际上是在向谁发怨言？3说：「巴不得我们早死在埃及地、耶和华的手下；那时我们坐在肉锅旁边，吃得饱足。你们将我们领出来，到这旷野，是要叫这全会众都饿死啊！」 以色列人向摩西和亚伦抱怨什么？以色列人忘记了什么？为什么当人遇到逆境时，无论大小，他们的第一发应是抱怨？
4耶和华对摩西说：「我要将粮食从天降给你们。百姓可以出去，每天收每天的分，神向摩西显明了怎样的一个供应他们的神迹计划？我好试验他们遵不遵我的法度。神的供应是如何开展的并且会如何实验以色列人的属灵生命？5到第六天，他们要把所收进来的预备好了，比每天所收的多一倍。」为什么要他们在第六天时要多收一倍的食物？
6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt, 7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. What does the Lord hear? Who are we, that you should grumble against us?” To what did Moses and Aaron object? 8 Moses also said, “You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD.” What specifically was the Lord going to provide?
9 Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.’”
10 While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud. How did the Lord appear to the Israelite community?
6摩西、亚伦对以色列众人说：「到了晚上，你们要知道是耶和华将你们从埃及地领出来的。7早晨，你们要看见耶和华的荣耀，因为耶和华听见你们向他所发的怨言了。神听见了什么？我们算什么，你们竟向我们发怨言呢？」摩西和亚伦反对什么事？8摩西又说：「耶和华晚上必给你们肉吃，早晨必给你们食物得饱；因为你们向耶和华发的怨言，他都听见了。我们算什么，你们的怨言不是向我们发的，乃是向耶和华发的。」神将要特别供应什么？
9摩西对亚伦说：「你告诉以色列全会众说：『你们就近耶和华面前，因为他已经听见你们的怨言了。』」10亚伦正对以色列全会众说话的时候，他们向旷野观看，不料，耶和华的荣光在云中显现。神怎样在以色列全会众中显现的？
kecheng: 11 The LORD said to Moses, 12 “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.’” What did the Lord want the Israelites to know?
13 That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When does the quail appear? 14 When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. 15 When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. What type of food did the Lord provide?
Moses said to them, “It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat. 16 This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omerfor each person you have in your tent.’” How much food was to be gathered?
11耶和华晓谕摩西说：12「我已经听见以色列人的怨言。你告诉他们说：『到黄昏的时候，你们要吃肉，早晨必有食物得饱，你们就知道我是耶和华—你们的　神。』」神想要以色列人明白什么？
13到了晚上，有鹌鹑飞来，遮满了营；早晨在营四围的地上有露水。鹌鹑什么时候出现？14露水上升之后，不料，野地面上有如白霜的小圆物。15以色列人看见，不知道是什么，就彼此对问说：「这是什么呢？」神供应的是什么样食物？
摩西对他们说：「这就是耶和华给你们吃的食物。16耶和华所吩咐的是这样：你们要按着各人的饭量，为帐棚里的人，按着人数收起来，各拿一俄梅珥。」他们要收取多少食物？
17 The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little. 18 And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed. How much did each person have?
19 Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.” Why was "No one to keep any of it until morning"?
20 However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. Why do you think some Israelites did not follow Moses instructions?
21 Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. 22 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omersfor each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses. 23 He said to them, “This is what the LORD commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD. What did the Lord expect on the seventh day? So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’” Why was it OK to keep some overnight on the sixth day?   24 So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. 25 “Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today. 26 Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.” What would not be found on the seventh day? In summary, what three lessons did God want to teach Israel through the bread?
17以色列人就这样行；有多收的，有少收的。18及至用俄梅珥量一量，多收的也没有余，少收的也没有缺；各人按着自己的饭量收取。每个人收取了多少食物？19摩西对他们说：「所收的，不许什么人留到早晨。」为什么“不许什么人留到早晨”？20然而他们不听摩西的话，内中有留到早晨的，就生虫变臭了；摩西便向他们发怒。你认为这些以色列人为什么不听摩西的话？21他们每日早晨，按着各人的饭量收取，日头一发热，就消化了。22到第六天，他们收了双倍的食物，每人两俄梅珥。会众的官长来告诉摩西；23摩西对他们说：「耶和华这样说：『明天是圣安息日，是向耶和华守的圣安息日。神对第七天又怎样的期许？你们要烤的就烤了，要煮的就煮了，所剩下的都留到早晨。』」为什么在第六天可以保留食物过夜？24他们就照摩西的吩咐留到早晨，也不臭，里头也没有虫子。25摩西说：「你们今天吃这个吧！因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日；你们在田野必找不着了。26六天可以收取，第七天乃是安息日，那一天必没有了。」在第七天找不着什么？总结上述内容，神想要藉着食物教导以色列人哪三样功课？   
27 Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. What did this reveal to God? 28 Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will yourefuse to keep my commands and my instructions? Who do you think is meant by the word "you"? 29 Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day; no one is to go out.” 30 So the people rested on the seventh day. Why did the Lord want the people to rest on the seventh day? When had the seventh day been set aside as a day of rest? (hint, see Gen.2:2-3)
   31 The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey. How does the manna taste?
32 Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’” Why was Moses to save some of the manna?
   33 So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come.”
   34 As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved. (The manna and the Ten Commandments  were later placed in the ark of the covenant, see Ex. 25:10) 35 The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan. For how long did God provide manna? When did He stop? Why do people complain about the blessings God provides for them?
   36 (An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
27第七天，百姓中有人出去收，什么也找不着。这向神表明了什么？28耶和华对摩西说：「你们不肯守我的诫命和律法，要到几时呢？这里的“你们”指的是谁？29你们看！耶和华既将安息日赐给你们，所以第六天他赐给你们两天的食物，第七天各人要住在自己的地方，不许什么人出去。」神为什么要人在第七天休息？什么时候确立了第七天分别为休息的日子？（提示，参考创世纪2:2-3）
30于是百姓第七天安息了。31这食物，以色列家叫吗哪；样子像芫荽子，颜色是白的，滋味如同搀蜜的薄饼。吗哪的味道怎么样？32摩西说：「耶和华所吩咐的是这样：『要将一满俄梅珥吗哪留到世世代代，使后人可以看见我当日将你们领出埃及地，在旷野所给你们吃的食物。』」摩西为什么要存一些吗哪？33摩西对亚伦说：「你拿一个罐子，盛一满俄梅珥吗哪，存在耶和华面前，要留到世世代代。」34耶和华怎么吩咐摩西，亚伦就怎么行，把吗哪放在法柜前存留。（吗哪和十诫的石板后来被放进约柜中，参考出埃及记25:10）35以色列人吃吗哪共四十年，直到进了有人居住之地，就是迦南的境界。36俄梅珥就是伊法十分之一。神供应了多长时间的吗哪？什么时候停止了这样的供应。人们为什么会抱怨神供应给他们的祝福？
