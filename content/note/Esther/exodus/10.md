Exodus 10:1-29
出埃及记10:1-29
            Pharaoh seeks compromise and even forgiveness, but his pride still refuses to bend to the will of God. God strengthened Moses' faith by saying that the hardening of Pharaoh was according to His divine will so that the signs would confirm to Israel and all successive generations that the Lord is God. Pharaoh's confession was only a pious expression.
            法老想要妥协还有赦免。但是他的骄傲仍然使他拒绝顺服神的旨意。藉着说明使法老硬着心是出于神的旨意，神坚立了摩西的信心，从而使以色列人和他们的后裔确信祂是至高神。法老的忏悔仅仅使出于伪善。
kecheng: The Plague of Locusts
    1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them 2 that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD.” Why did the Lord harden Pharaoh's heart?
   3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me. What did the Lord expect from Pharaoh? Explain. 4 If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow. 5 They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields. 6 They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your parents nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. Describe the eighth plague.
   7 Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?” How did Pharaoh's counsel react?
   8 Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But tell me who will be going.” What message did Pharaoh give to Moses and Aaron?
   9 Moses answered, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD.”
   10 Pharaoh said, “The LORD be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil. Is this a blessing or a threat? Why? 11 No! Have only the men go and worship the LORD, since that’s what you have been asking for.” Why not allow the women and children to go? Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh’s presence. Think of an example of how people find fault with a command of God in order to justify their disobedience.
   12 And the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.”
   13 So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts; 14 they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again. 15 They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt. Locusts had swarmed over Egypt before. How was this different?
   16 Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. 17 Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me.”What makes a confession of sins like Pharaoh's so spiritually dangerous?
   18 Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD. 19 And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt. What is noteworthy about God's removal of this plague? 20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
蝗灾
1 耶和华对摩西说：「你进去见法老。我使他和他臣仆的心刚硬，为要在他们中间显我这些神迹，2 并要叫你将我向埃及人所做的事，和在他们中间所行的神迹，传于你儿子和你孙子的耳中，好叫你们知道我是耶和华。」神为什么要使法老的心刚硬？
3 摩西、亚伦就进去见法老，对他说：「耶和华—希伯来人的　神这样说：『你在我面前不肯自卑要到几时呢？容我的百姓去，好事奉我。神期望法老怎样做？请解释。4 你若不肯容我的百姓去，明天我要使蝗虫进入你的境内，5 遮满地面，甚至看不见地，并且吃那冰雹所剩的和田间所长的一切树木。6 你的宫殿和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要被蝗虫占满了；自从你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗在世以来，直到今日，没有见过这样的灾。』」摩西就转身离开法老出去。请描述第八灾。
7 法老的臣仆对法老说：「这人为我们的网罗要到几时呢？容这些人去事奉耶和华—他们的　神吧！埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗？」法老的臣仆有什么反应？
8 于是摩西、亚伦被召回来见法老；法老对他们说：「你们去事奉耶和华—你们的　神；但那要去的是谁呢？」法老给摩西和亚伦怎样的信息？
9 摩西说：「我们要和我们老的少的、儿子女儿同去，且把羊群牛群一同带去，因为我们务要向耶和华守节。」
10 法老对他们说：「我容你们和你们妇人孩子去的时候，耶和华与你们同在吧！你们要谨慎；因为有祸在你们眼前，这是祝福还是威胁？为什么？
11 不可都去！你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧，因为这是你们所求的。」为什么不允许妇女和孩子一起去？于是把他们从法老面前撵出去。请举一个例子说明人们是如何从神的命令中找茬从而为自己的悖逆辩护的？
12 耶和华对摩西说：「你向埃及地伸杖，使蝗虫到埃及地上来，吃地上一切的菜蔬，就是冰雹所剩的。」
13 摩西就向埃及地伸杖，那一昼一夜，耶和华使东风刮在埃及地上；到了早晨，东风把蝗虫刮了来。14 蝗虫上来，落在埃及的四境，甚是厉害；以前没有这样的，以后也必没有。15 因为这蝗虫遮满地面，甚至地都黑暗了，又吃地上一切的菜蔬和冰雹所剩树上的果子。埃及遍地，无论是树木，是田间的菜蔬，连一点青的也没有留下。蝗虫曾经在埃及地出现过，这一次有什么不同？
16 于是法老急忙召了摩西、亚伦来，说：「我得罪耶和华—你们的　神，又得罪了你们。17 现在求你，只这一次，饶恕我的罪，求耶和华—你们的　神使我脱离这一次的死亡。」是什么使得法老的认罪在属灵方面如此危险？
18 摩西就离开法老去求耶和华。19 耶和华转了极大的西风，把蝗虫刮起，吹入红海；在埃及的四境连一个也没有留下。神除掉这一灾的过程中，有什么特别的地方？20 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人去。
kecheng: Notes
Locusts - Normally the locusts came with a wind from the South. This time the Lord caused an east wind to bring the locusts perhaps from faraway Arabia.
kecheng: 蝗虫 - 通常蝗虫伴随的南风而来。这一次神藉着东风带来蝗虫，它们可能来自遥远的阿拉伯半岛。
kecheng: The Plague of Darkness
    21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.”What could possibly cause a darkness that could be felt?  22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. 23 No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived. Describe the ninth plague. Who were the Egyptians not able to worship?
   24 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind.” What is Pharaoh's compromise? Why did he want the flocks left behind? What does a person communicate when he/she sets conditions on his/her obedience?
   25 But Moses said, “You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God. 26 Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD.” Why did Moses say they must bring all the livestock?
   27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go. 28 Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.” What threat is made?
   29 “Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.” What do you think Moses knows is going to happen next?
黑暗之灾   
21 耶和华对摩西说：「你向天伸杖，使埃及地黑暗；这黑暗似乎摸得着。」什么可能造成可以摸得着的黑暗？22 摩西向天伸杖，埃及遍地就乌黑了三天。23 三天之久，人不能相见，谁也不敢起来离开本处；惟有以色列人家中都有亮光。请描述第九灾，埃及人再不能敬拜谁了？
24 法老就召摩西来，说：「你们去事奉耶和华；只是你们的羊群牛群要留下；你们的妇人孩子可以和你们同去。」法老做出了什么妥协？他为什么想要把牛羊留下？当人给他/她的顺服加上条件，他/她实际上表达了什么意思？
25 摩西说：「你总要把祭物和燔祭牲交给我们，使我们可以祭祀耶和华—我们的　神。26 我们的牲畜也要带去，连一蹄也不留下；因为我们要从其中取出来，事奉耶和华—我们的　神。我们未到那里，还不知道用什么事奉耶和华。」摩西为什么说他们必须要带走所有的牲畜？
27 但耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不肯容他们去。28 法老对摩西说：「你离开我去吧，你要小心，不要再见我的面！因为你见我面的那日你就必死！」法老做出了什么威胁？
29 摩西说：「你说得好！我必不再见你的面了。」你认为摩西对将要发生的事知道些什么？
