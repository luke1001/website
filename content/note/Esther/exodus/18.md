Exodus 18:1-27
出埃及记18:1-27
            Moses serves as the chief mediator between God and the Israelites, and God uses Moses and his subordinates to teach the people about Himself through His Law. God also uses Moses to provide access to Him since the people come to Moses to seek God's will.
摩西作为神和以色列人之间的主要中介，并且神使用摩西和他的随从藉着祂的律法来教导人认识祂。神还藉着摩西使人能够接近祂，因为人们可以来到摩西面前寻求神的旨意。
kecheng: Jethro Visits Moses
    1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. What do you know about Jethro (who he was, where he lived, and how Moses met him)?
   2 After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her 3 and her two sons. When might Moses sent his wife and sons back to his father-in-laws. (The last time we heard of Ziporah was in Ex. 4:24-26.) One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land”; 4 and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, “My father’s God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.” Why might Moses have chosen these names?
   5 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, together with Moses’ sons and wife, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God. What is the name of the mountain of God? see Ex.3:1 6 Jethro had sent word to him, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”What reason did Jethro have to visit Moses?
叶忒罗访问摩西
1摩西的岳父，米甸祭司叶忒罗，听见　神为摩西和　神的百姓以色列所行的一切事，就是耶和华将以色列从埃及领出来的事，你对叶忒罗有怎样的了解？（他是谁？他住在哪里？摩西是怎样遇见他的？）
2便带着摩西的妻子西坡拉，就是摩西从前打发回去的，3又带着西坡拉的两个儿子，摩西可能在什么时候打发他的妻子和儿子们回到他岳父那里去？（我们之前读到西坡拉是在出埃及记4:24-26）一个名叫革舜，因为摩西说：「我在外邦作了寄居的」；4一个名叫以利以谢，因为他说：「我父亲的　神帮助了我，救我脱离法老的刀。」摩西选择这些名字的可能的原因是什么？
5摩西的岳父叶忒罗带着摩西的妻子和两个儿子来到　神的山，就是摩西在旷野安营的地方。神的山叫什么名字？参看出埃及记3:16他对摩西说：「我是你岳父叶忒罗，带着你的妻子和两个儿子来到你这里。」叶忒罗访问摩西的原因是什么？
7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent. 8 Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them. Describe how Moses greeted his father-in-law.
   9 Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. 10 He said, “Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. 11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.” 12 Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God. Name at least 4 ways in which Jethro responded to the news of God's deliverance of Israel in verses 9-12.
What are some ways you respond to the blessings from God.
7摩西迎接他的岳父，向他下拜，与他亲嘴，彼此问安，都进了帐棚。8摩西将耶和华为以色列的缘故向法老和埃及人所行的一切事，以及路上所遭遇的一切艰难，并耶和华怎样搭救他们，都述说与他岳父听。请描述摩西是如何接待他的岳父的？
9叶忒罗因耶和华待以色列的一切好处，就是拯救他们脱离埃及人的手，便甚欢喜。10叶忒罗说：「耶和华是应当称颂的；他救了你们脱离埃及人和法老的手，将这百姓从埃及人的手下救出来。11我现今在埃及人向这百姓发狂傲的事上得知，耶和华比万神都大。」12摩西的岳父叶忒罗把燔祭和平安祭献给　神。亚伦和以色列的众长老都来了，与摩西的岳父在　神面前吃饭。   请举出至少四例在9-12节中叶忒罗对神拯救以色列人的信息的回应？你会用怎样的方式来回应神对你的祝福？
13 The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening. What was Moses serving as? For how many people? 14 When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?” What did Jethro observe?
   15 Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will. 16 Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and instructions.” What reason did Jethro give to Moses?
   17 Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good. 18 You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. What concerns did Jethro express?  19 Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him. 20 Teach them his decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave. In what capacity should Moses continue? 21 But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.22 Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. What would be the role of the officials? That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. 23 If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.” How will Moses benefit?
13第二天，摩西坐着审判百姓，百姓从早到晚都站在摩西的左右。摩西在担任什么职责？他在为多少人服务？14摩西的岳父看见他向百姓所做的一切事，就说：「你向百姓做的是什么事呢？你为什么独自坐着，众百姓从早到晚都站在你的左右呢？」叶忒罗观察到什么？
15摩西对岳父说：「这是因百姓到我这里来求问　神。16他们有事的时候就到我这里来，我便在两造之间施行审判；我又叫他们知道　神的律例和法度。」叶忒罗对摩西说的理由是什么？
17摩西的岳父说：「你这做的不好。18你和这些百姓必都疲惫；因为这事太重，你独自一人办理不了。叶忒罗表达了怎样的忧虑？19现在你要听我的话。我为你出个主意，愿　神与你同在。你要替百姓到　神面前，将案件奏告　神；20又要将律例和法度教训他们，指示他们当行的道，当做的事；摩西应当继续承担什么能力？21并要从百姓中拣选有才能的人，就是敬畏　神、诚实无妄、恨不义之财的人，派他们作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长，管理百姓，22叫他们随时审判百姓，大事都要呈到你这里，小事他们自己可以审判。官长的职责是什么？这样，你就轻省些，他们也可以同当此任。23你若这样行，　神也这样吩咐你，你就能受得住，这百姓也都平平安安归回他们的住处。」   摩西将会怎样受益？
24 Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 25 He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. 26 They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves. How did Moses respond to Jethro's advice?
   27 Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country. What is Jethro's country? see Ex.2:15. Why is the gift of administration so valuable.
24于是，摩西听从他岳父的话，按着他所说的去行。25摩西从以色列人中拣选了有才能的人，立他们为百姓的首领，作千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长。26他们随时审判百姓，有难断的案件就呈到摩西那里，但各样小事他们自己审判。摩西是如何回应叶忒罗的建议的？
27此后，摩西让他的岳父去，他就往本地去了。叶忒罗的本国在哪里？参看出埃及记2:15。为什么管理的恩赐非常重要？
