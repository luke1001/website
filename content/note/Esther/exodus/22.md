VII.      The Ninth And Tenth Commandments第九条和第十条诫命

            Exodus 20:17 – You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. (Ninth             Commandment)
            You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox        or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor. (Tenth Commandment)

In the Ninth and Tenth Commandments, God teaches us to have hearts that      are holy and satisfied with what God gives.

      God condemns the sin of coveting.  Coveting is the sinful desire or craving          for things and experiences we should not want to have, especially when they    belong to others.
出埃及记20：17 - 不可贪恋人的房屋（第九条诫命），也不可贪恋人的妻子，仆婢，牛驴，并他一切所有的（第十条诫命）。

在第九条和第十条诫命中，神教导我们要存圣洁的心知足的心，满足神所赐给我们的一切。

            Proverbs 15:26b – The thoughts of the pure are pleasing to the Lord.

            In the Ninth and Tenth Commandments, God demands that we desire only        things that are pure and pleasing to Him.

箴言15：26b - 良言乃为纯净。

在第九条和第十条诫命中，神要我们只渴求纯净讨神喜悦的事物。
1 Chronicles 28:9b – Acknowledge the God of your father, and serve Him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts.

                        God wants us to remember that He searches all our thoughts and motives                                 and that He requires us to serve Him with fully devoted hearts.
历代志上28：9b -你当认识耶和华你父的神，诚心乐意地事奉他。因为他鉴察众人的心，知道一切心思意念。你若寻求他，他必使你寻见。你若离弃他，他必永远丢弃你。

神要我们记住祂鉴察我们所有的心思意念，祂要我们全心事奉他。

Psalm 37:4 – Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.

                        God requires that we find our supreme joy in having Him as our Savior and                     Lord.
诗篇37：4 - 又要以耶和华为乐。他就将你心里所求的赐给你。

我们有神为我们的救主，神要我们以此为乐。

1 Timothy 6:6-8 – But godliness with contentment is great gain.  For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it.  But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.
Philippians 4:12-13 – I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.  13 I can do everything through him who gives me strength.

                        God requires that we be content in every situation of life with what He so                          lovingly provides for us.
提摩太前书6：6-8 - 然而敬虔加上知足的心便是大利了。6:7因为我们没有带什么到世上来，也不能带什么去。6:8只要有衣有食，就当知足。

腓立比书4：12-13 - 我知道怎样处卑贱，也知道怎样处丰富，或饱足，或饥饿，或有余，或缺乏，随事随在，我都得了秘诀。4:13我靠着那加给我力量的，凡事都能作。

神要我们无论在什么境况下都对祂爱的供应知足。

            Ecclesiastes 5:10 – Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever
                        loves wealth is never satisfied with his income. This too is meaningless.

                        God forbids us to be dissatisfied with what He gives us.
传道书5：10 - 贪爱银子的，不因得银子知足。贪爱丰富的，也不因得利益知足。这也是虚空。

神禁止我们对祂赐给我们的不知足。
Colossians 3:5-6 – Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.

                        God forbids us to be greedy, having a sinful craving for wealth and power.

歌罗西书3：5-6 - 所以要治死你们在地上的肢体。就如淫乱，污秽，邪情，恶欲，和贪婪，贪婪就与拜偶像一样。3:6因这些事，神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。

神禁止我们贪恋财富和权力。

James 3:14-15 – But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.  Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.  

                        God forbids us to be envious of others, selfishly wanting what belongs to                                    another.

雅各书3：14-15 - 你们心里若怀着苦毒的嫉妒和分争，就不可自夸，也不可说谎话抵挡真道。3:15这样的智慧，不是从上头来的，乃是属地的，属情欲的，属鬼魔的。

神禁止我们嫉妒他人，自私贪恋他人的财物。

            James 4:1-2 – What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come               from your desires that battle within you?  You want something but don’t get it.               You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight.                   You do not have, because you do not ask God.

雅各书4：1-2 - 你们中间的争战斗殴，是从哪里来的呢？不是从你们百体中战斗之私欲来的吗？4:2你们贪恋，还是得不着。你们杀害嫉妒，又斗殴争战，也不能得。你们得不着，是因为你们不求。     

            1 Timothy 6:9-10 – People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap                 and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and                               destruction.  For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager       for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

      God solemnly warns us that coveting leads to bitter conflict and spiritual grief     and ruin.
提摩太前书6：9-10 - 但那些想要发财的人，就陷在迷惑，落在网罗，和许多无知有害的私欲里，叫人沉在败坏和灭亡中。6:10贪财是万恶之根。有人贪恋钱财，就被引诱离了真道，用许多愁苦把自己刺透了。

神严肃地警告我们贪婪会导致痛苦争斗以及灵魂的败坏和灭亡。

            1 Peter 1:14-15 – As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you                had when you lived in ignorance.  But just as he who called you is holy, so be              holy in all you do.

彼得前书1：14-15 -你们既作顺命的儿女，就不要效法从前蒙昧无知的时候，那放纵私欲的样子。1:15那召你们的既是圣洁，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。

            Ecclesiastes 5:19 – Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions,      and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work--this is                    a gift of God.
      May God lead us to renounce evil desires and give us hearts that are filled          with holy aims and are content with all that He provides.
传道书5：19 -神赐人赀财丰富，使他能以吃用，能取自己的分，在他劳碌中喜乐。这乃是神的恩赐。

愿神带领我们断绝邪恶欲望，让我们心里怀有圣洁的目标，对祂的供应感到知足。

Lesson Review:  Mark each statement either A (Agree) or D (Disagree)

----- 1.  The 9th and 10th Commandments remind us that contentment is an important thing missing in many lives.   

----- 2.  Coveting is a relatively harmless sin since it affects only the inner attitudes of a person’s heart.   

课程回顾：请标出你是否同意下面的说法 A（同意）或D（不同意）

第九条和第十条诫命提醒我们知足是许多人生命里缺失的重要东西。
因为贪婪只影响到一个人内心的态度，所以它相对来说是无害的罪。
