Exodus 2:1-25
出埃及记2:1-25
            Moses was born to parents from the tribe of Levi just after Pharaoh had given his order that every baby boy was to be killed. Moses older brother, Aaron, was probably born three years earlier.
就在法老王下命令杀死所有男婴之后，摩西生在一个属利未支派的家庭。摩西的哥哥亚伦，可能出生于三年前。
kecheng: The Birth of Moses
    1 Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman, 2 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. What does it mean to be a fine child? 3 But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basketfor him and coated it with tar and pitch. Why coat the basket with tar and pitch? Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. Do you think the mother was thinking that the child would die of exposure? Why? 4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him. Why was the sister there?
   5 Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. What did Pharaoh's daughter notice? 6 She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. What do we learn about Pharaoh's daughter? “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said. What did Pharaoh's daughter realize?
   7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” Who came to Pharaoh's daughter?
   8 “Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother. 9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him. What was done to save the baby? 10 When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. What does it mean to become her son? What type of education would the child receive? What are some of the other benefits? She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”
摩西的出生
1有一个利未家的人娶了一个利未女子为妻。2那女人怀孕，生一个儿子，见他俊美，就藏了他三个月，俊美指的是什么意思？3后来不能再藏，就取了一个蒲草箱，抹上石漆和石油，为什么要在箱子上抹石油（沥青）？将孩子放在里头，把箱子搁在河边的芦荻中。你认为这个孩子的母亲会认为这个孩子被发现后会被治死吗？为什么？4孩子的姊姊远远站着，要知道他究竟怎么样。他的姐姐为什么要在那里？
5法老的女儿来到河边洗澡，她的使女们在河边行走。她看见箱子在芦荻中，就打发一个婢女拿来。法老的女儿发现了什么？6她打开箱子，看见那孩子。孩子哭了，她就可怜他，我们对法老的女儿有哪些了解？说：「这是希伯来人的一个孩子。」法老的女儿意识到了什么？
7孩子的姊姊对法老的女儿说：「我去在希伯来妇人中叫一个奶妈来，为你奶这孩子，可以不可以？」谁来到法老的女儿面前？
8法老的女儿说：「可以。」童女就去叫了孩子的母亲来。9法老的女儿对她说：「你把这孩子抱去，为我奶他，我必给你工价。」妇人就抱了孩子去奶他。做了哪些事使这个孩子得救？10孩子渐长，妇人把他带到法老的女儿那里，就作了她的儿子。作了她的儿子是什么意思？这个孩子将接受什么样的教育？还会有哪些好处？她给孩子起名叫摩西，意思说：「因我把他从水里拉出来。」

kecheng: Moses Flees to Midian
    11 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. What was Moses learning about his people? He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. What does Moses know about his heritage?  12 Looking this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. Why would Moses try to hide his deed? 13 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?” Why would Moses ask this question?
   14 The man said, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?”Why did this answer surprise Moses? Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.” What reality must Moses face?
   15 When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, Why do you think the Pharaoh would try to kill his daughter's son? but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well. 16 Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock. What job did the daugher have? 17 Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. How did Moses help?
   18 When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?” What was unusual?
   19 They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.” What did the daughters call Moses?
   20 “And where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.” What did the father want to show Moses?
   21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. How did the father thank Moses? 22 Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.” What do you think "Gershom" means?
摩西逃往米甸
11后来，摩西长大，他出去到他弟兄那里，看他们的重担，摩西对他自己的族人有哪些了解？见一个埃及人打希伯来人的一个弟兄。摩西对他本民族的传统有哪些了解？12他左右观看，见没有人，就把埃及人打死了，藏在沙土里。摩西为什么要隐藏自己的行为？13第二天他出去，见有两个希伯来人争斗，就对那欺负人的说：「你为什么打你同族的人呢？」摩西为什么问这个问题？
14那人说：「谁立你作我们的首领和审判官呢？难道你要杀我，像杀那埃及人吗？」为什么这个问题使摩西感到惊讶？摩西便惧怕，说：「这事必是被人知道了。」摩西必须面临什么现实问题？
15法老听见这事，就想杀摩西，你认为法老为什么想要杀他女儿的儿子？但摩西躲避法老，逃往米甸地居住。16一日，他在井旁坐下。米甸的祭司有七个女儿；她们来打水，打满了槽，要饮父亲的群羊。这些女儿是做什么的？17有牧羊的人来，把她们赶走了，摩西却起来帮助她们，又饮了她们的群羊。摩西怎样帮助她们的？
18她们来到父亲流珥那里；他说：「今日你们为何来得这么快呢？」有什么不寻常的事？19她们说：「有一个埃及人救我们脱离牧羊人的手，并且为我们打水饮了群羊。」她们是怎么称呼摩西的？
20他对女儿们说：「那个人在哪里？你们为什么撇下他呢？你们去请他来吃饭。」这个父亲想要向摩西表达怎样的态度？
21摩西甘心和那人同住；那人把他的女儿西坡拉给摩西为妻。这个父亲怎样感谢摩西的？22西坡拉生了一个儿子，摩西给他起名叫革舜，意思说：「因我在外邦作了寄居的。」你认为“革舜”意为着什么？

kecheng: God Hears Israel's Groaning
   23 During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. What did the change in ruler mean? 24 God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. Who was Abraham? Isaac? Jacob?  25 So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them. What 4 words in verses 24 and 25 tell us God remembered the Israelites? Had the Lord ever stopped hearing them? Explain your reason.
神听见以色列人的哀声
23过了多年，埃及王死了。以色列人因做苦工，就叹息哀求，他们的哀声达于　神。掌权者的变化意味着什么？24神听见他们的哀声，就记念他与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各是谁？25神看顾以色列人，也知道他们的苦情。在24节和25节中有那四个词告诉我们神记念以色列人？神是否曾停止聆听他们的呼求？解释你的理由？
