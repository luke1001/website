Exodus 17:1-16
出埃及记17:1-16
            When Israel runs out of water, they grumble instead of turning to God, their Rock, for help. God in His graciousness does not deal with them according to their folly but furnishes the water they desperately need. Israel learns firsthand as they fight enemies such as Amalek that success depends on the Lord.
当以色列人没有水时，他们就发怨言而不是转向神，他们的磐石，来寻求帮助。神在祂的恩慈里没有按照他们的愚昧来对待他们，而是供给他们所急需的水。以色列人在直接面对敌人，如亚玛力人，打仗时，学到了他们的胜利依赖于神。
kecheng: Water From the Rock
   1 The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. How far had Israel come on their journey from Egypt? 2 So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." What prompted the people of Israel to complain strongly against Moses? Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?" 3 But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?" Of what did the people accuse God? 4 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? Why didn't Moses call them "my people" or "Your people"? They are almost ready to stone me." How did this complaint compare with the previous complaints Israel raised and God addressed in chapters 15 and 16? 5 The LORD answered Moses, "Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. What did the staff symbolize?  Why take the elders? 6 I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Who was present? Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. What did the Lord once again show the people? 7 And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?" What are some other ways in which people wrongly "test" God?
磐石出水
1以色列全会众都遵耶和华的吩咐，按着站口从汛的旷野往前行，在利非订安营。百姓没有水喝，以色列人从埃及地出来后行走了多远？2所以与摩西争闹，说：「给我们水喝吧！」什么促使以色列人向摩西大发怨言？摩西对他们说：「你们为什么与我争闹？为什么试探耶和华呢？」3百姓在那里甚渴，要喝水，就向摩西发怨言，说：「你为什么将我们从埃及领出来，使我们和我们的儿女并牲畜都渴死呢？」这些人指责神什么？4摩西就呼求耶和华说：「我向这百姓怎样行呢？为什么摩西不把他们成为“我的民”或“你的民”？他们几乎要拿石头打死我。」请比较这一次的怨言和前一次在15和16章中记载的以色列人对神的怨言？5耶和华对摩西说：「你手里拿着你先前击打河水的杖，带领以色列的几个长老，从百姓面前走过去。杖预表什么？为什么要带长老一起去？6我必在何烈的磐石那里，站在你面前。你要击打磐石，从磐石里必有水流出来，使百姓可以喝。」摩西就在以色列的长老眼前这样行了。神再一次向人表现出了什么？7他给那地方起名叫玛撒，又叫米利巴；因以色列人争闹，又因他们试探耶和华，说：「耶和华是在我们中间不是？」人们还有哪些错误的方式来“试探”神？

kecheng: The Amalekites Defeated
   8 The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. Why might the Amalekites attack the Israelites? What else do we learn about the Amalekites in Deuteronomy 25:17-19? 9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands." How many men went out to battle? 10 So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. What gave the Israelites an advantage? 12 When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up--one on one side, one on the other--so that his hands remained steady till sunset. How was Moses helped during the battle? 13 So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. What point did the hymn writer Daniel March make with the words:
            With your prayers and with you off'rings you can do what God demands;
            You can be like faithful Aaron, holding up the prophet's hand.
kecheng:    14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven." What is the future of the Amaleks? 15 Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner. What was the reason for building an altar? 16 He said, "For hands were lifted up to the throne of the LORD. The LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."
击败亚玛力人
8那时，亚玛力人来在利非订，和以色列人争战。亚玛力人为什么要攻击以色列人？我们从申命记25:17-19中对亚玛力人还有哪些了解？9摩西对约书亚说：「你为我们选出人来，出去和亚玛力人争战。明天我手里要拿着　神的杖，站在山顶上。」有多少人出去打仗？10于是约书亚照着摩西对他所说的话行，和亚玛力人争战。摩西、亚伦，与户珥都上了山顶。11摩西何时举手，以色列人就得胜，何时垂手，亚玛力人就得胜。什么使以色列人得胜？12但摩西的手发沉，他们就搬石头来，放在他以下，他就坐在上面。亚伦与户珥扶着他的手，一个在这边，一个在那边，他的手就稳住，直到日落的时候。在战斗中摩西得到怎样的帮助？13约书亚用刀杀了亚玛力王和他的百姓。Daniel March是赞美诗的作者，他写下的这些词表达了什么意思?
            藉着你的祷告和你的奉献，你能做神所愿的任何事；
你可以像忠信的亚伦一样，扶着先知的手。
 14 耶和华对摩西说：「我要将亚玛力的名号从天下全然涂抹了；你要将这话写在书上作纪念，又念给约书亚听。」亚玛力人将有怎样的结局？15摩西筑了一座坛，起名叫「耶和华尼西」，筑坛的原因是什么？16又说：「耶和华已经起了誓，必世世代代和亚玛力人争战。」
