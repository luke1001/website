Exodus 15:1-27
出埃及记15:1-27
            Moses praises the Lord for victory and anticipates future victories. Crossing the Red Sea strengthened the Israelites faith and awakened within them a spirit of deep gratitude. The focus of the song is God himself.
摩西为着胜利和将来的胜利赞美神。过红海坚立了以色列人的信心并且在他们心中唤起了深深地感激。这首诗歌的中心是神自己。
            One of the traits of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, the balancing of ideas. At times (1) the second half of a verse essentially restates the thought of the first half, (2) the second half of a verse says the opposite of the first half, (3) the second half of a verse expands on the thought of the first half.
希伯来文学的一个特点是平行，对主题的平衡。下列情形都常出现(1)一句话的下半部分实际上和上本部分的内容相关，(2)一句话的下半部分讲述与上半部分相反的内容，(3)一句话的下班不凡补充说明上半部分的内容。
kecheng: The Song of Moses and Miriam
    1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:
   “I will sing to the LORD,
   for he is highly exalted.
Both horse and driver
   he has hurled into the sea.
   2 “The LORD is my strength and my defense;
   he has become my salvation. Describe the Lord.
He is my God, and I will praise him,
   my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
3 The LORD is a warrior;
   the LORD is his name. How else is the Lord described?
4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his army
   he has hurled into the sea.
The best of Pharaoh’s officers
   are drowned in the Red Sea.
5 The deep waters have covered them;
   they sank to the depths like a stone. What is the theme of these first five verses?
摩西和米利暗的歌
1那时，摩西和以色列人向耶和华唱歌说：
我要向耶和华歌唱，
因他大大战胜，
将马和骑马的投在海中。
2耶和华是我的力量，我的诗歌，
也成了我的拯救。请你描述耶和华
这是我的　神，我要赞美他，
是我父亲的　神，我要尊崇他。
3耶和华是战士；
他的名是耶和华。耶和华还被如何记述？
4法老的车辆、军兵，
耶和华已抛在海中；
他特选的军长都沉于红海。
5深水淹没他们；
他们如同石头坠到深处。这五节经文的主题是什么？
kecheng: 6 Your right hand, LORD,
   was majestic in power.
Your right hand, LORD,
   shattered the enemy.
   7 “In the greatness of your majesty
   you threw down those who opposed you.
You unleashed your burning anger;
   it consumed them like stubble.
8 By the blast of your nostrils
   the waters piled up. What is "the blast of your nostrils"? See Ex. 14:21
The surging waters stood up like a wall;
   the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
9 The enemy boasted,
   ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them.
I will divide the spoils;
   I will gorge myself on them.
I will draw my sword
   and my hand will destroy them.’ What does "I will" indicate?
10 But you blew with your breath,
   and the sea covered them.
They sank like lead
   in the mighty waters.  What is the theme of verses 6-10?
kecheng: 6耶和华啊，你的右手施展能力，显出荣耀；
耶和华啊，你的右手摔碎仇敌。
7你大发威严，推翻那些起来攻击你的；
你发出烈怒如火，烧灭他们像烧碎秸一样。
8你发鼻中的气，水便聚起成堆，什么是“发鼻中的气”?参看出14:21
大水直立如垒，海中的深水凝结。
9仇敌说：我要追赶，我要追上；
我要分掳物，我要在他们身上称我的心愿。
我要拔出刀来，亲手杀灭他们。“我要”说明了什么?
10你叫风一吹，海就把他们淹没；
他们如铅沉在大水之中。6-10节的主题是什么？
kecheng: kecheng: 11 Who among the gods
   is like you, LORD?
Who is like you—
   majestic in holiness,
awesome in glory,
   working wonders? What is God's unique status?
   12 “You stretch out your right hand,
   and the earth swallows your enemies.
13 In your unfailing love you will lead
   the people you have redeemed.
In your strength you will guide them
   to your holy dwelling. What do you think is "your holy dwelling"?
14 The nations will hear and tremble;
   anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
15 The chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
   the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling,
the peopleof Canaan will melt away;
   16 terror and dread will fall on them. Who are the people of Philistia, chiefs of Edom, leaders of Moab and the people of Canaan?
By the power of your arm
   they will be as still as a stone—
until your people pass by, LORD,
   until the people you boughtpass by. What does it mean for the people to pass by?
17 You will bring them in and plant them
   on the mountain of your inheritance— What is the inheritance?
the place, LORD, you made for your dwelling,
   the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. This can be referring to the temple that will be built by King Solomon. It can also mean Jerusalem, Israel, or the Christian Church God has established.
   18 “The LORD reigns
   for ever and ever.” For how long will the Lord reign? What is the theme for verses 11-18?
kecheng: 11耶和华啊，众神之中，谁能像你？
谁能像你—至圣至荣，可颂可畏，施行奇事？耶和华有怎样独特的地位？
12你伸出右手，地便吞灭他们。
13你凭慈爱领了你所赎的百姓；
你凭能力引他们到了你的圣所。你认为“你的圣所”是什么？
14外邦人听见就发颤；
疼痛抓住非利士的居民。
15那时，以东的族长惊惶，
摩押的英雄被战兢抓住，
迦南的居民心都消化了。
16惊骇恐惧临到他们。非利士的居民是什么人？以东的族长、摩押的英雄、迦南的居民分别是什么人？
耶和华啊，因你膀臂的大能，
他们如石头寂然不动，
等候你的百姓过去，
等候你所赎的百姓过去。“过去”的意思是什么？
17你要将他们领进去，
栽于你产业的山上—“产业”是什么？
耶和华啊，就是你为自己所造的住处；
主啊，就是你手所建立的圣所。这里可能指着所罗门王将来要建的圣殿所说的。也可能是指耶路撒冷、以色列或神所建立的基督教会。
18耶和华必作王，
直到永永远远！神的统治是多长时间？11-18节的主题是什么？
kecheng:    19 When Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemenwent into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. What is summarized in verse 19 ? 20 Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing. What do you remember about Miriam? (Hint, see Exodus 2:1-4.) 21 Miriam sang to them:
   “Sing to the LORD,
   for he is highly exalted.
Both horse and driver
   he has hurled into the sea.” What did Miriam add to the praise of the Lord?
How does Moses and Miriam's song help us better understand what God is like?
What are some events in your life that calls praise and celebration to the Lord?
kecheng: 19法老的马匹、车辆，和马兵下到海中，耶和华使海水回流，淹没他们；惟有以色列人在海中走干地。19节中做了怎样的总结？20亚伦的姊姊，女先知米利暗，手里拿着鼓；众妇女也跟她出去拿鼓跳舞。你还记得米利暗吗？（提示参看出埃及记2:1-4）21米利暗应声说：
你们要歌颂耶和华，
因他大大战胜，
将马和骑马的投在海中。米利暗向神有怎样的赞美？摩西和米利暗的诗歌会如何帮助我们更明白神自己？在你的生命中有哪些事会使你向神赞美、庆祝？

kecheng: The Waters of Marah and Elim
    22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. What challenge did the children of Israel find when they traveled into the desert?       23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. Why would the people not drink the water at Marah? 24 So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”What is the response of the people?
   25 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink. How did God provide for His people in need?
   There the LORD issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test. 26 He said, “If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.” What was God trying to accomplish by His decree?
   27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.  How did the Lord provide for the Children of Israel as they began their journey to the Promised Land?
 玛拉的苦水和以琳
22摩西领以色列人从红海往前行，到了书珥的旷野，在旷野走了三天，找不着水。当以色列人走到旷野时他们遇到了什么挑战? 23到了玛拉，不能喝那里的水；因为水苦，所以那地名叫玛拉。人们为什么不能喝玛拉的水？24百姓就向摩西发怨言，说：「我们喝什么呢？」人们的反应如何？
25摩西呼求耶和华，耶和华指示他一棵树。他把树丢在水里，水就变甜了。神是如何供应祂的子民的需要的？
耶和华在那里为他们定了律例、典章，在那里试验他们；26又说：「你若留意听耶和华—你　神的话，又行我眼中看为正的事，留心听我的诫命，守我一切的律例，我就不将所加与埃及人的疾病加在你身上，因为我—耶和华是医治你的。」神要借祂的命令完成什么目的？
27他们到了以琳，在那里有十二股水泉，七十棵棕树；他们就在那里的水边安营。在以色列人开始走向应许之地的旅程中，神是如何供应祂的子民的？
