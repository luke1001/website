Exodus 19:1-25
出埃及记19:1-25
            In the desert, on their way to the Land of Promise, God made a covenant with His people at Mount Sinai (Mt Horeb). Sinfulness prevents the people from approaching God personally. Yet God graciously appoints an intermediary, Moses, through whom He makes His covenant (a mutual agreement between two or more parties) with His people.
在旷野中，在他们去应许之地的路上，神在西奈山（何烈山）上与祂的子民立约。罪性阻止人们亲身来到神面前。然而神满有恩典的指派了一位中介，摩西，藉着他神与祂的子民立约（在两方或多方之间所要共同遵守的协议）。
kecheng: At Mount Sinai
    1 On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt—on that very day—they came to the Desert of Sinai. 2 After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain. When and where did God bring the people of Israel to establish His covenant with them?
   3 Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel: 4 ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. What is the first thing God wanted Moses to tell the Israelites? 5 Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. What responsibilities would Israel have in this covenant relationship? Although the whole earth is mine, 6 youwill be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.” What great rewards would Israel receive for their obedience? What job did priests have? What is a holy nation?
以色列人在西奈山
1以色列人出埃及地以后，满了三个月的那一天，就来到西奈的旷野。2他们离了利非订，来到西奈的旷野，就在那里的山下安营。神是在什么时候，什么地点带领以色列人来与他们立约的？
3摩西到　神那里，耶和华从山上呼唤他说：「你要这样告诉雅各家，晓谕以色列人说：4『我向埃及人所行的事，你们都看见了，且看见我如鹰将你们背在翅膀上，带来归我。神要摩西告诉以色列人的第一件事是什么？5如今你们若实在听从我的话，遵守我的约，就要在万民中作属我的子民，以色列人在这个约的关系中所有的责任是什么？因为全地都是我的。6你们要归我作祭司的国度，为圣洁的国民。』这些话你要告诉以色列人。」以色列人的顺服将带给他们什么样的奖赏？祭祀的工作是什么？什么是圣洁的国民？
7 So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak. 8 The people all responded together, “We will do everything the LORD has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD. How did the Israelites respond to God's covenant terms?
   9 The LORD said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said. What would be the benefit of God coming to Moses in a cloud as He spoke to the Israelites?
   10 And the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes 11 and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 12 Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful that you do not approach the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death. 13 They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.” What consecration preparations were the people of Israel to make? Why did God make the threat to put to death anyone who approached or touched the foot of the mountain?
   14 After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. What does it mean for a person to be "consecrated" to God? 15 Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.” Why would Moses ask the people to abstain from sexual relations after their clothes are washed?
7摩西去召了民间的长老来，将耶和华所吩咐他的话都在他们面前陈明。8百姓都同声回答说：「凡耶和华所说的，我们都要遵行。」摩西就将百姓的话回复耶和华。以色列人是如何回应神给他们的约的条款的?
9耶和华对摩西说：「我要在密云中临到你那里，叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见，也可以永远信你了。」于是，摩西将百姓的话奏告耶和华。神在密云中临到摩西向以色列人说话有什么益处？
10耶和华又对摩西说：「你往百姓那里去，叫他们今天明天自洁，又叫他们洗衣服。11到第三天要预备好了，因为第三天耶和华要在众百姓眼前降临在西奈山上。12你要在山的四围给百姓定界限，说：『你们当谨慎，不可上山去，也不可摸山的边界；凡摸这山的，必要治死他。13不可用手摸他，必用石头打死，或用箭射透；无论是人是牲畜，都不得活。到角声拖长的时候，他们才可到山根来。』」以色列人要做怎样的洁净的预备？神为什么要警告任何人到山的边界或摸山的边界将被处死？
14摩西下山往百姓那里去，叫他们自洁，他们就洗衣服。向神“自洁”是什么意思？15他对百姓说：「到第三天要预备好了。不可亲近女人。」摩西为什么要人在洗衣服后不可亲近女人？
16 On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. 17 Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 18 Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountaintrembled violently. 19 As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him. What did God do to reveal His presence at Mt. Sinai?
   20 The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up 21 and the LORD said to him, “Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish. 22 Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them.” Why would God repeat His previous instructions?
   23 Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’”
   24 The LORD replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them.” What instruction did God give Moses when they first met at the top of Mt. Sinai? Why bring up Aaron?
25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
16到了第三天早晨，在山上有雷轰、闪电，和密云，并且角声甚大，营中的百姓尽都发颤。17摩西率领百姓出营迎接　神，都站在山下。18西奈全山冒烟，因为耶和华在火中降于山上。山的烟气上腾，如烧窑一般，遍山大大地震动。19角声渐渐地高而又高，摩西就说话，　神有声音答应他。神做了什么来显明祂在西奈山上的临在的？
20耶和华降临在西奈山顶上，耶和华召摩西上山顶，摩西就上去。21耶和华对摩西说：「你下去嘱咐百姓，不可闯过来到我面前观看，恐怕他们有多人死亡；22又叫亲近我的祭司自洁，恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。」神为什么重复祂之前的指示？
23摩西对耶和华说：「百姓不能上西奈山，因为你已经嘱咐我们说：『要在山的四围定界限，叫山成圣。』」24耶和华对他说：「下去吧，你要和亚伦一同上来；只是祭司和百姓不可闯过来上到我面前，恐怕我忽然出来击杀他们。」摩西第一次在西奈山上与神相见时，神给了摩西什么指示？为什么要带亚伦一同上来？
25于是摩西下到百姓那里告诉他们。
kecheng: Notes注释
First day of the third month - Late May or early June
满了三个月的那一天– 五月末或六月初
kecheng: Desert of Sinai - Located in the southeast region of the peninsula. It is thought to be the highest of all the mountain ranges in that vicinity. It rises abruptly, so that the granite rocks could be touched by one standing at the base. The mountain is completely surrounded by a deep valley, large enough for the assembly of two million Israelites, and fed by four running streams, so that the people had sufficient water for themselves and also pasturage for their cattle.
西奈的旷野–位于半岛的东南处。这被认为是在那里附近山脉中的最高点。其地陡峭，人在山脚下可以摸到突起的岩石。山的周围被深谷环绕，足够容纳两百万的以色列会众，并且还有四股溪水，因此人们有足够的水源供给自己和他们的牲畜。
