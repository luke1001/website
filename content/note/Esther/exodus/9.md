Exodus 9:1-35
出埃及记9:1-35
 
Despite the false promises of Pharaoh, God will not be mocked. God deals another blow to the Egyptian religious and economic systems.
尽管法老做出虚假的应许，神是轻慢不得的。神再次打击了埃及人的宗教和经济。
 
The Plague on Livestock
    1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.” What familiar message does God give Moses? 2 If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, 3 the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats. Describe the fifth plague.
4 But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’”Who will not be afflicted by the plague?
   5 The LORD set a time and said, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land.”
6And the next day the LORD did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. How devastating was the plague to the Israelites? 
7Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. What Pharaoh's investigation find? Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go. Why would Pharaoh continue to "not let the people go"?
畜疫之灾           
1耶和华吩咐摩西说：「你进去见法老，对他说：『耶和华—希伯来人的　神这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。神给摩西的是怎样的一个我们所熟悉的信息？2 你若不肯容他们去，仍旧强留他们，3 耶和华的手加在你田间的牲畜上，就是在马、驴、骆驼、牛群、羊群上，必有重重的瘟疫。请描述第五灾。
4耶和华要分别以色列的牲畜和埃及的牲畜，凡属以色列人的，一样都不死。』」哪些人将不受这一灾的影响？
5耶和华就定了时候，说：「明天耶和华必在此地行这事。」6第二天，耶和华就行这事。埃及的牲畜几乎都死了，只是以色列人的牲畜，一个都没有死。这一灾对以色利人造成了怎样的破坏？
7法老打发人去看，谁知以色列人的牲畜连一个都没有死。法老的心却是固执，不容百姓去。法老为什么仍然“不容百姓去”？
 
Notes注释
Terrible plague - Possibly murrain, similar to anthrax, causing a contagious fever affecting domestic animals, killing them soon upon being attacked.
重重的瘟疫 - 可能是一种家畜传染病，与炭疽病相似，可以使家畜传染发热，使它们很快致死。
 
Livestock - The Egyptians worshipped many animals, including the bull-gods Apis and Mnevis, cow-god Hathor, and ram-god Khnum. 
牲畜 - 埃及人敬拜多种动物，包括公牛神 Apis和Mnevis,母牛神Hathor以及公羊神Khnum
 
The Plague of Boils
    8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. 9 It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.” What was the next plague God sent, this time without advance notice?
   10 So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. 11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians. How did the boils affect the magicians? 12 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses. What difference occurred in Pharaoh's hardening of the heart?
疮灾
8耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦说：「你们取几捧炉灰，摩西要在法老面前向天扬起来。9这灰要在埃及全地变作尘土，在人身上和牲畜身上成了起泡的疮。」神接下来没有预警的施行了什么灾难？
10摩西、亚伦取了炉灰，站在法老面前。摩西向天扬起来，就在人身上和牲畜身上成了起泡的疮。11行法术的在摩西面前站立不住，因为在他们身上和一切埃及人身上都有这疮。这一灾难怎样影响到行法术的人？12 耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不听他们，正如耶和华对摩西所说的。这一次法老是如何不同的硬着心？
 
What did this development in Pharaoh's hardening mean for him?
这一次法老的硬心的进展对他来说意味着什么？
 
Notes注释
Soot from a furnace - Casting ashes from the altars of their idol temples was a rite which the Egyptians observed to stop evil; God turns it into reverse.
炉灰 - 埃及人将炉灰从他们的偶像祭坛上扬起，作为他们阻止邪灵的的仪式。神使用这一点反过来攻击埃及人。
 
Boils - Skin swollen in abscesses and blisters.
疮 - 皮肤上产生脓及水泡。
 
The Plague of Hail
    13 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me, What demand does Moses make?14 or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. What warning does the Lord give the Pharaoh? For what reason?
How does a recognition of God's ownership of and rule over all things help believers?15 For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. 16 But I have raised you upfor this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. Why has the Lord not struck Pharaoh and his people dead?17 You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. 18 Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. 19 Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’” Describe the seventh plague.
   20 Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside. What did the reaction of Pharaoh's officials to God's threat reveal? 21 But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
   22 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.” 23 When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt; 24 hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 25 Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. Describe the storm. 26 The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. Where did the storm not fall?
   27 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. 28 Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.” As you examine Pharaoh's confession and promise, what appears to be missing?
   29 Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD’s. 30 But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God.” What does Moses know about Pharaoh's heart?
What important lesson should Pharaoh have learned from the plague of hail?
   31 (The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom. 32 The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
   33 Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. What happened when Moses prayed to the Lord? 34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts. 35 So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses. What did Pharaoh's refusal to let the Israelites reveal about his spiritual?
雹灾
13耶和华对摩西说：「你清早起来，站在法老面前，对他说：『耶和华—希伯来人的　神这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。摩西提出了什么要求？14 因为这一次我要叫一切的灾殃临到你和你臣仆并你百姓的身上，叫你知道在普天下没有像我的。神给法老什么样的警告？为什么？认识到神拥有一切、掌管一切对信徒来说有什么样的帮助？
15我若伸手用瘟疫攻击你和你的百姓，你早就从地上除灭了。16其实，我叫你存立，是特要向你显我的大能，并要使我的名传遍天下。神为什么没有除灭法老和他的百姓？17你还向我的百姓自高，不容他们去吗？18到明天约在这时候，我必叫重大的冰雹降下，自从埃及开国以来，没有这样的冰雹。19 现在你要打发人把你的牲畜和你田间一切所有的催进来；凡在田间不收回家的，无论是人是牲畜，冰雹必降在他们身上，他们就必死。』」请描述第七灾。
20法老的臣仆中，惧怕耶和华这话的，便叫他的奴仆和牲畜跑进家来。法老的臣仆如何回应神的警告？21但那不把耶和华这话放在心上的，就将他的奴仆和牲畜留在田里。
 22 耶和华对摩西说：「你向天伸杖，使埃及遍地的人身上和牲畜身上，并田间各样菜蔬上，都有冰雹。」23摩西向天伸杖，耶和华就打雷下雹，有火闪到地上；耶和华下雹在埃及地上。24那时，雹与火搀杂，甚是厉害，自从埃及成国以来，遍地没有这样的。25在埃及遍地，雹击打了田间所有的人和牲畜，并一切的菜蔬，又打坏田间一切的树木。请描述这场冰雹。26惟独以色列人所住的歌珊地没有冰雹。冰雹没有击打哪里？
 27法老打发人召摩西、亚伦来，对他们说：「这一次我犯了罪了。耶和华是公义的；我和我的百姓是邪恶的。28这雷轰和冰雹已经够了。请你们求耶和华，我就容你们去，不再留住你们。」请你分析法老的认罪和承诺，你认为其中缺少了什么？
29摩西对他说：「我一出城，就要向耶和华举手祷告；雷必止住，也不再有冰雹，叫你知道全地都是属耶和华的。30至于你和你的臣仆，我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华　神。」摩西对法老的心思有什么了解？
法老应该从雹灾中学到什么重要的功课？
（31 那时，麻和大麦被雹击打；因为大麦已经吐穗，麻也开了花。32只是小麦和粗麦没有被击打，因为还没有长成。）33摩西离了法老出城，向耶和华举手祷告；雷和雹就止住，雨也不再浇在地上了。法老向神祷告后发生了什么？34法老见雨和雹与雷止住，就越发犯罪；他和他的臣仆都硬着心。35法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人去，正如耶和华借着摩西所说的。法老拒绝以色列人离开，反映出他灵里的情形如何？
