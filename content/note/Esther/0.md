The Book of Esther is a beautiful portrayal of courage in the face of danger and the triumph of good in the face of evil. In this book we learn how God used Esther to save the people of Israel from destruction. Although the name of God is not mentioned, the Book of Esther implies divine providence throughout.

以斯帖记这卷书成功地展现了临危不惧，化险为夷，以善制恶为主题的画面。在这卷书中，我们认识到神怎样使用以斯帖来拯救以色列民免遭灭绝之灾。虽然这卷书中没有提到神的名字，但神的旨意贯穿着整卷书。

The events in the book of Esther occurred from 483 BC to 473 BC, during the first half of the reign of King Xerxes, who chose Esther as his queen. During this time period, the first remnant of Jews who had returned to Judah认识到 were struggling to reestablish temple worship according to the Law of Moses. But Esther and Mordecai, along with many other Jews, had chosen not to make the trek back to Judah. They seemed content to stay in Susa, the capital city of Persia, in which the story is set.

以斯帖记书中的事件发生在公元前483年 至公元前473年，在亚哈随鲁王统治时期的前半部分，他挑选以斯帖做王后。在此期间，已经返回犹大的首批犹太余民正在努力根据摩西律法重建圣殿敬拜神。但是以斯帖和末底改随同许多其他犹太人，没有选择长途跋涉回犹大。他们似乎安于留在波斯的都城，书珊城，即故事发生的地方。

The purpose of the book is to record the Lord's deliverance of the Jewish people still living in Persia. The unknown author of the book of Esther was most likely a Jew very familiar with the royal Persian court. The detailed descriptions of court life and traditions, as well as the events that occurred in the book, point to an eyewitness author. 

此书的目的是记录神对仍然生活在波斯的犹太子民的拯救。以斯帖记的佚名作者极可能是一位非常熟悉波斯皇宫的犹太人。从有关皇宫生活和传统的详细描述，以及发生在本书中的事件都表明是作者的亲眼见证。
