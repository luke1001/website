Memorable quotes are a very effective way of remembering important thoughts. Following are some quotes on the subject of leadership. They come from secular (world) and Christian sources and they offer insights into this important topic.

著名的引言是记忆重要思想的很有效的方法。下面是一些关于领导力的引言，不论它们来自世人或是基督徒都给我们这个重要的主题带来启示的亮光。

Ministry (the on-going work of the church and individual Christians) = MESSAGE (the Word of God) + messengers (people or ways in which the Word is shared with the world).

福音事工(不论教会还是每个基督徒一直努力着的工作)=福音信息(上帝的话语)+传福音（把神的话分享给世人的人或方法）

THE MESSAGE is unchangeable, constant and eternal. It remains the same for all people for all time just as Jesus, our Savior is “the same yesterday, today and forever.” (Hebrews 13:8)

福音信息是不可改变、恒常和永存的。不论在何时、对何人福音信息都是如此：我们的救主耶稣基督“昨日今日，一直到永远，是一样的。”（希伯来书13:8）

The messengers change according to gifts and abilities of individual people and in different ways in which the Word is to be shared. Leadership falls under the category of “messengers.”

传福音则要根据每个人的恩赐和能力的不同或神话语传达的方式不同而改变。基督徒的领导力从属于“传福音”的范畴以内。


##### QUOTES ON LEADERSHIP…WHAT’S THE POINT?  关于领袖的引言……意义何在？


EXERCISE: Read each quote and ask the good Lutheran question: What Does This Mean?…or What’s the point? and then make application to your context.

练习：阅读每个引言并且提出很好的路德式问题：这话是什么意思？……或者说意义何在？然后运用在自己的处境中。

Dr. Martin Luther, 16th century reformer of the Christian Church, wrote a Small Catechism as a simple way for parents to teach children the important truths of God’s Word. Each statement of truth was followed with the question: “what does this mean?” and then proceeded to explain in easy words the truth presented. What does this mean? is a good question for us as Christians to ask regularly and we want to do so with each quote below in order to talk about the deeper and fuller meaning of each quote. Let’s have some fun discussing these.

16世纪的教会改革者马丁路德博士所著的《教理问答》，提供了一个简洁的方式来让父母向孩子们教授重要的圣经真理。跟随每则真理的信息之后都有这样一个问题“这话是什么意思？”然后用简单的话语把真理呈现出来。“这话是什么意思？”是一个我们基督徒常常要问的好问题。下面我们就想对每一个引言这样提问，从而将每个引言的含义都探讨得更深、更全。让我们开始有趣的讨论吧。

1.    He who thinketh he leadeth but hath noone following him only taketh a walk.

    一个人以为他在带领会众却无人跟随，他只是管自独行而已。

    The most popular translation of the Bible into English that existed for several hundred years is referred to as the King James Version, translated in 1511. It used the “king’s English” which uses the “th” with the verb forms. Thus “thinketh” instead of thinks, and “leadeth” instead of leads. Using the King James English in this quote is intended to lend some humor to it.

    最受欢迎的圣经英译本是数百年前的英皇钦定本，翻译于1511年，它所用的“标准英语”将单词加上“th”成为动词形式，因此在这个引言里用“thinkth”代替"thinks"，"leadth"代替"leads"在这里使用标准英语是为了给其增加些幽默感。

    What does it mean? The quote is simply saying that if you think or assume you are a leader but you have no followers, that is, no one is working or serving with you, you are not leading but you are “only taking a walk,” you are only serving yourself. Little will be accomplished. A leaders first task is to make sure he/she has people serving with him/her. Jesus gathered his disciples and then he led/taught them.

    这话是什么意思？这个引言简单的表达了如果你臆想成为领导但却没有追随者，就是说，没有人和你同工或一同服事，那么你并不是在带领而只是“在散步”你只在服事你自己，毫无建树，带领人的首要任务就是确认他有同工一同服事。耶稣呼召门徒以后就带领并教导他们。

2.    Leaders are to be more like thermostats than thermometers.

    领袖们要更多地起到调温计的作用，非温度计而已。


    A thermometer is an instrument that reads the temperature. It tells you whether it is “hot” or “cold” outside or inside. But it has no power or ability to “change” the temperature.

    温度计是用来显示温度的仪器。它会告诉你室内外的温度是“热”还是“凉”，它没有能力来改变温度。

    A thermostat is an instrument or control (in a home or office) that “sets” or “changes” the temperature. Set it higher and it heats the home. Set it cooler and it cools the home.

    恒温器是用来控制（家中或办公场所）预设或改变温度的仪器。调高就会加热房屋，调冷就会使房间变凉。

    Leaders need to be able not only to “read” the conditions around them but also to “change” them (for the better). Thus it could be said that “Leaders are to be both thermometers (reading the conditions that exist) and thermostats (changing things for the better...guided by God’s Word).

    领袖就需要不仅能读出周围环境的温度也要能够作出改变（向好的方面）。因此可以这样说“领袖不仅是温度计（明白存在的环境）而且要成为恒温器（把事情改变的更好，在神话语的引领之下）”

3.    He who is two or three steps ahead of his people is a leader. He who is twenty or thirty yards ahead is a target.

    两三步先行于众人，他就是一个领袖。二三十码远离众人，他就成为一个目标。


    Leadership means being ahead of your people, leading them forward in Christ, but not too far ahead so that people don’t know where you are leading them. If you get too far ahead of your people you could become a “target,” that is a person that is criticized and ridiculed and rejected. Remain close to the people you are leading by knowing and caring about them and, above all, by leading them into the life-giving and life-changing Word of God.

    带领意味者要先行于跟随者，带领他们朝向耶稣，但不要离得太远免得跟随的人不知道你在哪里带领他们。如果你距跟随者太远，就会成为一个箭靶，成为被批评、嘲笑和丢弃的人物。认识并关心你的跟随者就是和他们在一起，尤其是带领他们来到赐生命的主和改变生命的神话语的面前。

4.    A leader is not someone who can do the work of 10 people but one who can involve 10 people in the work.

    一个领袖，不在于他能做十人份的工作，而在于他能够在这份工作中影响十个人。


    The goal of a leader is not just to get the work done but involving people in the process. By involving and training more people you are preparing more people for leadership who in turn can train more people for getting the work done. Jesus trained 12 disciples for three years so that they could train others to share the Gospel with the world! We need to “multiply” the number of leaders in order to get more ministry accomplished.

    领袖的目标不仅仅在于把工作完成而是要把人们带到进程中。通过吸引和训练更多的人进入，你就在预备更多带领的人又能训练多人来把工作完成。耶稣在地上用了三年时间训练了12个使徒，好让他们也能训练别人来与世人分享临到世界的好消息！我们需要倍增领袖的数目来完成更多的福音事工。

5.    A leader is a person with a magnet in his heart and a compass in his head.

    一个领袖，心中有磁石、头脑中有罗盘。


    A magnet draws or attracts medal to itself. A leader is to be a magnet who attracts people to himself or his message. A compass is used to find or give directions. A leader is to give direction and purpose to the work. In terms of ministry, our goal as leaders is to draw people to Jesus (and us) and to direct them “forward in Christ” in carrying out His calling. It is not an “either or” , that is, either a “magnet” or a “compass” but it is a “both and”, that is both a “magnet” and and “compass.”

    磁石把金属吸向自己。领袖要成为磁石来吸引人们到他那里或他的所讲的信息，罗盘是用来发现和指明方向的。领导要给出工作的方向和目的。在福音事工方面，领袖的目标就是把人拉向耶稣（和我们）并指导他们“在基督里努力”完成祂的呼召。这并不是“两者择其一”即可，就如，或者成为磁石或者成为罗盘，而是两者都是，既要是磁石也要是罗盘。

6.    Nothing so conclusively proves a man’s ability to lead others as what he does from day to day to lead himself.

    没有任何事能比一个人每天如何带领自己更可信的证明他有带领别人的能力。


    Simply put, if you cannot lead yourself through discipline and guided by God’s Word, you are not prepared to lead others. It is not a case of “do what I say” but of “do as I do.” Others learn from our personal and positive example.

    简言之，如果你不能严于律己，让神的话带领自己，你就没有预备好去带领别人。这不是“照我所说的去做”之类而是要“学我的样式去做”众人从我们亲力亲为的榜样中学习。

7.    True leadership must be for the benefit of followers, not the enrichment of the leaders.

    真正的引领必定是为着跟随者的益处而非引领者的功名。


    Like Jesus, who is the perfect model of leadership, we are to be “others” oriented. True leadership is never for personal gain but for the benefit and growth of others. Thus, as Christians, we are talking about servant leadership, like Jesus. Be like Jesus! is a good motto for us to follow.

    就想主耶稣，我们完美的领袖榜样一样，我们是“他人”导向的。真正的领袖从不为自己获取而是要为他人的成长得益。因此，作为基督徒我们在分享耶稣式的仆人领袖。学像耶稣！是我们遵循的好格言。

8.    A ship in a harbor is safe but that is not what ships were built for.

    船泊港湾实为安全，却不合造船时的初衷。（船生命的意义在于远航）

    Our personal safety is “in Christ.” Our purpose in life to “go” and share the Gospel with the world. Will we encounter storms in doing His work? Yes! But He promises to bring us safely through the storms into the harbor of Heaven. There we can rest at peace forever!

    我们个人的安全都“在基督里”，我们生命的使命是“去”和传福音给万名。我们在做主工的时候会遇见风浪吗？会的！但祂应许会把我们安全的经过风浪到达天家的港湾。在那里我们将永远安息在平安里。

9.    Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.

    失败是（更加有智慧地）重新开始的良机。


    Failure is to be expected in this sinful world. But our “failures” (sins) are all forgiven in Christ and so we can “start over” every day and hour of our lives. Learn from your mistakes and go forward in Christ. Never, never give up! Keep on keeping on in Jesus!

    我们可以预见在这个有罪的世界上会有失败，但我们的“失败”（罪）在基督里已被赦免，因此我们每时每刻都能够重新再来。从你的错误中学习并在基督里继续前行。绝不放弃，坚持在基督里。

10.    The boss says “go” - the leader says “let’s go.”

    上司说：“去。”　领袖说：“我们去。”


    A boss may give orders. He makes commands and demands of his workers. A leader, on the other hand, encourages (“let’s go”) by participating and working along side of his people. “We’re all in this together” is the motto of the leader and the Christian. The leader is not above or greater than his followers. He is one in Christ with them.

    上司常给我们指令。他为工人们订下要求和规条。一个领袖，却不是这样，他以亲身参与和一同工作来激励（“我们去”）团队。“我们同在这里”是领袖和基督徒的格言。领袖不是高于跟从者或更伟大。他是与众人同在基督里的一员。

11.    Example is not the main thing in influencing others - it’s the only thing.

    感化/影响他人，榜样是唯一的。（榜样的力量是无穷的）

    Model what you want done. Show by example and encourage with words. Example influences people more than just words. Who have been some good models/examples in your life? Thank them and follow in their footsteps.

    以身作则、言传身教。榜样比话语更能影响人。谁是你生命中的榜样或模范呢？感谢他们并追随他们的脚步吧。

12.    The first step to leadership is servanthood.

    引导与带领的首要步骤是服事。

    Christian leadership begins and ends with service. Being a servant leader is the greatest and highest compliment someone could make of you. Be like Jesus who, being God, became a man to serve and to save us. “The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give His life as the ransom for the many.” Mark 10:45 Leaderships is not “getting” but “giving,” not “being served” but “serving.”

    基督徒领袖始终围绕着服事。活出仆人式的领导是别人能给你的最好、最高的称赞。学象耶稣，本有上帝的形象，成为人的样式来服事，且在服事我们。“人子来不是要人服事乃是要服事人，并且要舍命做多人的赎价”马可福音10:45领袖不是要“得到”而是要“给予”不是要“被服事”而是要“去服事”。

13.    One person with passion is more influential than ninety-nine people who have only a passing interest.

    一个满腔热忱的人胜过九十九个只怀有三分钟热情/兴趣的人。


    “Passion” means giving your heart and soul to a calling or task. It means having “compassion” for the lost souls of the world. Again, it is being like Jesus. The word “Christian” actually means a “little Christ.” Be a “little Christ” in the world! See Matthew 9:36 and Colossians 3:12-14.

    “激情”的意思是全身心的把自己投入到呼召或任务中去。它意味着“关切”世界上失落的灵魂。同样的，就应象耶稣一样。“基督徒”这个词的实际意义就是一个“小基督”，在世界上做一个小耶稣吧。请参考马太福音9:36和歌罗西书3:12-14。

14.    Leadership is like being a lady. If you have to tell someone you are, you aren’t!

    引领之道恰似淑女之道——如果你必须告诉别人你是什么，你不是什么。


    This is a humorous quote which simply says: “If you have to tell people again and again that you are the leader, you are probably not the leader.” You show you are a leader not by words but by actions!

    这是一则幽默的引言，意思是：“如果你的不断的告诉别人你是领导,你很可能就不是。”表现出你领导身份的是行为而不是话语。

15.    Leadership is influence, nothing more and nothing less.

    引领之道只在于感化/影响他人。

    This is a “worldly” definition for leadership. Obviously, you could “influence” people for better or for worse. Influencing others for Christ is true Christian leadership. A Christian leader says with John the Baptist: “He must become greater. I must become less.” John 3:30

    这是一则“世人”的定义。很明显，你能够影响他人或象好或象坏。引领人归降耶稣是真正的基督徒领袖。基督徒领袖会和实习约翰一同见证：“祂必兴旺、我必衰微”约翰福音3:30

16.    On the human level, everything rises and falls on leadership.

    世间万事，成败在于引领之道。

    This is a “worldly” statement but it is also true. Without leadership very little if anything can or will be accomplished. Good leadership inspires others to serve. Bad leadership discourages others from being involved.

    这是“世人”的观点但也同样正确。如果没有带领的话任何事都或难完成。好的领袖影响他人去服事。不好的领袖阻碍他人参与服事。

17.    Leadership is influence that is brought into captivity to the cross of Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit through the Word, and exercised to the glory of God and the service of others.

    引领之道具有影响感化人的权能，它降服在基督的十字架前，由圣灵通过神的话语授权，被应用于神的荣耀与服事人的事工中。

    This is my personal definition for Christian leadership. It is a little long but it includes three essential elements of Christian leadership.

    1) “brought into captivity to the cross of Christ” implies humility that is focused on the cross of Christ and all that it means for our life in time and eternity;

    2) “empowered by the Holy Spirit through the Word” reminds us that our power to serve comes to us from the Holy Spirit who works in our hearts and lives through His inspired Word, the Word of God; and

    3) is “exercised to the glory of God and the service of others” means that everything we do we want to do to give glory and praise to God (see I Corinthians 10:31) and to serve other people so that they may share in the joy of knowing Jesus as Savior and Lord.

    这是我个人对基督徒领袖的定义。它有点长但囊括了三项基督徒领袖的基本要素。

    1）“降服在基督的十字架前”所包含的谦卑含义在于：只看十字架上的基督和它对我们现时和永恒中的意义；

    2）“由圣灵通过神的话语授权”提醒我们服事的力量源自于在我们心中工作的圣灵，长存于神所启示的话语，就是神的道。

    3）是“被应用于神的荣耀与服事人的事工中”意义是说我们或想或做的事都是要归荣耀给神并且赞美祂（参考哥林多前书10:13）以及服事别人使其能分享到认识耶稣作为救主上帝的喜乐。

“To this end I labor, struggling with all HIS (Christ) energy, which so powerfully works in me.” Col. 1:29

“我也为此劳苦，照他在我里面运用的大能，尽心竭力。”（歌罗西书 1:29）

Sometimes and, sadly perhaps, too often we do our work with “our” energy and we wear out and become frustrated and give up. But when we labor with “His energy,” as this passage urges, we will have His power to get His job done. The Gospel is “the power of God” that saves us and it is also the power of God that enables us to do His will joyfully.

我们有时，而且可能更糟的是常常用我们自己的力量去完成工作，这就让我们耗尽了自己而变得挫败甚至放弃。但若我们用神的大能服事劳苦，就好像这节经文所劝勉的，我们就会得到神的能力来完成神的工作。福音是曾救赎我们的“神的大能”同样也是使我们能够喜乐的行祂旨意的大能。

“I CAN DO everything through him (Christ) who gives me strength.” (Philippians 4:13) Be a CAN DO leader through Christ!

“我靠着那加给我力量的，凡事都能做。”（腓利比书 4:13）靠着基督，做一个无所不能的领袖！

Someone has said, “God and I are a majority.” With God’s authority behind us, with Jesus and our side and with the Holy Spirit going before us to prepare the way, we CAN DO everything that He has called us to do. Lord, Thy Will be done in our lives daily! Amen.
有人说过，“上帝和我占有多数票。”有上帝的能力支持我们，有耶稣在我们一边还有圣灵走在我们前面预备道路。我们就能去做任何神叫我们做的事。主啊，愿袮的旨意每日成就在我们的生活中！阿们。
