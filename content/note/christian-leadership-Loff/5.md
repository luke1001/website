When we think of the Great Commission we almost automatically think of the words of Jesus recorded in Matthew 28, and in particular, the words “go and make disciples.” The fact of the matter is that the same basic truth is recorded five times in five different places…in Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts. And each reference looks at the Great Commission from a different perspective. I refer to these five different angles as THE FIVE M’s.

当我们思想“崇高的使命”时，我们会自然的想到耶酥在马太福音28章中的话语，尤其是“使万民作我的门徒”。事实上，同样的真道在五处不同的地方有过五次记录……在马太福音，马可福音，路加福音，约翰福音和使徒行传。每一处都从不同的角度提及到“崇高的使命”。我将谈到这五个“M”要素的五个不同的角度。



A、The first M is that of MISSION, the mission of the church and of each individual Christian. Matthew 28:19 clearly states what that mission is, to “make disciples of all nations…” It is also important to note that as we undertake that mission, our Lord stands behind us and backs us up with his authority and power (v. 18). We can go about this mission boldly and confidently because the King of kings and Lord of lords is the one who commissions us. Furthermore He is with us (v. 20) in all that we do in His Name!

第一个“M”是“使命”，是每个教会和每位基督徒的使命。（马太福音28:19）明确的阐述了这个使命就是“使万民作我的门徒”。很重要的一点，当我们接受这项使命，我们的主就站在我们的身后并用他的权柄和大能支持我们（马太福音28:18）。我们尽可以大胆自信的去着手这项使命，因为王中之王、万神之神授予我们这项使命。并且，只要我们所做的一切都是奉神的名，神就与我们同在（马太福音28:20）。

To “make disciples of all nations” simply means that we are to bring people into a saving relationship with Jesus. Having said that, we will all quickly say, “Yeah, but that is something that we cannot do!” True! That leads to the second M of the Great Commission passages, recorded in Mark 16:15. There Jesus says: “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.”

“使万民作我的门徒”意思是我们带领人们认识耶酥。说到这，我们很快会说“是啊，但是这也是我们不能做到的！”正确！这就带我们来看到“崇高的使命”中的第二个“M”要素，记录在马可福音16:15中。在这里，耶酥说“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听。”

B、The second M simply reminds us of the MEANS by which disciples are made, by the proclaiming of the Good News, the Gospel, the truths about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus for the world. The Gospel, in Word and Sacrament, is the MEANS OF GRACE. The Gospel is the MEANS by which the Holy Spirit turns a heart of rebellion and unbelief into a heart of faith and trust in Jesus. The Apostle Paul states it so emphatically in Romans 1:16 when he says, “I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes..” The Gospel is the dynamis (the Greek word translated “power”), the dynamite that is able to blast a soul all the way from hell to Heaven. That’s power! That’s the MEANS we are to proclaim to people.

第二个“M”要素提醒我们让人作使徒的“意义”，就是传福音、生与死的真理、耶酥为全世界而复活。这“福音”，在圣经和圣礼中，就是“恩典”的意思。福音的意义在于，通过圣灵把悖逆和不信的心，变成信实和仰赖耶酥的心。圣徒保罗在罗马书1:16强调，当他说“我不以福音为耻；这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的……”这福音就是dynamis（希腊语“大能”的意思），这力量能使灵魂从地狱到天堂。这就是大能！这就是我们要向世人宣告的“意义”！

C、The third M is found in Luke 24:45-48 where the inspired writer presents to us the full MESSAGE we share with people to whom we witness. Jesus says, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” The expression “repentance and forgiveness” encompasses the proclaiming of both Law and Gospel. The Law is shared to expose and convict and condemn of sin and thus to expose the lost and hopeless condition of mankind. The Gospel is then proclaimed to tell of the full and free and eternal forgiveness bought and paid for by Jesus. The Law cannot and does not save. It only convicts of sin. The Gospel converts and saves. Both Law and Gospel are to be proclaimed in the process of “making disciples of all nations.”

第三个“M”要素在路加福音24:45-48，这位受神启示的作者向我们呈现了完整的“信息”，我们要与世人分享、为他们作见证。耶酥说：“照经上所写的，基督必受害，第三日从死里复活，并且人要奉他的名传悔改、赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。”这里的“悔改和赦罪”包含了律法和福音。律法是揭示并宣告对罪恶的惩罚，并揭示人类迷失、无望的状态。福音是告诉我们完全的、自由的和永恒的赦免是由耶酥替我们偿还的。在“使万民作我的门徒”的过程中，我们要同时宣告律法和福音。

D、The fourth M stands for MESSENGER and answers the “who” question of the Great Commission. Who is to do the work of proclaiming Law and Gospel? In John 20:21, after greeting the disciples, Jesus says, “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” Jesus came to do and He now directs His followers to tell! As messengers we are simply to tell what God has done in Christ, of a mission completed and a salvation won! Paul expresses our role as messengers of the Gospel in this way in II Corinthians 5:20: “We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.”

第四个“M”要素是“传道人”，并且回答了“崇高的使命”中“谁去做”的问题。谁来完成宣告律法和福音的工作呢？在约翰福音20:21，在约见使徒之后，耶酥说：“父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。”耶酥这样做了，并且他也指引他的跟随着去做！作为“传道人”，我们只要告诉别人上帝通过耶酥所做的事情，就是完成使命、并且赢得救赎！保罗在哥林多后书5:20表达了“传道人”的角色：“我们作基督的使者，就好像神藉我们劝你们一般。”

E、What a tremendous privilege! What an awesome task! Where do we begin with such a world-wide mission? That brings us to the fifth M of the Great Commission passages, the METHOD, the “how” of proclaiming the Good News, recorded in Acts 1:8. In words of assurance and direction just before His ascension Jesus says: “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth (emphasis mine).”

这是多么大的特权啊！一项令人敬畏的任务！我们应该如何着手这项全球使命呢？让我们看到第五个“M”要素――“方法”。如何传福音，记录在使徒行传1:8。在耶酥升天之前，他说“但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得著能力；并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地和撒马利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。”

What Jesus simply said to the first disciples and what He is saying to us today is: “Start where you are.” The Disciples were in Jerusalem. That was their starting point. Your and my starting point is where we live and work and play and go to school! There is an old saying that states: “The light that shines the farthest shines the brightest at its source.” When the light of Christ and His love shines brightly in our lives through our words and actions, it will find its way through us and through others to the ends of the world!
耶酥对他的使徒所说的、和他对今天的我们说的就是：“从现在的你开始”。使徒在耶路撒冷。那就是他们的起点。你们和我的起点就是我们的生活、工作、娱乐和学习！有一句古话说：“照耀到最远处的光一定最亮。”当基督的光芒和他的大爱通过我们的言和行照耀着我们的生命，它就会沿着我们、沿着其他的人，直到地极。

The FIVE M’s of the Great Commission passages are: MISSION, MEANS, MESSAGE, MESSENGER AND METHOD. Review them often! Remember what our Lord wants us to be doing until He returns again in glory! And realize that our Lord has provided us with everything that we need to do what He calls us to do! “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations!.”
“崇高使命”中的这五个“M”元素就是：使命、意义、福音、传道人、方法。时常温习它们！记住我们的主想要我们做的，直到他再次荣耀地归来！并且意识到我们的主赐给我们一切所需，去做他呼招我们做的事！“使万民作我的门徒！
