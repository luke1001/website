第十章：尊贵的基督：启示录 （Chapter 10）
Chapter 10：The Majestic Christ： Revelation
第十章：尊贵的基督：启示录
Introduction
引言
Revelation is different from the other books in the Bible. It is filled with symbols and pictures. However, its meaning agrees with the rest of Scripture. John wrote down “The revelation of Jesus Christ . . . to show his servants what must take place” (1:1). While the Gospels clearly tell about Jesus life on earth, Revelation tells about Jesus’ role as divine ruler. He is the all-powerful, all-knowing ruler of the universe and, in particular, his Church.
启示录与圣经中的其他书不同。这部书中充满了各种象征和图像。但是，他所表现的涵义与圣经中其他部分内容是一致的。约翰写道：“耶稣基督的启示…叫他将必要快成的事指示他的众仆人”（1:1）。福音书明确地告诉我们了耶稣在世上的生活，而启示录告诉我们的是耶稣作为神圣君王的职责。他是无所不能，无所不知的天地的君王，特别是他教会的君王。

The Writer
作者
The last book of the Bible is known as Revelation. It was written by John, a servant of Jesus Christ (1:1), a man familiar with the seven churches in Asia Minor (1:4, 9), a pious, blessed Christian (22:8).
圣经中最后一部书就是我们说的启示录。它是耶稣基督的一位仆人（1:1），一个熟悉小亚西亚的七个教会的人（1,4,9），一个虔诚的，被祝福的基督徒（22:8）约翰所写。
John was a son of Zebedee, and a first cousin to Jesus. During the crucifixion Jesus asked John to take care of Mary, which he did from that time on. Perhaps it was after Mary died that John moved from Jerusalem to Ephesus. By approximately A.D. 96, when he wrote Revelation, John was well-known and dearly loved by the Christians in the churches of Asia Minor.
约翰是西庇太的儿子，耶稣的第一个表兄弟。耶稣被钉在十字架上的时候要求约翰照顾马利亚，约翰就是从那时起就开始照顾马利亚的。可能是在马利亚去世后约翰才从耶路撒冷搬到以弗所去的。大概是在公元96年，当约翰写启示录的时候，在小亚西亚教会中的基督徒们就已经熟知和深深爱戴他了。
John’s Purpose in Writing
约翰的写作目的
After studying the mysteries in Revelation, Luther said, “My spirit cannot adjust itself to the book.” Many serious students of the Bible have felt the same way. Revelation is unlike any other New Testament book. However, look closely and see that it is very similar to some Old Testament writings. John quotes from or refers to Old Testament passages some 245 times in Revelation. The history and prophetic visions of Revelation are similar to those of the Book of Daniel. Daniel and his fellow Israelites were captured by Nebuchadnezzar and taken to Babylon. There, for the most part, they were allowed to worship their own God as long as they also worshiped the gods of the king (Dan. 3). In time, however, the king asked for all the honor and glory. Anyone who refused to confess that the king was god would be tortured and killed (Dan. 6). The book of Daniel with its prophetic visions is a book of comfort. It looks forward to the coming of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose kingdom would replace the kingdoms of man.
在研究了启示录中的神秘事之后，路德说，“我的灵无法理解这部书”。许多严谨地学习圣经的人有同样的想法。启示录不像新约中的其他书。但是，仔细看会发现它和旧约中一些书很相似。在启示录中有245处是约翰从旧约中引用或参考的章句。启示录中描写的历史和预言性异象与但以理书中的描写的很相似。但以理和其他以色列人被尼布甲尼撒俘虏并带到巴比伦。在那里，大部分时间他们被允许敬拜他们自己的神只要他们也敬拜那里的王所信的一些神（但以理书3）。但是，后来王却要求完全忠于和荣耀他。任何拒绝承认王是神的人都会被折磨和杀死（但以理书6）。带有预言性异象的但以理书是一部安慰人的书。它期待弥赛亚主耶稣基督的降临，他的国将取代人的国。
During John’s life (600 years after Daniel) much of the world was ruled by the emperors of Rome. During the reign of Domitian (A.D. 81 to 96) Christians were told to worship the emperor. But the Christians recognized Jesus, not Caesar, as Lord and God. They refused to worship the emperor. So they were persecuted (see 1:9; 2:13; 6:9-10).
在约翰生活的时期（但以理之后600年）世界的许多地方都是被罗马帝国所统治。在图密善统治时期（公元81年-96年），基督徒被告知要敬拜皇帝。但是基督徒知道耶稣是主和神，而凯撒不是。他们拒绝敬拜皇帝。因此他们被迫害（参考1;9;2:13;6:9-10）。
During these years the Christians began asking themselves some important questions. The faith of the Christians was being tested, but where was Jesus now? What had happened to the believers who had died or been put to death? What would happen to the Church in the future? The visions of John answered these questions. Jesus, who suffered and died during his first coming to earth, will come again. He will destroy all his enemies and set up his kingdom of everlasting glory. God, not man, is in control of history. A glorious future is promised for every believer just like the believers in heaven have wonderful happiness. By keeping this in mind, God’s people on earth can make it through all their trials and sufferings.
在这些年里，基督徒开始问他们自己一些重要的问题。基督徒的信心被试炼，但是此时耶稣在哪里？那些已经去世或被处死的基督徒会怎么样？将来在教会中会发生什么？约翰福音里描述的异象回答了这些问题。在第一次来到世上时受难和为众人死的耶稣将再次降临。他会毁灭他所有的敌人并建立永恒荣耀的国。就像神应许信徒们在天堂中会有美好的幸福一样，神也应许每一位信徒充满荣光的未来。了解了这一点，神在世上的子民可以通过试探和苦难。

Summary
概要
Theme: “I Am Coming Soon”
主题：“我必快来”
The theme of Revelation is a comforting promise of Jesus, “I am coming soon.” Christians answer, “Amen, Come, Lord Jesus” (Rev. 22:20). The Second Coming of Christ will put an end to the evil on earth and to Satan. It will change the suffering church into the victorious church.
启示录的主题是耶稣给我们带来安慰的应许，“我必快来”。基督徒的回答是，“阿们！主耶稣啊，我愿你来”（22:20）。基督的第二次到来将是世上的恶和撒旦的终结。它将把受难的教会变成得胜的教会。
1. Introduction (1:1-8)
引言（1:1-8）
John tells his readers that the revelation he will give in this book is not something he made up. It is from God himself, and is about Jesus Christ. The Christian who reads or hears the words which follow will be blessed.
约翰告诉他的读者他在这本书中将给出的启示不是他所编造的。它是来自于神，并且是关于耶稣基督的。读到和听到这些话的基督徒接下来将会被祝福。
2. “Write . . . What is Now”(1:9-3:22)
“写…现在的事”（1:9-3:22）
John, who had been sent into exile on the island of Patmos, (1:9) saw a series of visions. The first vision was of a man [Christ] in the middle of 7 gold candlesticks [a picture of the 7 churches in Asia Minor]. John was told to write “what is now” (1:19), that is, about the condition of the churches in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The “angel of the church” [pastor] should be aware of the spiritual health or sickness of the church. And he should know what action the almighty Christ is thinking of taking. Because Jesus is coming back soon, actions to solve the spiritual problems need to be taken soon as well.
约翰，曾被驱逐到一个叫拔摩的海岛（1:9），看到过一系列的异象。第一个异象是一个人【基督】在七个金灯台中间【描写的是在小亚西亚的七个教会】。约翰被告知要写“现在的事”（1:19），就是写关于以弗所、士每拿、别迦摩、推雅推喇、撒狄、非拉铁非和老底嘉教会的情况。“教会的使者”【牧师】应该注意教会属灵的健康或病。并且他应该知道怎样的行为是全能的基督所接受的。因为耶稣不久将降临，解决属灵问题的行为也需要尽快被教会采纳。
While John’s vision was written to 7 churches, the lessons of these letters are for all churches until the day of Christ’s coming. These churches can be described as follows:
虽然约翰的异象是写给这七个教会的，但是这些信中的教导是给所有教会的直到基督降临的那一天。这些教会被描述成：
1. Ephesus: The Declining Church (2:1-7)
以弗所: 衰退的教会(2:1-7)
2. Smyrna: The Martyr Church
士每拿: 殉道的教会(2:8-11)
3. Pergamum: The Mixed Church (2:12-17)
别迦摩: 混合的教会 (2:12-17)
4. Thyatira: The Adulterous Church (2:18-29)
推雅推喇: 行淫的教会 (2:18-29)
5. Sardis: The Dead Church (3:1-6)
撒狄: 死的教会 (3:1-6)
6.P hiladelphia: The Faithful Mission Church (3:7-13)
非拉铁非: 信实的传道教会(3:7-13)
7. Laodicea The Lukewarm Indifferent Church (3:14-22)
老底嘉: 不冷不热漠不关心的教会(3:14-22)
3. “Write . . . What will take Place Later”(4:1-22:6)
“写…将来必成的事”（4:1-22:6）
One must be careful not to think too much about the different symbols and numbers in this part. Think instead about the great truths which are shown. These truths are:
有一点要注意的是不要对这一部分里不同的象征和符号思考太多。只要思考其中展现的重要真理。这些真理是：
1. God, not man, is in control of history.
神，不是人，掌握着历史。
2. There is a life and death fight between the rulers of earth and Christians. There is even a deeper fight between Satan and God.
在世上的统治者和基督徒之间有生和死的争斗。更深的争斗是撒旦和神之间的。
3. Believers should stay away from sin and remain faithful.
信徒应该远离罪并保持信心。
4. In the end, faith will win over the power of men and Satan.
最终，信心会战胜人和撒旦的力量。
5. Nothing can stop God’s judgment; evil will loose.
任何事都不能阻止神的审判；恶魔会失败。
6. A blessed future awaits the believer who remains faithful.
被祝福的未来等待着保持信心的信徒。
The visions in chapters 4-11 tell of the battle between the Church of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, and the evil powers of this world. Terrible things will happen, but Christ will remain in control.
第四至十一章中的异象讲的是羔羊，耶稣基督的教会与世上邪恶力量的争战。可怕的事情即将发生，但是基督会决定一切。
In chapters 4-5 John had a vision in which he saw God on his throne in heaven, surrounded by the 24 Elders [representatives of the Old and New Testament believers] and angels including the four living creatures [Seraphim/Cherubim]. Only the slain and risen Lamb [Jesus] could open the seven seals on the scroll.
第四至五章约翰的异象中他看到神在天堂里坐在宝座上，围绕着他的有24位长老【代表的是旧约和新约的信徒】和天使包括4个活物【撒拉弗/基路伯】。只有被杀并复活的羔羊【耶稣】能够揭开书卷中的七印。
The 4 horsemen of chapter 6 [conquest of Antichrist, war, famine and death, see Matt. 24:5-10] show the pain and struggle of human history. Nevertheless, the Lord knows what takes place and is in charge. At this point the fifth seal is opened and Christian martyrs cry out for justice. The sixth seal shows how Jesus is in control of judgment.
第六章中的四个骑马的人【胜了敌基督者、战争、饥荒和死，参见马太福音24:5-10】揭示了人类历史上的痛苦和争斗。然而，主知道将要发生什么事以及谁将掌权。此时第五个印被揭开并且基督徒殉道者大声喊出要求公正。第六个印显示出耶稣如何在审判中掌权。
Chapter 7 answers the question of 6:17, “For the great day of wrath has come, and who can stand?” God’s elect, the believers purified by Christ’s blood, will stand unafraid before God.
第七章回答了第六章十七节的问题，“因为他们忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？”神的拣选，被基督宝血洗净的基督徒将无所畏惧地站立在神面前。
In chapter 8 the opening of the seventh seal begins the vision of seven trumpets (8:1-11:19). These visions give a look at the church from John’s day until the end of time. God’s terrible trumpet blasts are a serious warning calling men to repent before it is too late. The believers are told to remain strong , for the conditions on earth, as seen in chapter nine, will not get any better.
第八章中第七印的揭开展开了七支号的异象（8:1-11:19）。这些异象让我们看到了从约翰时代起到世界末了的教会。神令人恐惧的号角的吹响是要众人在还来得及的时候悔改的严厉警告。信徒被告知要保持刚强，因为如第九章中我们所看到的，世上的情况不会再有好的转变。
Between the sixth and seventh trumpet blasts (chapters 10-11), as between the sixth and seventh seals, there is a small break. The question to be asked is: when will the Lord come? The answer is “soon” or “there will be no more delay”(10:6)! Before then, the sweet Gospel still will be preached and this will bring strong persecution (10:9-11). Meanwhile the church must not become a place that allows hypocrites, for the false church will not succeed (11:1-2). The church must proclaim repentance as did Elijah and Moses.
在吹响第六支和第七支号之间（10-11章），正如第六印和第七印被揭开之间一样，有短暂的间歇。人们提出了这样的问题：什么时候主会到来？答案是“快要”或“不再有时日了”（10:6）！在那日之前，甜蜜的福音仍会被传讲并带来大逼迫（10:9-11）。同时，教会不应该允许假冒为善的人留在那里，因为假的教会不会成功 （11:1-2）。教会应该像以利亚和摩西一样宣告悔改。
Beginning at chapter 12 the message of Revelation changes from the fight between the church of Christ and the evil powers of earth to the fight between the Lord Jesus and the powers of darkness. Chapter 12 begins a new vision. A woman [the church, ancestors of Christ] has a son [Jesus Christ] whom the dragon [Satan] tries without success to destroy. The devil does attack the people of God.
第十二章的一开始启示录的信息由基督教会与世上邪恶力量的争斗转变为主耶稣与黑暗力量的争斗。第十二章展现了一个新的异象。一个妇人【教会，基督的先辈】生了一个儿子【耶稣基督】，大龙【撒旦】试图毁灭他但没有成功。魔鬼攻击神的子民。
The beasts of chapter 13 are two pictures of Antichrist who demand worship (as did Domitian) and pretends to be an instrument of the church. This false christ fights a war against the church (13:7). Faithful believers must stand strong during this persecution (13:10).Like the two previous breaks, chapter 14 helps the faithful who wonder whether Christians can stand up under this persecution and when Christ will come. God tells the church that it will not be destroyed, but that God will judge the beast.
第十三中的怪兽是要求敬拜（如Domitian所做的）并伪装成教会结构的敌基督者的两个异象。这个假基督与教会争战（13:7）。有信心的信徒一定要在这个迫害中站立得稳（13:10）。如之前的两个间歇一样，第十四章帮助了那些有信心但是疑惑基督徒能否在逼迫下和基督到来的时候站立得稳的人。神告诉教会怪兽会被毁灭，但是会由神来审判它。
Chapters 15-16 contain the visions of the seven bowls. As Satan continues to corrupt mankind, Jesus gives his final judgments before his Second Coming.
第十五至十六章包括了七个碗的异象。因为撒旦不断使人跌倒，耶稣在他第二次到来之前进行最后的审判。
Finally, after so much suffering at the hands of such great evil, John and the believers are given a picture of the final destruction of Satan and his anti-Christian forces (chapters 17-20). In the middle of this the voices of the godly are heard praising the Lord for his justice and judgments (19:1-8).
最终，在如此大罪恶之下受到这样的苦难以后，约翰和信徒被给予撒旦和他敌基督力量最终毁灭的异象（17-20章）。在这一部分中间听到了圣洁的声音赞美主的公义和审判（19:1-8）。
With the battle over and the victory won by Christ, the believers are given a view of heaven (21:1-22:6). In the first book of the Bible, Genesis, God’s perfect creation is described. But sin entered into the world and put an end to Eden. The curse of sin had a deep effect. Now, at long last, the curse is ended and the eternal life that was lost is again open to God’s people. Note the similarities in the table below.
随着争斗的结束和基督的胜利，信徒们看到天堂的景象（21:1-22:6）。在圣经的第一部书，创世纪中，描述了神的完美创造。但是罪进入世界并使得伊甸园不再存在。对罪的咒诅有很深的影响。此时，终于，咒诅结束了并且丢失的永生再次迎接神的子民。注意下表中的相似点。

4. Conclusion (22:7-21)
结论（22:7-21）
At last John comes back to earth from his heavenly vision. The central truths he preaches are simple – “Worship God”(22:9) for “the time [of Christ’s coming] is near”(22:10). God will protect his people in the middle of the problems and persecutions of life, for “the grace of the Lord Jesus [will] be with God’s people” (22:21).
最后约翰从他的天上的异象中回到世上。他传讲的真理的中心是——“你要敬拜神”（22:9）因为“日期【基督的到来】近了”（22:10）。神会在生活的困难和迫害中保护他的子民，因为“主的恩惠【将】常与众圣徒同在”（22:21）。
