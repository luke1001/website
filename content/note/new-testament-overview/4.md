Chapter 3：Growth of the Living Church: Acts & Romans
第三章：活教会的发展: 使徒行传 和 罗马书
Introduction
引言
Luke’s history of the early Church (Acts) shows how the Holy Spirit used the Gospel message to help the Church grow and spread. Much of Acts tells of the work of the missionaries Peter and Paul because they boldly preached the crucified and risen Jesus to be the Lord and Savior. Acts describes the growth of the Christian Church around the coast of the eastern half of the Mediterranean Sea, from Jerusalem to Rome. Paul’s letter to the Romans tells of Paul’s plans for carrying the Gospel message all the way to Spain. Paul hoped that the Italian believers were as strong as the Christians in Syrian Antioch. Then he could use them to help spread the Gospel to the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.
路加写的早期教会的历史（使徒行传）向我们展现了圣灵如何用福音帮助教会成长和壮大。 使徒行传主要讲的是彼得和保罗的传道工作，因为他们大胆地传讲被钉十字架并升天的耶稣是主也是我们的救主。使徒行传描写了地中海东海岸，从耶路撒冷到罗马的基督教会的成长。保罗写给罗马人的书信告诉我们了保罗计划将福音一直带到西班牙。保罗希望意大利的信徒们能像叙利亚安提阿的基督徒一样坚定。这样他就能通过他们的帮助将福音传到地中海的西海岸。

The Writer
作者
Many things in the book itself show that it was written by Luke. First of all, this work is written to continue the story of Luke’s Gospel (compare Luke 1:1-4 with Acts 1:1-2). Second, most histories describe what happened to other people. The sentences begin with the words “he” or “they.” But some parts of Acts say “we”(16:10-17; 20:5-21:18; 27:1-28:16). This can only mean that the writer Luke was present during these times. Third, Luke was known as the beloved doctor (Col. 4:14). The writer of Acts uses exact medical descriptions just as he does in his Gospel.
书中的许多事情本身显示了这部书是路加写的。首先，这部书中所写的事情是路加福音的延续（比较路加福音1:1-4和使徒行传1:1-2）。第二，大部分历史描述了发生在别人身上的事情。一些句子以“他”或者“他们”开始。但是使徒行传中的一些章节说到“我们”（16:10-17；20:5-21:18；27:1-28:16）。这只能说明作者路加在那时和他们在一起。第三，路加被称为“受人喜爱的医生”（歌罗西书4:14）。使徒行传的作者使用的精确的医学定义正如他在福音书里写的一样。
Luke’s Purpose in Writing
路加的写作目的
Acts continues the story of the church where Luke’s Gospel left off. It begins with Jesus’ return to heaven. At the beginning of his Gospel Luke gives his reason for writing his two books of history. He tells a believer named Theophilus that other people, even eyewitnesses, had already written down Jesus’ words and deeds. But, he says, after much research he had decided to write the events of Jesus’ life yet again so that Theophilus could be certain about what Jesus did and said (Luke 1:1-4).
使徒行传延续路加福音所中断的关于教会事情的记述。从耶稣返回天堂开始。在福音书的开始，路加给出了他写这两部有关历史的书的原因。他告诉一个名叫提阿非罗的信徒，其他人甚至见证人们，都已经将耶稣的言语和行为记录下来了。但是他说，在做了很多研究之后，他决定再次写关于耶稣生平的事件以便使提阿非罗确信耶稣的言语和行为（路加福音 1:1-4）。
Luke searched out the complete story of Jesus’ to make the faith of Theophilus stronger (Luke’s Gospel). He then wrote the Acts of the Apostles to show how the Holy Spirit spread the Christian message from Jerusalem to Rome. Thousands of men, women, and children became believers through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
路加为了使提阿非罗的信心更加坚定，他找到了有关耶稣的完整事件（路加福音）。然后他写了使徒行传来展现圣灵如何将基督徒的信息从耶路撒冷传到罗马。数千名男人，女人和儿童通过耶稣基督的福音成为信徒。

Summary
概述
Theme: “You will be My Witnesses”
主题:“你们要作我的见证”
Shortly before going back to heaven Jesus told his disciples, “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth”(1:8). This is a summary of the book of Acts.
在回到天堂之前的短暂时间里，耶稣告诉他的门徒们，“但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力；并要在耶路撒冷，犹太全地和撒玛利亚，知道地极，作我的见证”（1:8）。这是使徒行传的概述。
The Holy Spirit, named 70 times in Acts, created faith in the hearts of thousands of Jews and Gentiles. The means by which he produced such changes were the Gospel message and Baptism. The latter is mentioned 18 times in Acts while numerous Christ-centered sermons are recorded in detail.
圣灵，在使徒行传中被提到了70次，在数千名犹太人和外邦人心里建立了信心。创造这些变化的方式是福音和洗礼。在详细记录许多以基督为中心的讲道时，后者在使徒行传中被提到了18次。
1. Introduction (1:1-11)
引言（1:1-11）
The first verses of Acts connect Luke’s Gospel to his history of how the Word of God spread. It tells Jesus’ instructions to the disciples and then his going back into heaven.
使徒行传的第一节将路加福音和神的话语如何得到传播的历史联系在一起。它将耶稣的指示告诉门徒们并告诉他们耶稣已经回到天堂。
2. Witnesses in Jerusalem (1:12-7:60)
在耶路撒冷的见证 （1:12-7:60）
The first 7 chapters of Acts describe the spread of Christianity as the Gospel is preached in Jerusalem. Peter and John are the main characters.
使徒行传的前7章描写了福音在被传讲的同时基督教在耶路撒冷的传播。彼得和约翰是主要人物。
The 10 days after Christ went back into heaven were days of preparation. A group of about 120 believers met together and prayed. Then a new disciple was chosen to take the place of Judas Iscariot. Peter, who had been forgiven for denying Christ, again became the spokesman for the Jewish Christians (1:12-26).
在耶稣回到天堂后的10天是预备的时间。有约120名信徒在一起聚会并祷告。然后他们新拣选了一个使徒代替加略人犹大。彼得，已经被赦免他不认基督的罪，再次成为犹太基督徒的代言人（1:12-26）。
Ten days after Jesus’ return to heaven and 50 days after Easter Sunday, the Holy Ghost came down on the believers in the form of tongues of fire. The apostles could suddenly speak in tongues (foreign languages) without having studied them. Now they were ready to begin spreading the Gospel to all mankind.
在耶稣回到天堂后的10天之后并复活节星期天之后的50天，圣灵如火焰的舌头一样显现落在信徒们的头上。使徒们突然间没有通过学习就能说各样方言（别国的话）。现在他们准备开始向各国传播福音。
That Sunday, Jerusalem was filled with Jews and converts from many countries. They had come to celebrate the Jewish festival of Pentecost. When a crowd gathered to see these uneducated Christians speaking in so many languages, Peter used the chance to preach. The Holy Ghost worked through the sermon and 3000 people were baptized (2:1-41).
在那个星期天，耶路撒冷聚集了当地和从各国来的犹太人。他们来庆祝犹太人的节日五旬节。当众人聚集看到这些没有受过教育的基督徒会说这么多国家的语言时，彼得借此机会开始传道。圣灵通过讲道做工，3000人受了洗（2:1-41）。
About 20% of Acts is made up of speeches and sermons given by Christian leaders. The following points are made in most of the sermons:
使徒行传约20%的部分都是基督徒领袖所作的发言和讲道。以下是大多数讲道中的提到的要点:
1. The Old Testament prophecies have been fulfilled. The promised Savior has arrived.
旧约的预言已经被实现。应许的救主已经来到。
2. Jesus is the Messiah. He suffered and died, but rose from the dead, went up into heaven and there will sit in glory as judge.
耶稣是弥赛亚。他受难离世，但是已从死里复活，进入天堂并那里作为审判者坐在荣耀里。
3. Therefore, those who hear this message should repent and believe.
因此，那些听到这个消息的人应该悔改并相信耶稣。
Acts 2:42-47 shows us the life of the early Christian church. “They spent their time studying what the apostles taught and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread [Lord’s Supper] and to prayer.” They shared and showed love to each other, lived godly lives, and witnessed to the love of Christ throughout Jerusalem. Their religion was not a part of their life. It was their life.
使徒行传2:42-47向我们展现了早期基督徒教会的生活。“他们花时间学习使徒的教训，彼此交接、擘饼（圣餐）、祈祷。”他们分享和彼此相爱，过敬虔的生活，并为基督的爱传遍耶路撒冷作见证。他们的信仰不只是他们生活的一部分。而是他们的生活的全部。
The power of the Gospel soon became known to all the people of Jerusalem (3:1 to 4:31). Peter and John called upon the name of Jesus to heal a man crippled from birth. A crowd gathered to see the results of this miracle and Peter, preached a sermon. The Holy Spirit worked through the spoken word and the number of Christians grew to 5000 men plus women and children. Satan, however, did not take this without a fight. The priests who earlier opposed Christ, the captain of the temple security guards, and the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection of the body, had Peter and John arrested.
福音的能力不久就被耶路撒冷所有人所知晓（3:1-4:31）。彼得和约翰奉耶稣的名医治一个自出生时就瘸腿的人。众人看到了这个神迹的结果和彼得的讲道。圣灵通过所讲的话作工使得成为基督徒的男人的数目增加到5000再加上妇女和儿童。尽管撒旦不会不经反对就接受这一切。之前反对耶稣的祭司们，守殿官和撒都该人都否认身体的复活，并将彼得和约翰捉拿起来。
When their trial began Peter preached boldly that Jesus Christ was the cornerstone. This sermon so surprised the Jews that Peter and John were released. However, the Jews threatened them not to preach again. The disciples refused to be silent.
当他们的审判开始后，彼得大胆地传讲耶稣基督是房角石。这次的讲道使犹太人如此的惊奇以至于将彼得和约翰释放了。尽管犹太人还是恐吓了他们不要再进行传道了。门徒们拒绝保持沉默。
Here we have another view of the early church (4:32-5:11). But while most of the church was full of love and sharing, others only pretended. Ananias and Sapphira could not hide their sin from the Holy Spirit.
在此我们从另一面来看看早期的教会（4:32-5:11）。但是当大多数教会被爱和分享充满的时候，其他教会只是假装相信。亚拿尼亚和撒非喇不能向圣灵隐瞒他们的罪。
The Apostles healed in the name of Jesus. These miracles made the disciples popular (5:12-16). Yet this made the Jewish leaders very jealous, and the Apostles were persecuted (5:17-42).
使徒们奉耶稣的名施行医治。这些神迹使得使徒们受到欢迎（5:12-16）。但是这使得犹太领袖们非常忌恨并对使徒们进行迫害（5:17-42）。
The early Christian church in Jerusalem was doing well sharing the Gospel, but it also had problems (6:1-7). The Apostles came to know that they could not manage the growing church by themselves. Thus, while they spent their time on spiritual matters, seven other men were elected to take care of the other work of the church. Two of these men, Stephen and Philip, soon played big roles in the church.
早期耶路撒冷的基督徒教会在分享福音方面做得非常好，但是也存在一些问题（6:1-7）。使徒们意识到凭他们的能力不能管理迅速壮大的教会。因此，当使徒们专心于属灵的事务时，另外拣选的七名弟兄就负责教会的其他事工。其中的两人，司提反和腓力，立即就在教会中起了很重要的作用。
Luke now tells the story of Stephen (6:8-7:60). The Holy Spirit had given power to Stephen, like many of the believers, to do great wonders among the people. This earned for him the hatred of many Jews in a local synagogue. They were so angry that they were willing to bring false charges against Stephen. When given the chance to speak, Stephen recalled the Old Testament, showing that God was a God of the Gentiles as well as the Jews. But the Jews had not welcomed and listened to God’s messengers. The angry Jews took Stephen out and stoned him to death. Thus he became the first Christian martyr. The word ‘martyr’ means ‘a witness.’ Stephen, like the other believers, witnessed in Jerusalem. As a result of his death the faithful would witness throughout the Roman world.
路加在此告诉我们了关于司提反的故事（6:8-7:60）。圣灵给了司提反能力，就像许多的信徒一样，在民间行了大奇事。这让他遭到当地一个会堂中许多犹太人的憎恨。他们非常生气就带人陷害司提反。当司提反得到机会讲论的时候，司提反就重新提及旧约，告诉众人神是犹太人的神也是外邦人的神。但是犹太人不喜欢这些也不听神使者的话。愤怒的犹太人将司提反带出去用石头将他打死。因此他成为了第一个基督徒殉道者。“殉道者”这个词的意思是“见证人”。司提反，就像其他信徒一样，在耶路撒冷作了见证。由于他的死使有信心的人分散在罗马帝国作见证。
3. Witnesses in Judea and Samaria (8:1-12:31)
在犹太和撒玛利亚的见证（8:1-12:31）
The murder of Stephen started a bigger persecution of the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem. Many of the Christians were forced to flee to areas throughout Judea and Samaria. This great evil, however, resulted in a blessing. The Christians took their faith with them wherever they went (8:1-4).
迫害司提反的人开始更大规模地对耶路撒冷的犹太基督徒进行逼迫。许多的基督徒被迫逃到犹太和撒玛利亚地区。这样的大灾祸却成为了一种祝福。基督徒们无论去到哪里都保持着信心（8:1-4）。
Philip, a co-worker with Stephen, is a case in point (8:5-40). Sometimes after Stephen’s death, Philip went to a city in Samaria and preached Jesus as Lord and worked miracles in the name of Jesus. Even a famous magician was converted along with many others. When word of this reached Jerusalem, Peter and John went to visit that city and helped spread the Gospel there.
腓力，和司提反同工的弟兄，就是一个很好的例子（8:5-40）。在司提反死后，腓力有时去撒玛利亚的一个城宣讲主耶稣并奉耶稣的名在那里施行神迹。甚至连一个有名的行邪术的人并许多其他的人都信了神的道。当这个消息传到耶路撒冷，彼得和约翰就去到那座城拜访并帮助使福音在那里兴旺起来。
From Samaria Philip was called by an angel to a desert road in southern Judea. There he met a government official from Ethiopia who was reading a portion of the Old Testament (Is. 53:7-8). When Philip showed the man that this passage referred to Christ, the man believed and was baptized. From there Philip went up the Judean coast preaching all the way to Caesarea.
在撒玛利亚，腓力被主的一个使者呼召去犹太南方的一条通往旷野的路。在那里，他遇到了从埃堤阿伯来的官员正在念旧约中的一段（以赛亚书53:7-8）。当腓力告诉那个人经上所指的是基督时，那个人相信并受洗。从那里腓力前往犹太海岸一路传道直到凯撒利亚。
So far Saul (Paul) has hardly been mentioned (7:58; 8:1, 3). Now, however, Luke tells the story of the conversion of Saul (9:1-19). This event was so important that it is described in detail two more times in Acts (22:3ff and 26:2ff). Indeed the last half of the book shows the results of this conversion.
之前扫罗（保罗）很少被提及（7:58，8:1，3）。然而这里路加告诉我们了扫罗悔改的事情（9:1-19）。这件事非常重要以至于使徒行传中还有两处也对这件事进行了详细的描述（22:3ff 和 26:2ff）。确实这部书的后半部分告诉我们了悔改带来的结果。
Peter was the leading apostle to the Jews. Saul, renamed Paul, was the great missionary to the Gentiles. After his baptism Paul preached in Damascus, spent time in the Arabian Desert, and then returned to Damascus. There he found his life in danger and had to flee the city. He came to Jerusalem and through the help of Barnabas was brought together with the other Christians.
彼得带领使徒们来到犹太人的地方。扫罗改名叫保罗，成为一位出色的到外邦去的传道人。在保罗受洗后，他在大马士革传道，并在阿拉伯地区停留，然后回到大马士革。在那里他发现他自己处境危险而不得不逃离那座城。他来到耶路撒冷并通过巴拿巴的帮助被带去与其他基督徒见面。
Meanwhile Peter was reaching out with the Gospel to the people of Samaria and Judea (9:32-12:25). In Lydda he called upon the name of Jesus to heal a paralyzed man. Many accepted Christ (9:32-37). In Joppa the Lord used Peter to raise a wonderful Christian woman named Dorcas from the dead. Again many people believed in Jesus (9:38-43).
同时彼得向撒玛利亚和犹太地区的人传讲福音（9:32-12:25）。在吕大，他奉耶稣的名医治一个瘫痪的人。许多人就归服了主（9:32-37）。在约帕，主通过彼得使一个常常行善叫多加的妇人从死里复活。这件事又让许多人信了耶稣（9:38-43）。
One day in Caesarea a Roman soldier who believed in Jesus (Cornelius was his name) had a vision. Cornelius obeyed the order of an angel and sent for Peter. Before the messengers arrived, however, Peter saw a vision of his own. When Cornelius and Peter met together the meaning of the visions became clear – “God does not show favoritism but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right”(10:35). In other words, God wants his Word and salvation to bring Gentiles into the church too (10:1-48). Peter explained to the Jewish believers that salvation can only be found in Jesus Christ and not earned by what we do or don’t eat(11:1-18).
有一天，在凯撒利亚一个信了耶稣的罗马士兵（他的名字是哥尼流）看见了异象。哥尼流按照天使的指示打发人去请彼得。在使者到达之前，彼得就已经看到了关于他自己的异象。当哥尼流和彼得见面时就明白的异象的意思是-意神是不偏待人。原来各国中，那敬畏主、行义的人都为主所悦纳”（10:35）。换句话说，神希望他的话语和救恩也能将外邦人带入教会（10:1-48）。彼得向犹太的信徒讲解救恩只能在耶稣基督里找到，而不是通过我们所做的或所吃的东西获得（11:1-18）。
By this time Christianity had spread as far north as Syrian Antioch. Here Barnabas and Saul (Paul) taught for a full year. And it was here that the believers in Christ Jesus were called Christians (11:19-30). As it turns out, it was from Antioch that Paul would go out on his missionary journeys among the Gentiles.
此时基督教已经向北边一直传到叙利亚安提阿。巴拿巴和扫罗（保罗）已经在那里教导了一整年。并且在那里，基督耶稣的信徒们被称为基督徒（11:19-30）。事实证明，从安提阿开始保罗就开始了在外邦人中传道的行程。
The spread of Christianity was threatening the Jews. They started more persecutions. The disciple James was killed (12:1-3). Peter was arrested and put in prison by Herod. However, the Lord rescued him, sending an angel to take him out of prison (12:3-19). Herod, who had caused the death of Christians, also met with the justice of God (12:19-25).
基督教的兴旺让犹太人感到受到威胁。他们开始进行更多的迫害。门徒雅各被杀（12:1-3）。彼得被希律捉拿并关进监牢。但是主救了他；主差遣一个天使将他从监牢里带来出来。（12:3-19）。希律，这个害死了很多基督徒的人，也受到了神的审判（12:19-25）。
4. Witnesses to the Ends of the Earth(13:1-28:31)
直到地极的见证（13:1-28:31）
The last half of Acts shows the Gospel message preached to the Gentiles and finally in Rome itself. Since Paul was the most important missionary to the Gentiles, his work is described most fully.
使徒行传的后半部分向我们展示了福音的信息被传到外邦人那里并最终传到了罗马。由于保罗对于外邦人来说是最重要的传道人，他的事工被描述的最充分。
A. Paul’s First Missionary Journey (13:1-15:35)
保罗的第一次传道旅程（13:1-15:35）
Paul and Barnabas were in Syrian Antioch when God called them to go on a great missionary journey among the Gentiles (13:1-3). With the blessing of their fellow Christians they set sail for Cyprus.
当神召保罗和巴拿巴到外邦人中去进行伟大的传道行程时，他们正在叙利亚的安提阿（13:1-3）。得了跟随的基督徒的祝福，他们乘船去往塞浦路斯。
Up to this time Barnabas had been the head missionary, but on Cyprus Paul stood up against a magician and helped convert a Roman proconsul (13:4-12). From that point on Paul seems to have taken over the leadership.
到此时为止，巴拿巴都是传道人带领者，但是在塞浦路斯保罗却站出来抵挡一个术士并且帮助一个罗马地方总督信了神的道（13:4-12）。从这一点来看，保罗似乎已经开始领导传道行程。
From Cyprus the missionaries traveled to the coast of Asia Minor (today western Turkey). Here John Mark left the missionaries and went home. Crossing the coastal mountains, the Christians walked to a city also known as Antioch (13:13-52). There Paul preached to the Jews first and then to the Gentiles. This was to become his normal method of bringing the message of Christ to Gentiles. But as so often would happen, most of the Jews rejected Jesus, while many of the Gentiles believed.
传道人们从塞浦路斯到小亚西亚沿岸（现今的西土耳其）。在这里，约翰马可离开了传道人回家乡去了。越过沿海的山区，基督徒们去了在安提阿的一个有名的城市（13:13-52）。在那里保罗先向犹太人传道，然后再向外邦人传道。这成为了他常用的一种将基督的信息带给外邦人的方法。但是就像过去常发生的一样，大多数犹太人都拒绝耶稣，然而许多的外邦人却信了。
After a troubling affair in Antioch, the missionaries went to Iconium, then to Lystra and Derbe (14:1-20). In Lystra Paul called upon the Lord to heal a lame man. As a result of this healing miracle the Gentiles tried to honor Paul and Barnabas as gods. The Christian missionaries would not allow this. Also in Lystra the Jews tried to kill Paul with stones and left him for dead. There would be many other stories like this before Paul was finally martyred.
在安提阿发生的一件困扰传道人的事件之后，他们就往以哥念去了，然后去了路司得和特庇（14:1-20）。在路司得保罗呼求主医治一个瘸腿的人。而施行医治的奇迹的结果却是外邦人试图尊保罗和巴拿巴为神。这些基督徒传教士们没有允许这样的事发生。还是在路司得犹太人试图用石头将保罗打死，在以为他死了之后才离开。在保罗最终殉道之前发生在他身上很多类似的事情。
From Derbe the missionaries went back through Lystra, Iconium and Pisidian Antioch and finally arrived home safely in Antioch of Syria (14:21-28). Paul’s first missionary journey had come to an end.
传道人们从特庇经过路司得，以哥念和彼西底的安提阿最终安全返回到在叙利亚的安提阿的家乡（14:21-28）。保罗结束了他的第一次传道行程。
What happened on this first missionary trip soon happened through the whole Christian church. More and more Gentiles were coming into the church. Two questions came up. What is necessary for a person to be saved and to enter the Christian church? Peter, Paul, and Barnabas said this happens by faith in Christ alone. Certain Jewish Christians, however, had a different answer. They said that to become a true Christian a person must first be circumcised and obey the Laws of Moses as well as have faith (15:5). The second question was this: Could Jewish Christians eat together with Gentile Christians.
在第一次传道行程之后，整个基督教会发生了什么事情？越来越多的外邦人来到教会。有两个问题出现了。一个人想要得救和进入基督教会需要做什么？彼得，保罗和巴拿巴说这唯独靠着在基督里的信心。一些犹太的基督徒却又不同的答案。他们说要成为一个真正的基督徒必须先受割礼并遵行摩西的律法并有信心（15:5）。第二个问题是:犹太的基督徒能和外邦的基督徒一起吃喝吗？
At this same time, these same problems were being discussed in the churches which Paul had just started in the province of Galatia. The church in Jerusalem wanted these issues settled for their own peace of mind. Therefore an apostolic council was called in Jerusalem (15:1-35). It was probably just before leaving for the council that Paul wrote a sharp letter to his newly founded churches. We call this letter Galatians. In it Paul answers the questions. In Jerusalem Paul and Barnabas explained how salvation had come to the Gentiles without their obeying the Jewish laws. James, the head of the Jerusalem believers, then decided that Jewish laws should not be forced on the Gentiles. At the same time he demanded that Gentiles should not offend the Jews or sin. They wrote down this decision in a letter.
同时，保罗刚刚在歌罗西兴起的一些教会中也在讨论同样的问题。耶路撒冷的教会为了他们自己安宁想要平息这些争论。因此在耶路撒冷召开了使徒议会（15:1-35）。可能在保罗正要离开前往议会之前，他给他刚建立不久的教会写了一封非常犀利的信。我们称这封信“加拉太书”。在这部书里，保罗回答了一些问题。在耶路撒冷保罗和巴拿巴讲解了救恩如何降临到外邦人即使他们没有遵行犹太人的律法。雅各，耶路撒冷信徒的领导者，决定犹太人的律法不应该强加给外邦人。同时，他要求外邦人不应该冒犯或是犯罪。他们将这些决定写在一封信中。
B.Paul’s Second Missionary Journey (15:36-18:22)
保罗的第二次传道旅程（15:36-18:22）
Paul’s second missionary journey began with a disagreement between Paul and Barnabas (15:36-41). As a result Paul teamed up with Silas and traveled by land to Derbe and Lystra. In Lystra Paul met a young man named Timothy. He now became a member of Paul’s missionary team (16:1-5).
保罗的第二次传道行程以保罗和巴拿巴之间的争论开始（15:36-41）。结果是保罗与西拉一起经陆路去往特庇和路司得。在路司得保罗遇见了一位叫提摩太的年轻人。他这时成为了保罗传道队伍中的一员（16:1-5）。
The team then decided to move on to Ephesus, but they were stopped by the Holy Spirit. They then tried to go north, but again God said, “No.”So they went west to Troas. There, in a vision, Paul saw a man from Macedonia asking for help. Paul decided to go there (16:6-10). Verse 10 begins: “We got ready at once to leave for Macedonia.”. It seems that Luke joined Paul at this time.
然后这支队伍决定前往以弗所，但是他们却被圣灵禁止。他们又试图去往北方，但是神又一次对他们说，“不”。因此他们向西往特罗亚去了。在那里，在一个异象中，保罗看到一个马其顿人向他寻求帮助。保罗决定前往那里（16:6-10）。第十节一开始说到:“我们随即想要往马其顿去”。似乎路加在此时加入了保罗的队伍。
Once in Macedonia Paul immediately went to the city of Philippi. There Lydia was converted and she and her household were baptized (16:11-15). Sometime thereafter Paul cast a demon out of a girl, and that started a small riot. Paul and Silas were beaten and put in jail, but God caused their release and the conversion of the jailer and his family (16:16-40).
一到马其顿保罗就立刻往腓利比城去了。在那里吕底亚信了神的道，并且她的一家人都受了洗（16:1-15）。在那之后的某个时候，保罗将恶鬼从一个使女身上赶了出来并引起了一场小的暴乱。保罗和西拉被棍打并关进监牢，但是神使他得到释放并使禁卒和他的家人信了神的道（16:16-40）。
From Philippi the missionaries went to Thessalonica. There Paul preached for about a month. Many were converted but many more rejected the Gospel. Paul had to flee for his life at night (17:1-9).
传道人们从腓利比往帖撒罗尼迦去了。在那里保罗传讲神的道约有一个月。许多人都信了神的道，但是更多人拒绝领受福音。保罗不得不在夜间逃生（17:1-9）。
Paul next started a church in Berea. Soon, however, some of the Gospel’s enemies from Thessalonica came to Berea and made trouble. Paul left for Athens while Timothy and Silas stayed behind (17:10-15).
保罗随后在庇哩亚兴起教会。不久，福音的一些仇敌从帖撒罗尼迦来到庇哩亚并制造麻烦。保罗出发前往雅典但是提摩太和西拉仍住在庇哩亚（17:10-15）。
While in Athens Paul worked hard to bring Christ to the people there. Not many were converted (17:16-34) and no congregation was started there.
然而在雅典保罗努力将那里的人们带到基督面前。没有很多人相信神的道（17:16-34）而且没有会众在那里兴起。
Silas and Timothy joined Paul in Athens. But Paul then sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to gather news about the Christian church there (1 Thess. 3:2). When Timothy returned to Athens and spoke of the Christian’s faith and love, Paul sat down and wrote what we know as First Thessalonians. Paul then went on to Corinth. Perhaps a month or two after arriving, Paul found out what was happening in the church at Thessalonica. He then wrote Second Thessalonians to give them a proper understanding of Christ’s second coming.
西拉和提摩太在雅典和保罗会合。但是保罗之后将提摩太派回到帖撒罗尼迦去收集关于那里的基督教会的消息（帖撒罗尼迦前书3:2）。当提摩太返回雅典时，将基督徒的信心和爱心的消息讲给保罗他们听，保罗就坐下来写了我们所称的帖撒罗尼迦前书。然后保罗前往哥林多。或许在到达那里一两个月之后，保罗发现了帖撒罗尼迦教会中正发生的一些事情。他随后写了帖撒罗尼迦后书使得他们对基督的第二次到来有正确的理解。
Paul worked in Corinth for 18 months and a church was started there. Again Paul was persecuted for his teaching (18:1-17).
保罗在哥林多做了18个月的事工并且在那里兴起了一个教会。保罗再一次因为的教导受到逼迫（18:1-17）。
Leaving Corinth Paul made a quick stop in Ephesus and then went to Caesarea and Jerusalem. Finally, he returned to Antioch (18:18-22).
离开哥林多之后保罗在以弗所作了短暂的停留，然后就往凯撒利亚和耶路撒冷去了。最终，他返回了安提阿（18:18-22）。
C.Paul’s Third Missionary Journey (18:23-26:32)
保罗的第三次传道旅程（18:23-26:32）
The early part of Paul’s third missionary journey is told in a very few verses (18:11-13; 19:1). Paul traveled 1500 miles and visited many of the churches he had started.
关于保罗第三次传道行程的早期的情况仅仅在少数几节中被提到（18:11-13；19:1）。保罗通过1500英里的行程拜访了他已经兴起的许多教会。
Paul spent most of his third tour at Ephesus. There Priscilla and Aquila, whom Paul had taught at Corinth, met a Jewish preacher named Apollos. They shared more teachings about Jesus with him (18:24-28). Luther thought that Apollos wrote the Letter to the Hebrews although we are not sure.
保罗用了他第三次行程的大部分时间在以弗所做了停留。在那里保罗在哥林多所教导过的百基拉和亚居拉遇见了一个叫亚波罗的犹太传道人（18:24-28）。路德虽然不能确信但是仍认为亚波罗写信给希伯来人。
Paul preached in Ephesus for many months. His message was received by some but totally rejected by others. Even his miracles did not convince all the people (19:1-22).
保罗在以弗所进行了几个月的传道。他所传的信息被一些人领受，但是被其他人完全地拒绝了。甚至是他所行的神迹也没有使所有人信服（19:1-22）。
While Paul was in Ephesus he received word that things were not going well in the church at Corinth. Paul gave them advice in his First Corinthians.
当保罗在以弗所时他听到消息说在哥林多的教会遇到了困难。保罗在哥林多前书中给予了他们建议。
After a riot broke out in Ephesus (19:23-41) Paul moved on to Macedonia (20:1). There he wrote his Second Corinthians.. Soon after Paul traveled on to Greece (20:2-6). While in Corinth Paul wrote Romans.
在以弗所发生的一次骚乱之后（19:23-41）保罗前往了马其顿（20:1）。在那里他写了哥林多后书。之后不久，保罗往希腊去了（20:2-6）。当保罗在哥林多时，他写了罗马书。
After his visit to Greece and Macedonia, Paul decided to return to Jerusalem. On the way he stopped in Troas where he preached all night. Eutychus fell asleep and died after falling out a window. The Lord worked a miracle through Paul and the boy was revived(20:7-12).
在他拜访过希腊和马其顿之后，保罗决定返回耶路撒冷。在返回的路上，他在特罗亚作了停留并进行彻夜的讲道。犹推古睡着了并从窗台掉下去摔死了。主通过保罗行神迹使得那个男孩复活了（20:7-12）。
The Holy Spirit was calling Paul to Jerusalem, where the apostle felt he might be killed. Yet Paul hurried on toward the Jewish capital (21:1-16). First, however, he stopped near Ephesus to say goodbye to his friends (20:13-38). Paul had spent three years preaching the name of Jesus among the Ephesians.
圣灵呼召保罗去耶路撒冷，那里的使徒认为他可能被杀害了。虽然保罗匆忙赶往犹太人的首都（21:1-16）。他仍然先在以弗所附近的地方停留与他的朋友们告别（20:13-38）。保罗用了三年的时间在以弗所人中间传讲耶稣的名。
There were problems in the Jerusalem church. Some Jewish believers still felt they had to obey the Laws of Moses. Some thought Paul was turning his back on this kind of holy life. To end such talk Paul joined four Jewish Christians in a Jewish ceremony (21:17-26).
耶路撒冷的教会中存在一些问题。一些犹太的信徒仍然觉得应该遵行摩西的律法。一些人认为保罗正远离这种圣洁的生活。为了终止这样的谈论，保罗和四个犹太的基督徒一起行了洁净的礼（21:17-26）。
When the time came to do this Paul went to the temple. There he was grabbed and accused of breaking the law and making the temple unholy. A mob surrounded Paul and began to beat him, but a Roman commander rescued him (21:27-32).
当洁净的日期满足，保罗进了圣殿。在那里他被捉拿并被指违反律法和玷污圣殿。百姓围住保罗并开始打他，但是一个罗马的千夫长救了他（21:27-32）。
Paul, however, was concerned to tell the truth. He now defended himself before the Jews (21:33-22:21). When he reported that God told him to reach out to the Gentiles, the Jews shouted him down. The Romans kept Paul in prison (22:22-29).
尽管保罗曾被告知讲出实情。此时，他在犹太人面前为自己分诉（21:33-22:21）。当他对他们说神告诉他到外邦人那里去时，犹太人就高声制止他的讲话。罗马人将保罗关进监牢（22:22-29）。
Since the Romans did not understand why the mob was so angry with Paul, they brought him before the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin. Soon, however, those leaders were fighting among themselves (22:30-23:10). That night, Paul heard Jesus say, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome”(23:11).
因为罗马人没有明白为什么百姓对保罗如此愤怒，他们就将保罗带到犹太人治理的议会前，即公会。不久，那些公会中的领袖们却互相之间争斗起来（22:30-23:10）。那天晚上，保罗听到耶稣说，“放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证”（23:11）。
It was not God’s plan that Paul would die at this time (23:12-22). Paul was taken to the governor at Caesarea (23:23-35). There he spent two years under arrest. During his time in prison Paul was examined several times: before the Roman governor Felix (24:1-27) and his replacement Festus (25:1-22), and before the Jewish King Herod Agrippa (25:23-26:32).
神并没有计划让保罗在这时离世（23:12-22）。保罗被带到凯撒利亚的统治者那里（23:23-35）。他被关押在那里两年。在他被关押的时间里，保罗在腓力斯（24:1-27）和他的继任者非斯都（25:1-22）以及犹太人的王希律亚基帕面前（25:23-26:32）被审问了几次。
Throughout all of his trials Paul showed he was a bold and wise man. He had a true concern for the spiritual life of all men, even his accusers and judges.
保罗在所有的审问中都显示出他是一个有勇气有智慧的人。他真正关心的是所有人包括指责他和审问他的人的灵命。
Paul demanded his rights as a Roman citizen – to have his case heard by the Roman emperor. While waiting to be taken to Rome, Paul was under house arrest. He could receive news and visitors(Acts 24:23).
保罗提出他作为一个罗马公民的权利——将他的事情上报给罗马皇帝。在等待被带到罗马去的时间里，保罗被软禁。他能听到外面的消息并有人探望他（徒24:23）。
D.Paul’s Journey to Rome (27:1-28:31)
保罗的罗马旅程（27:1-28:31）
In chapter 27 Luke describes Paul’s boat trip to Rome. On the way the ship was caught in a storm and wrecked. Luke was with Paul and gives a complete description of these events. Through all the danger Paul was comforted by God’s promise, “Take courage . . . you must also testify in Rome”(23:11).
在27章中路加描写到保罗的乘船去罗马的行程。在航行的途中起了风暴并发生了海难。路加与保罗在一起因此对这些事情进行了完整地描写。经历这些危险时，保罗从神的应许中获得了安慰，“放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证”（23:11）。
After spending three months on the island of Malta (28:1-10) Paul, his fellow Christians and the soldiers got on another ship and sailed on to Italy. The Christians in Rome had read the letter Paul had wrote to them years before. Now they came far out of the city to meet Paul and bring him into Rome (28:11-16).
在马耳他登陆后，保罗在那里住了三个月（28:1-10）。保罗，跟随他的基督徒和兵丁们登上了另一艘船开往意大利。在罗马的基督徒们几年前读过保罗写给他们的信。现在他们从距离很远的城出来迎接保罗并将他带进罗马。(28:11-16)
One of Paul’s great hopes now took place: He could begin to witness to Christ in Rome. For two years Paul waited for his trial. During that time he was under house arrest in Rome. In addition to preaching (Acts 28:30-31), Paul took this chance to write the letters which have become known as the “Captivity Letters.” These are Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians and Philippians.
此时发生了保罗非常期盼的一件事。那时他被软禁在罗马。除了讲道以外（28:30-31），保罗借此机会被我们称为“被囚书信”的几封信。他们是:歌罗西书，腓利门书，以弗所书和腓利比书。
At this point Luke ends his story of the spread of the Christian Church. What happened to Paul after this? It seems that Paul was released by the Romans and traveled to Spain. After that the missionary again visited the churches in Asia Minor and Macedonia. While in Macedonia he wrote First Timothy to Timothy who had been put in charge of the church in Ephesus. Shortly after this he wrote Titus to the man he had put in charge of the church on the island of Crete. Then Paul was imprisoned in Rome a second time. There Paul wrote Second Timothy and in time was put to death as a martyr.
这时，路加以基督教会的兴旺结束了他的这部书。在此之后什么事情发生在保罗身上？看似保罗被罗马人释放并前往了西班牙。在那之后，这个传道人再次拜访了在小亚西亚和马其顿的教会。当他在马其顿时，他给安排负责在以弗所的教会的提摩太写了提摩太前书。这之后不久，他给安排负责在克里特岛的教会的人写了提多书。然后保罗第二次在罗马被关进监牢。保罗在那里写了提摩太后书并最后作为一名殉道者被杀害。
The last verse of Luke’s story serves as a good summary of Paul’s Christian life and service. He says, “Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ”(18:31).
路加这部书的最后一节成为了保罗基督徒生平和服侍工作的精辟总结。他说到，“放胆传讲神国的道，将主耶稣基督的事教导人，并没有人禁止”（18:31）。

The Writer
作者
St. Paul wrote the letter to the Romans (l:l). A man named Tertius was his secretary (16:22-23). Phoebe, who was making a trip from Corinth to Rome, delivered the letter (16:1-2). This was in A.D. 57 near the end of Paul’s third missionary trip.
圣徒保罗写了罗马书（1:1）。一个叫德丢的人是他的书记员（16:22-23）。非比，从哥林多来到罗马，传递信件（16:1-2）。这封信是在公元57年保罗第三次传道行程将结束的时候写的。
Paul’s Purpose in Writing
保罗的写作目的
Paul wrote this letter to believers living in Rome (16:5,10,11,14,15). Some of the members of these congregations may have been converted at Pentecost (Acts 2:10). Later, Christians from other areas, some converted by St. Paul, moved to Rome and joined the church there (16:3-15).
保罗给在罗马的信徒们写了这封信（16:5，10，11，14，15）。会众中的一些人在五旬节时信了神的道（使徒行传2:10）。之后，一些通过圣徒保罗信了神的道的基督徒们从其他地方来到罗马并加入了那里的教会（16:3-15）。
Paul wrote to the Romans from Corinth (compare Rom. 16:22-23 with 1 Cor. 1:14). He was planning a trip to Jerusalem to take a collection to the poor believers in that city. After that Paul wanted to do mission work in Spain but not without first visiting Rome (15:25-28; Acts 19:21).
保罗在哥林多给罗马人写信（比较罗马书16:22-23和哥林多书1:14）。他正计划去将捐项带给耶路撒冷圣徒中的穷人。在那之后，保罗希望去西班牙做传教工作因为在第一次探访罗马的时没有去到那里（15:25-28；使徒行传19:21）。
Paul wished to leave from Rome for his missionary work in western Europe. For this reason he wished the believers there to be firmly rooted in apostolic teaching and not to be weakened by arguments.
保罗希望离开罗马去西欧做传教工作。出于这个原因，他希望那里的信徒坚信使徒的教导不至于被争论削弱。
Romans is a letter which teaches many of the most important Christian doctrines. At the same time Paul discusses several matters which might cause problems in a congregation made up of both Jews and Gentiles.
罗马书是一封教导很多很重要的基督徒道理的书信。同时保罗谈论了一些有可能在犹太人和外邦人共同的教会中引发问题的重要事情。

Summary
概述
Theme: “I am not Ashamed of the Gospel”
主题:“我不以福音为耻”
The theme of Paul’s letter to the Romans is given in these words, “I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes”(1:16). The apostle clearly shows that he is not ashamed of the Gospel’s Person (Jesus), the Gospel’s power (salvation), or the Gospel’s promise (to everyone who believes).
保罗给罗马人的书信写了这些话，“我不以福音为耻；这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的”（1:16）。使徒明确的表示他不以福音的化身（耶稣），福音的大能（救恩），或福音的应许（给一切相信的人）。
1. Introduction (1:1-15)
引言（1:1-15）
Paul begins by saying that he has been called to be an apostle in order to preach the Gospel which brings salvation. He is sure that the Gospel is working among the Roman Christians and wants to come and meet them.
保罗一开始就说他被呼召做门徒是为了传福音将救恩带给众人。他确信福音在罗马的基督徒中间做工并希望见到他们。
2、. The Doctrine of Justification (1:16-5:21)
关于公义的道理（1:16-5:21）
God uses the good news of Jesus Christ to save those who believe it. This is the main point of the first five chapters of the letter. Paul first points out the need for righteousness (being declared blameless by God through faith) and then shows how the need can be met.
神用耶稣基督的好消息拯救那些相信这个消息的人。这是这封信前五章的重点。保罗首先指出对于公义的需要（靠着信心被神称为无可责备的）并指出这个需要如何得到满足。
A. The Universal Need For Justification(1:18-3:20)
普遍需要的公义（1:18-3:20）
People everywhere need to be right with God (1:16-17). This is also true for the Gentiles (1:18-32). Their sinfulness and worship of false gods show their rebellion against God. God’s Law condemns all such people.
任何地方的人都需要被神称为义（1:16-17）。对于外邦人来说这也是真理（1:18-32）。他们的罪性和对别神的敬拜表明了他们对神的悖逆。神的律法会定这样人的罪。
The Jews are no better than the Gentiles. The Gentiles have not listened to the voice of consciences. The Jews have gone against God’s word to them in the Law of Moses (2:1-29). “What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew . . .”(3:1). Paul says the Jews are blessed to have God’s written Word, but that will not help them if they still are guilty before God (3:1-8).
犹太人和外邦人一样。外邦人没有聆听神。犹太人违背神在摩西律法中对他们说的话（2:1-29）。“这么说来，犹太人有什么长处…”（3:1）。保罗说犹太人是蒙福的因为他们有神成文的话语，但是这对他们没有任何帮助如果他们在神面前被定为是有罪的（3:1-8）。
Thus, neither the Gentiles nor the Jews are of themselves righteous before God. The written Word of God given to the Jews makes this point (3:9-20).
因此，无论是外邦人还是犹太人都不能使自己在神面前称为义。神给予犹太人的成文话语就是要使众人明白这一点（3:9-20）。
B. How the Universal Need Was Met (3:21-5:21)
普遍的需求怎样保持一致（3:21-5:21）
Paul has first shown the universal need for men to be righteous in God’s sight. Now Paul shows how God answers this need. No one can become righteous through the law. Instead, righteousness comes only through faith in Christ Jesus. God has freely made it possible for man to be at one with him (atonement) through the saving work of Jesus (3:21-26). Therefore, all credit for salvation goes to God (3:27-31).
保罗首先指出众人都需要在神眼中被称为义。在这部书中保罗告诉众人神如何应许这个需求。没有人能通过律法被称为义。相反地，只有靠从基督耶稣来的信心才能被称为义。通过耶稣的救赎使众人与神同在（被赎）成为可能（3:21-26）。因此，救恩归于神（3:27-31）。
It is always true that “a man is justified by faith apart from obeying the law”(3:28). It was even true for Abraham (4:1-25). Abraham was saved by his faith and not by his works. This fact was established before he was circumcised, which shows that faith saves both those who are circumcised (Jews) and those who are not (Gentiles). Thus Abraham can be called the father of all believers from every ethnic or national background.
“人称义是因着信，不在乎遵行律法”（3:28）这一直是真理。对于亚伯拉罕是真理（4:1-25）。亚伯拉罕因着信得救不是因着做工。在他受割礼以前这个事实就已经存在了，这一点告诉我们了信心使受割礼的（犹太人）和没有受割礼的（外邦人）都得救。因此亚伯拉罕被称为来自各种族各国家的信徒之父。
Through faith a person can be at peace with God. This coming to peace (reconciliation) produces joy and the hope of glory even when someone is still suffering (5:1-11). This is all because of Jesus Christ, who is like the first man, Adam (5:12-21). Through Adam sin and death came into the world, but through Jesus come righteousness and life
一个人能靠着信心与神和好。这个和好带来喜乐和荣耀盼望甚至是人还在受苦难的时候（5:1-11）。由于亚当罪和死亡来到世上，但是靠着耶稣得着公义和生命。（5：12-21）
3、. The Doctrine of Sanctification (6:1-8:39)
关于成圣的道理（6:1-8:39）
Man’s salvation is earned by the work of Christ and we receive it through faith. What does this teaching of justification mean for how we live each day (sanctification)? Paul shows how our Christian faith gives the believer freedom from sin, the law, and death.
人获得的救赎是靠着基督的做工并凭着信心得到。公义的教导对于我们每天的生活有什么意义（成圣）？保罗告诉我们了我们基督徒的信心使基督徒从罪里，律法里和死里得释放。
A. Freedom from Sin (6:1-23)
从罪里得释放（6:1-23）
The believer is no longer a slave to sin. Christ died to pay for the sins of all mankind and then arose to a new life. When a person is baptized he receives the forgiveness of sins won by Christ’s death; and the Christian is raised to new life (6:1-14). Such a person has been freed from the slavery of sin and becomes a slave to God (6:15-23).
信徒不再是罪的奴役。基督为赎所有人的罪而死并从死里复生。当一个人受洗时就领受了基督用死为我们得到罪的赦免；并使基督徒从死里复活（6:1-14）。这样一个人从罪的奴役中得释放，成为了神的仆人（6:15-23）。
B. Freedom from Law (7:1-25)
从律法里得释放（7:1-25）
The believer also no longer lives as a slave to the law. Since the believer shares in Christ’s death, the believer is freed from the law which leads to sin and damnation. Instead, he is united with Christ in living a holy life (7:1-6). The law does lead to the sin it condemns, but this does not mean that the law is responsible for our sins. The old sinful nature of man is guilty. Not man but only God can defeat man’s sinful nature (7:7-25).
信徒也不再作为律法的奴役生活。因为基督为信徒而死，就从生出罪和咒诅的律法里得释放。相反，他与基督联合过圣洁的生活（7:1-6）。律法生出它所定罪的罪，但是这不意味着律法要为我们的罪负责。人过去的罪性是有罪的。只有神能战胜人的罪性（7:7-25）。
C. Freedom from Death (8:1-39)
从死里得释放（8:1-39）
Finally, believers in Christ are freed from death. They receive the Spirit of God which gives life in the place of sin and death (8:1-8). Through the Spirit they overcome the sinful nature, become sons of God and inherit eternal life with Christ (8:8-17). All created things on earth suffer as the result of sin. But believers know for certain that glory awaits them (8:18-27). How can they be so sure? Because God has chosen to save those whom he brings to faith (8:28-30). Believers can be certain of his love. It was this love which made him sacrifice his Son in the first place. Therefore, nothing can separate the believer “from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord”(8:39).
最后，信徒们在基督里从死里得释放。他们领受神的灵，那灵在生出罪和死的地方赐予生命（8:1-8）。靠着圣灵他们能战胜罪性，成为神的众子并与基督一起承受永生（8:17）。世上所有被造的都因罪受苦。但是信徒们确信荣耀在等着他们（8:18-27）。他们为何如此确信？因为神拣选他们并使他们得信心（8:28-30）。信徒们确信神的爱。这个爱使他牺牲他的独生子。因此，任何事都不能将信徒与“神的爱在耶稣基督我们的主里分开”（8:39）。
4. An Unusual Truth in Church History(9:1-11:36)
教会历史中的一个特殊的真理（9:1-11:36）
Paul has given the details of how man is reconciled to (made at peace with) God through the blood of Jesus Christ. He has also shown that this means Christians can live free from the slavery of sin, the law and death. Yet Paul also knows that his own people, the Jews, have not accepted Jesus. How can this be explained?
保罗详细说明了人如何通过耶稣基督的宝血与神和解（和好）。他也意味着基督徒能从罪，律法和死的奴役中得释放。然而保罗也知道他自己的人民，犹太人，还没有接受耶稣。这如何解释？
Paul shows that this agrees with what the Scripture says. He shows there are two types of children of Abraham -- those who are physical descendants and those who are his spiritual children. No promise of salvation was made to the physical children of Abraham (9:1-9). God also treats the unbelieving Jews in a just way (9:10-29). God chooses whoever he wishes to save. The Scriptures agree that God has a free will to do as he pleases. So rather than blaming God, Israel’s damnation is caused by its own unbelief (9:30-10:21). They try to become righteous in an impossible way -- by trying to obey God’s Law. But they do not accept the righteousness which Jesus Christ offers them through faith.
保罗告诉我们这一点和圣经上说的一致。他还告诉我们了亚伯拉罕的子孙有两类——属肉体的后裔和属灵的后裔。救恩的应许不是给亚伯拉罕那些属肉体的子孙的（9:1-9）。神也以公正对待不信他的犹太人（9:10-29）。神拣选那些他要救的人。圣经上也说神按自己的意愿而行。因此与其责怪神，应该说是以色列自己的不信导致咒诅（9:30-10:21）。他们试图以一种不可能的方式成义——通过试图遵行神律法的方式。但是他们不能接受耶稣基督通过信心带给他们的义。
However, not all the Jews have rejected the Gospel. God has preserved a faithful group of Christian Jews (11:1-10).
然而，不是所有犹太人都拒绝福音。神保守了一群信实的基督徒犹太人（11:1-10）。
Paul also shows that the unbelief of Israel has, in a way, led to the conversion of the Gentiles (11:11-24). However the Gentiles must not become proud. God still seeks the salvation of Israel (11:25-32). Paul is amazed at this continued love of God(11:33-36).
保罗还告诉我们以色列的不信，一方面却使得外邦人信了神的道（11:11-24）。然而外邦人不应变得骄傲。神仍然希望以色列得到救恩（11:25-32）。保罗对神的这种无尽的爱感到惊奇（11:33-36）。
5. Guidelines for Christian Living(12:1-15:13)
基督徒生活的原则（12:1-15:13）
Paul begins the next section of his letter with the word “therefore.” So far he had taught about God’s undeserved love for sinners. In light of this the Christians should live in a proper relationship with God (12:1-2) and with fellow congregational members (12:3-8). The love for God should be seen in every part of a Christian’s life. Christians are to conquer evil with good (12:9-21). The believer also is expected to obey the government (13:1-7) since God has put it in power. Love should guide how we act towards other people (13:8-10). This is important since the time of Christ’s second coming is not far away (13:11-14).
保罗用“所以”这个词开始了他信的下一部分的内容。至此他已经教导了关于神给的罪人不配得的爱。鉴于这一点，基督徒应该与神（12:1-2）以及与其他会众（12:3-8）维系合宜的关系。基督徒生活时时刻刻都应该体现对神的爱。基督徒要用善行战胜恶行（12:9-21）。神也希望信徒服从政府（13:1-7），因为神赋予政府权柄。爱应当引导我们待人的方式（13:8-10）。这些原则非常重要因为基督第二次到来的时间已经接近了（13:11-14）。
Paul now tells the Roman believers to live these principles in their own congregation (14:1-15:13). Since their congregation was made up of Jewish and Gentile Christians, there would be disagreements over what foods could be eaten and what festivals should be celebrated. Paul tells the Christians to think of the good of others, to be tolerant and understanding. He challenges the strong “to bear with the failings of the weak” (15:1). Above all, Paul encourages a spirit of unity.
在此保罗告诉罗马的信徒们在自己的教会中遵守这些原则（14:1-15:13）。因为他们的教会中有犹太的基督徒和外邦的基督徒，他们可能会对吃什么食物和庆祝什么节日有不同意见。保罗告诉基督徒要记念别人的善，并宽容和理解别人。他给坚固的人的挑战是“担代不坚固人的软弱”（15:1）。最重要的是，保罗鼓励灵里面的合一。
6. Conclusion (15:14-16:27)
总结（15:14-16:27）
In his letter Paul has taught basic Christian truths and applied them to life. He has called for unity among the Roman believers. Paul hopes his readers have taken this message to heart. If so, then Paul can better use Rome to help spread the gospel to the people of Western Europe (15:14-33).
在他的信中，保罗已经教导了有关基督徒的基本真理并应用到他们的生活中。他已经要求罗马的信徒们合一。保罗希望他的读者记住这个信息。这样，保罗就能更好的通过罗马将福音传给西欧的人（15:14-33）。
Paul also greets some old friends and other Christians in Rome whom he has heard about (16:1-16). Before sending greetings from those with him, Paul once again calls for a unity based on an agreement in Christian teachings (16:17). Paul then closes with a missionary blessing (16:25-27).
保罗也向一些老朋友和其他在罗马听到这个信息的人问安（16:1-16）。在通过和他一起的人将问候传递出去之前，保罗再一次要求在基督徒教导一致的基础上的合一（16:17）。然后保罗以传道的祝福结束了这封信（16:25-27）。
