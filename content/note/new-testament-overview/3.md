第二章：外邦人和基督徒的耶稣: 路加福音和约翰福音 （Chapter 2）
Chapter 2：Jesus For Gentiles And Christians: Luke and John
第二章：外邦人和基督徒的耶稣: 路加福音和约翰福音
Introduction
引言
The Gospels of Luke and John are very different in form and content. Luke wrote especially for Gentiles. John wrote for Christians in general. But this alone does not explain how different the books are from one another. The writers had different purposes for writing accounts of Jesus’ life. Luke was not one of the 12 Apostles and had never met Jesus. So he got the details about Jesus life from people who had heard and seen Christ. In this way the Gentiles who heard or read his Gospel would have a true knowledge of Jesus’ life and teachings. Meanwhile John, the disciple whom Jesus especially loved, wrote for Christians in general. He wished to strengthen them in their faith and keep them from accepting any false teachings about the Savior.
路加福音和约翰福音无论在形式还是内容上，都有很大的不同。路加福音是写给外邦人的。约翰福音是写给所有基督徒的。但这还不足以说明两部福音书的区别。显然，作者根据不同的目的而选择了不同的视角，来记录耶稣的生活。路加不是十二个使徒之一，他从没见过耶稣。因此他从听过和见过耶稣的人那里了解耶稣生活的细节。通过这种方式，听过或读过他的福音书的外邦人能正确的理解耶稣的生活和教导。而约翰，耶稣特别喜爱的门徒，的福音书是写给所有基督徒的。他希望坚固他们的信心并使他们远离关于救主的错误教导。
Luke
路加福音
The Writer
作者
The third Gospel was written by a Gentile named Luke. Luke continued the story in this Gospel by writing a follow-up book -- the Acts of the Apostles (Luke 1:4; Acts 1:1-2). Luke was a doctor (Col. 4:14), so both of his books contain especially exact medical descriptions (compare Matt. 8:14 with Luke 4:38; 5:12).
第三部福音书为一个叫路加的外邦人所写。路加通过他写的后续的一部书-使徒行传（路加福音1:4；使徒行传1:1-2）继续讲述这部福音书之后的故事。路加是一位医生（歌罗西书4:14），因此他写的两部书都含有对医学方面非常精确的描述（比较马太福音8:14和路加福音4:38；5:12）
Luke’s Purpose in Writing
路加福音的写作目的
Luke and Acts are dedicated to “most excellent Theophilus” (Acts 1:3). Theophilus seems to be an important Roman man who had become a Christian. Luke’s books are written to give him complete certainty of the things he had been taught about Christ (1:4).
路加福音和使徒行传都是写给“最优秀的提阿非罗”（路加福音1:3）。提阿非罗似乎是一个非常重要的成为了基督徒的罗马人。路加的福音书是写给他使他完全确信他被教导的关于耶稣的事情（1:4）。
However, besides Theophilus, Luke was writing to Gentile believers in general. For example,Luke makes frequent use of Roman dates (cf 1:5; 2:1-2, etc.). He does not trace history back to the father of the Jews (see Matt 1:1) but to the first man (3:38). He does not often quote from the Old Testament. Instead of using Hebrew terms, he prefers to use Greek words (compare Matt. 27:33 with Luke 23:33). Likewise, Luke never refers to Jesus with the Hebrew term Rabbi but instead uses a Greek word meaning Master. Finally, he shows how Jesus made it perfectly clear that he was the Savior of all mankind, yes, the Savior of the Gentiles too (2:10,31-32;3:6; 24:47).
然而，除了提阿非罗，路加福音也是写给所有信徒的。例如，路加经常使用罗马日期（参见1:5；2:1-2，等）。他不是只将历史追溯到犹太人之父（参看马太福音1:1）而是到世上的第一个人（马太福音3:38）。他没有大量引用旧约。和用希伯来词语相比，他更倾向于使用希腊语（比较马太福音27:33和路加福音23:33）。而且，路加从不以希伯来词语“拉比”来称呼耶稣而是用希腊语中意思为主人的词来称呼他。最后，他展示了耶稣如何完全地向人们显明他就是所有人的救主，是的，也是外邦人的救主（2:10，31-32；3:6；24:47）。
Luke must have gotten much of the information for his Gospel from Paul. The doctor often traveled with Paul and spent time with him when Paul was in prison (Col. 4:14; Philemon 24; 2 Tim. 4:11). Luke may have completed his book about A.D. 67.
路加的福音书中的很多信息一定从保罗那里获得的。这位医生经常和保罗一起，参加他的传教行程并且当保罗在监狱里的时候，他和保罗在一起（歌罗西书4:14；腓力门书24；提摩太后书4:11）。路加可能是在公元67年完成他的这部福音书。

Summary
概述
Theme: “Great Joy that will be for All the People”
主题:“大喜的信息，关乎万民”
Two great thoughts run through Luke’s Gospel. First, Jesus is the Savior for all mankind, Jews and Gentiles alike. The second thought is linked to the first -- all men are sinners and Jesus is a friend of sinners. The theme of the entire book was stated by the angels to the shepherds at Jesus’ birth, “I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people”(2:10).
两个伟大的思想贯穿了路加福音。第一个是耶稣是所有人的救主，犹太和外邦人是同等的。第二个思想和第一个思想是相关——所有人都是罪人，耶稣是罪人的朋友。这部福音书的主题就是天使在耶稣诞生时向牧羊人传达的话，“我报给你们大喜的信息，是关乎万民的”（2:10）。
1. Dedication (1:1-4)
引言（1:1-4）
Luke dedicates this volume (as well as Acts) to Theophilus. At the same time he explains how he got the information he has put down in writing.
路加指出这卷书（和使徒行传一样）是写给提阿非罗的。同时解释了他如何获得他写下的这些信息。
2. The Early Years of John the Baptist and Jesus (1:5-2:52)
施洗约翰和耶稣年幼的时候（1:5-2:52）
The first three chapters of Luke show the similarities and differences between the early years of John the Baptist and those of Jesus. First Gabriel predicts the birth of John the “forerunner”(1:5-25) and then he tells Mary that she will become the mother of Jesus (1:26-38). At this point the mothers of John and Jesus get together, and Mary declares her faith (1:39-56).
路加福音的前三章告诉我们了年幼的施洗约翰和耶稣的相似之处和不同之处。加百列首先预告了“先驱者”施洗约翰的诞生（1:5-25），然后他告诉马利亚她会成为耶稣的母亲（1:26-38）。此时，约翰的母亲和耶稣的母亲见到了，而且马利亚表明了她的信心（1:39-56）。
Second comes the birth of John and his father’s reaction (1:57-80) followed by Jesus’ birth and the joy it gave to the angels and the Bethlehem shepherds (2:1-20).
接下来是约翰的诞生和他父亲的反应（1:57-80），然后是耶稣的诞生以及他带给天使和牧羊人们的喜悦（2:1-20）。
Luke then puts the story of John aside and tells the early history of Jesus. At the age of 8 days Jesus was circumcised and named (2:21). On the 40th day after his birth he was taken to the temple in Jerusalem (2:22-38) where Simeon saw the Child and called him “a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for the glory to your people Israel”(2:32). He said clearly that Jesus was the Savior for “all people”(2:31). There in the temple the prophetess Anna also met Jesus.
然后路加暂时从约翰的故事转到讲耶稣幼年时的历史。耶稣出生第八天受割礼并得名（2:21）。他出生后40天被带到耶路撒冷的圣殿中（2:22-38），在那里西面这个孩子，并称他“是照亮外邦人的光，又是你民以色列的荣耀”（2:23）。他清楚地说道耶稣是“所有人”的救主（2:31）。在圣殿中女先知亚拿也见到了耶稣。
The next decade of Jesus’ life is described in just two verses (2:39-40). But it is Luke who tells the story of the 12 year old Jesus’ visit to the temple (2:41-52). There we have the earliest words of Jesus recorded in the Bible (2:49).
耶稣接下来的十年生活仅用了两句话进行了描写（2:39-40）。但是路加讲述了耶稣12岁时进到圣殿里的事情（2:41-52）。在那里我们得到了圣经中记录的耶稣最早的话语（2:49）。
3. The Preparation for Jesus’ Ministry(3:1-4:13)
预备耶稣的传道（3:1-4:13）
When we next meet up with John he is 30 years old. In order to prepare people to meet the Lord he preached and baptized (3:1-20).
当我们再次在这部书中看到约翰时他已经30岁了。为了预备人们遇见主，他宣讲神的话语并为人们施洗（3:1-20）。
Soon it was time for Jesus to begin his public ministry. Jesus was baptized by John (3:21-38). At that time the Holy Spirit made it clear that Jesus’ ministry was the will of his Father.
不久，到了耶稣开始他公开传道的时候了。约翰为耶稣施洗（3:21-38）。那时，圣灵向人们显明耶稣的传道是神的意愿。
The devil, terrified at the thought of Jesus’ ministry, tempted the Lord for 40 days (4:1-13). Jesus overcame each temptation of the Evil One.
魔鬼，想到耶稣的传道感到害怕，就试探了主40天（4:1-13）。耶稣战胜了魔鬼的每一次试探。
4. The Ministry of Jesus in Galilee and to the North (4:14-9:50)
耶稣在加利利以及北方地区的传道（4:14-9:50）
Luke skips over the early ministry of Jesus in Judea and Samaria (John 1:35-4:42) and describes Jesus’ work in and around Galilee. In his sermon in Nazareth Jesus showed himself to be a friend of sinners, but sinners rejected him (4:14-30).
路加省略了耶稣在犹太和撒玛利亚（约翰福音1:35-4:42）的早期传教以及对耶稣在加利利和其周边所做事情的描写。耶稣在拿撒勒的讲道显明了他是罪人的朋友，但是罪人弃绝他（4:14-30）。
Leaving Nazareth behind Jesus made Capernaum the center of his Galilean ministry. There he drove out evil spirits and healed many people (4:31-44). Nearby at the Sea of Galilee, he preached and called his disciples (5:1-11).
离开了拿撒勒，耶稣使迦百农成为他在加利利地区传道的中心。在那里他赶出污鬼并治好许多人（4:31-44）。在加利利海附近，他讲道并召他的门徒（5:1-11）。
Luke pictures the Lord as a person filled with compassion. Jesus showed this when he healed a leper (5:12-16) and a paralyzed man (5:17-26). The Savior showed his love for sinners when he called a well-known sinner, a tax collector named Levi (Matthew), to be one of his disciples (5:27-32).
路加向我们展示了耶稣作为人充满了怜悯。耶稣在他治好长大麻风的人（5:12-16）和瘫子（5:17-26）时就显出了这一点。当他召一个有名的名叫利未（马太）税吏成为他的一个门徒时（5:27-32），救主显出了他对罪人的爱。
Luke’s picture of Christ Jesus also shows him to be a master teacher. When asked a simple question about fasting Jesus replied in parables (5:36-39). Luke’s Gospel records more parables than any other. Of the 34 main parables found in the four Gospels, Luke includes 23. Eighteen of these are found nowhere else.
路加对基督耶稣的描述还揭示了耶稣是一位优秀的老师。当被问到一个关于禁食的简单问题时，耶稣用几个比喻回答了这个问题（5:36-39）。路加福音记录的福音比其他的福音书都要多。四部福音书一共记录了34个主要的比喻，路加福音中就有23个。其中的18个在其他的书中都没有记录。
The master teacher used everything he could to bring people to the truth. When opposed by the Pharisees, he turned to the Old Testament to explain his actions (6:1-11). And Jesus was brilliant when it came to preaching. He proved this when he delivered the Sermon on the Mount (6:12-49).
这位优秀的老师尽一切可能把人们引向真理。当他被法利赛人反对时，他转而用旧约来解释他的作为（6:1-11）。并且耶稣在讲道时是非常有智慧的。他在讲授登山宝训时证明了这一点（6:12-49）。
At this point Luke recounts two more miracles of Jesus. In all, doctor/historian Luke records 21 miracles, more than Matthew, Mark or John.
在这一部分，路加有讲述了两个耶稣所行的神迹。总之，医生/历史学家路加福音记录了21个神迹，比马太福音，马可福音或约翰福音都要多。
Since Luke was writing for Gentiles, they must have been thrilled to read about Jesus’ contact with a Roman army officer (centurion). Not only did the Lord heal his servant, but he also commented that the officer had a “great faith”(7:1-10).
因为路加福音是写给外邦人的，他们在读到耶稣和罗马军队的指挥官（百夫长）有接触的时候一定很紧张。主不仅医好了那个百夫长的仆人，他还对众人说百夫长有“大的信心”（7:1-10）。
Soon afterward Jesus showed his power over death by bringing a widow’s son back to life (7:11-17). The Lord’s compassion for this widow was as great as his power over death.
不久，耶稣通过使寡妇的儿子复活显现了他战胜死亡能力（7:11-17）。主对寡妇的怜恤和他战胜死亡的力量一样伟大。
Jesus felt that the Roman soldier was special. He felt even more strongly about John the Baptist, who by this time was in prison. John’s disciples meet Jesus and Jesus praises John (7:18-35).
耶稣感到这个罗马士兵很特别。他对此时正在监狱中的施洗约翰有更深的感动。约翰的门徒来见耶稣，耶稣称赞约翰（7:18-35）。
Earlier Luke reported on Jesus’ love for sinners as when the Lord called Levi to be a disciple. The same lesson is learned from the story of the sinful woman pouring perfume on Jesus’ feet (7:36-50).
早先路加讲述过主耶稣召利未成为门徒时他对罪人的爱。从有罪的女人膏抹耶稣的故事中我们认识到同样的真理（7:36-50）。
Women are mentioned often in Luke’s history of Jesus’ birth, life and death (Elizabeth, Mary, the widow at Nain, the woman who washed Jesus’ feet, Mary Magdalene, Jairus’ daughter, etc.). Here (8:1-3) we learn that believing women helped support Jesus’ ministry with their own money.
路加关于耶稣从出生，在世上生活直到离世的历史记录中常常提到妇女们（如:伊利沙伯，马利亚，在拿因的寡妇，为耶稣洗脚的妇人，抹大拉的马利亚，睚鲁的女儿，等等）。在此（8:1-3）我们认识到有信心的妇女们用自己的财物供给耶稣以帮助他传道。
Luke then returns to write about Jesus the teacher. This time Jesus spoke in parables and shows how close he feels to those who hear and obey his words (8:4-21).
路加又转回到描写作为老师的耶稣。这一次耶稣用寓言所说的话显示出他感到那些听他话并顺服的人和他关系亲近（8:4-21）。
One day Jesus decided to leave Galilee. During a stormy boat ride, he calmed the seas (8:22-25). He arrived on the east side of the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Gerasene people. There he commanded a large number of demons to leave the man whom they had been torturing (8:26-39).
有一天，耶稣决定离开加利利。在暴风中乘船的过程中，他平静了风浪（8:22-25）。他到了加利利海的东面格拉森人的地方。在那里他吩咐一群污鬼从被他们折磨的人身上出来（8:26-39）。
Upon returning home Jesus was called to the home of Jairus, whose daughter was sick and soon died. Jesus raised her back to life (8:40-56) thereby showing his power and love.
在回家的途中，耶稣被请求到睚鲁的家中，因为他的女儿病得很重，不久就死了。耶稣使他的女儿从死里复活（8:40-56）从而显示了他的大能和爱。
By this time the disciples had learned much from Jesus. Now it was their turn to go out preaching (9:1-9). When they returned, Jesus wanted time alone with them. However, a crowd of people would not leave him alone. After preaching to them he fed more than 5000 people at one time (9:10-17).
到此时，门徒们已经从耶稣那里学到了很多。现在是他们出去宣传神的道的时候了（9:1-9）。当他们回来的时候，耶稣希望单独和门徒们在一起。然而，众人们跟着他们去。在向众人们讲道之后，耶稣同时使五千人吃饱（9:10-17）。
Jesus was finally able to find some time to spend alone with his disciples. He asked who the crowds and the disciples thought he was. Peter boldly said that Jesus was the Christ, God’s Son. Jesus then discussed the price that his disciples would pay for following him (9:18-27).
耶稣终于能有时间单独和门徒们在一起了。他问他们说众人们和门徒们说他是谁。彼得大胆地说耶稣是基督，是神的儿子。然后耶稣讨论了门徒们为了跟从他愿意付出的代价（9:18-27）。
Eight days later Jesus again proved himself to be the Son of God when he was transfigured. He spoke to Moses and Elijah about his own death (9:28-36).
八天后，耶稣在他登山变像时再次他是神的儿子。他同摩西和以利亚谈论他离世的事（9:28-36）。
The next day was spent in healing and teaching (9:37-45). Luke was not afraid to show that Jesus’ disciples often wasted their time in arguments (9:46-50).
第二天，耶稣医治被污鬼附着的男孩和教导门徒（9:37-45）.路加不怕展现门徒们经常浪费他们的时间来互相争论（9:46-50）。
5. The Ministry of Jesus in Samaria, Judea and Perea (9:51-19:27)
耶稣在撒玛利亚，犹太和佩雷阿的传道（9:51-19:27）
Jesus had spent more than a year and a half in Galilee. The forerunner John the Baptist was now dead. Jesus knew that he too must die even as he had predicted (9:22, 43-45). Jesus now began his final trip to Jerusalem, making stops in Samaria, Perea and Judea.
耶稣住在加利利超过一年半的时间。先驱施洗约翰已经离世。耶稣知道他自己也会如他已经预言过的一样离世（9:22，43-45）。耶稣开始了他在耶路撒冷的最后一次行程，他在撒玛利亚，佩雷阿和犹太作了停留。
Jesus’ slow journey toward Jerusalem appears only in Luke’s Gospel (9:51-17:10). In this section Luke records some of Jesus’ greatest parables and most clear teachings.
耶稣去往耶路撒冷的漫长行程只出现在路加福音中（9:51-17:10）。在这一部分，路加记录了耶稣所讲的一些最重要的比喻和最明确的教导。
The people of Samaria did not receive Jesus warmly (9:51-55). But Jesus continued to love them and all other sinners. Soon he sent 70 of his disciples on a preaching mission (10:1-24).
撒玛利亚人不接待耶稣（9:51-55）。但是耶稣仍然爱他们和所有其他有罪的人。不久，他差遣他的七十个门徒到各地方去进行传道（10:1-24）。
Afterward Jesus did some teaching of his own. Only Luke records the parable of the Good Samaritan (10:25-37) and the important “one thing is needed”talk with Mary and Martha (10:38-42).
后来耶稣自己又对人们进行了一些教导。只有路加记载了良善的撒玛利亚人的比喻（10:25-37）并且重要的“不可少的一件事情”是与马利亚和马大的谈话（10:38-42）。
Jesus taught what his listeners needed to hear. The disciples learned more about prayer (11:1-13) while the Pharisees were warned about their sins (11:37-54).
耶稣教导那些听他话的人想要听到的真理。门徒们学到了更多关于如何祷告（11:1-13），法利赛人因为他们的罪恶被警告（11:37-54）。
In Luke 12:1-13:9 we see an excellent example of Jesus’ willingness to bring God’s message to all men. Here Jesus spoke to his disciples warning them against hypocrisy and encouraging them to defend the message of God’s good news (12:1-12). When he was interrupted by a man concerned with his earthly wealth, Jesus replied by teaching about the proper attitude towards earthly wealth (12:13-21).
在路加福音12:1-13:9中，我们看到耶稣希望将神的消息带给所有人所作的出色榜样。在这里，耶稣告诉他的门徒要警惕假冒为善的人并勉励门徒们要为神的好消息分诉（12:1-12）。当他被一个只关心自己在地上的财富的人打断说话的时候，耶稣通过关于对待地上财富的正确态度的教导回答了那个人（12:13-21）。
Once again speaking to the disciples, he told them not to worry but to be prepared for his second coming (12:22-59). The teaching about Judgment Day made some people think about some current events, so Jesus also discussed them (13:1-9).
再次对门徒们说，他告诉他们不要忧虑但是预备他的第二次到来（12:22-59）。关于审判日的教导使一些人思考当时发生的一些事情，因此耶稣也和他们讨论了那些事情（13:1-9）。
Besides teaching, Jesus’ love moved him to heal a crippled woman. This angered some of the Jews and made others rejoice. The healing led to the telling of a parable (13:10-21).
除了教导，耶稣对众人的爱使得他医好了一个驼背的女人。这件事使一些犹太人愤怒，但使另一些人欢喜。这次的治愈引出了一个比喻（13:10-21）。
On his way to Calvary Jesus had passed through Samaria and had spent some time working in Judea. Now he went through the towns and villages of Perea teaching, preaching, speaking parables, and performing miracles (13:22-17:10). When we read Luke’s summary of Jesus’ Perean ministry, we are awed by Jesus’ concern for sinners. He was constantly bothered by people and large crowds, yet he took time to listen, to address people’s concerns and answer their questions. He spoke in a way that his hearers could understand, most often in parables. Special mention should be made of the parables recorded in Luke 15. This chapter has been called the “golden center of this Gospel.” It shows the Savior’s love for lost and condemned sinners. At the heart of the golden center is the Parable of the Prodigal Son.
在他去骷髅地的路上，耶稣曾经过撒玛利亚并在犹太作了停留并教导众人。现在经过佩雷阿的各城各乡教训人，讲道，说比喻并且显神迹（13:22-17:10）。当我们读到路加福音关于耶稣在佩雷阿传道的概要时，耶稣对于有罪的人的关心使我们敬畏。虽然耶稣不停地被众人打扰，但他还是花时间倾听他们，面对他们的疑问并回答他们的问题。他以听他话的人能理解的方式对他们说，最常用的是比喻的方式。特别值得注意的是路加福音中记录的比喻有15个。这一章节被称为“福音的黄金中心”。它向我们显现了救主对迷失的和被定罪的罪人的爱。这个黄金中心的核心是回头的浪子。
As splendid as Jesus’ teachings are we must not forget that at this time in his life Jesus was traveling to his death. “Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee”(17:11). It was on that walk that he healed ten men suffering with leprosy. Unfortunately, only one man was moved to thank Jesus (17:11-19).
和耶稣的教导一样辉煌的是我们所不能忘记的耶稣在他的一生中一直行走各地直到他离世。“耶稣往耶路撒冷去，经过撒玛利亚和加利利”（17:11）。正是在那次行程途中，他医好了十个长大麻风的人。但不幸的是，只有一个人回来感谢耶稣（17:11-19）。
Since his death was coming quickly, Jesus reviewed many of his main teachings for his disciples. He spoke about the Kingdom of God at that very time (17:20-21) and in the future (17:22-37). He urged his disciples to always be praying (18:1-8). He warned the hypocrites with a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector (18:9-14). When the disciples went wrong, he held up little children as examples for them(18:15-17).
由于死亡即将到来，耶稣为他的门徒们回顾他的许多主要教导。他讲了关于神的国在那时（17:20-21）和将来（17:22-37）的事情。他要求他的门徒们常常祷告（18:1-8）。他用一个关于法利赛人和税吏的比喻（18:9-14）警告假冒为善的人。当门徒们犯错误时，耶稣抱起婴孩来给他们举例（18:15-17）。
Jesus was thinking about the salvation of sinners as he came to Jerusalem. He showed a man full of pride in his own deeds that he was not on the road to salvation (18:18-30). Eternal life could only come through Jesus’ death, which Jesus once again predicts (18:31-34). After healing a blind beggar (18:35-43) he brought salvation to a sinner named Zacchaeus (19:1-10). Jesus’ love for lost souls is made clear. Jesus says to Zacchaeus, “I must stay at your house today.” Later he rejoices that “today salvation has come to this house” (19:5,9). Finally, Jesus once again returned to one of his favorite subjects, the coming of the Kingdom of God (19:11-27).
当耶稣来到耶路撒冷，他所想的是有罪的人得救恩。他使一个满怀自信的人了解到那个人自己的行为不能使他通往得救恩的路（18:18-30）。永生只可能通过耶稣的死实现，这是耶稣再一次预言自己的死（18:31-34）。在医好一个盲丐之后（18:35-43），耶稣将救恩带给一名叫撒该的罪人（19:1-10）。我们清楚地看到耶稣对迷失的灵魂的爱。耶稣对撒该说，“今天我必住在你家里。”之后，他欢喜“今天救恩到了这家”（19:5，9）。最后，耶稣再一次回到他特别喜爱的一个话题，神的国的降临（19:11-27）。
6. The Week of Jesus’ Suffering and Death(19:28-23:56)
耶稣受难周和离世（19:28-23:56）
Luke now carefully writes down what happened during the week of Jesus’ suffering and death. It began with his entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday (19:28-40) and ended with his death on the cross on Good Friday.
路加在这一部分中详细地记录了耶稣受难和离世的这一周中所发生的事情。这一周以耶稣在棕枝主日进入耶路撒冷为起点（19:28-40）并以耶稣在受难日被钉死在十字架上结束。
During the early part of the week, Jesus finished his public ministry. On Palm Sunday he told of his sadness for Jerusalem, a beautiful city of wicked people (19:41-44). On Tuesday Jesus was in the temple (20:1-21:38). While much of his day was spent answering the questions and challenges of his enemies, he did see a humble believer drop two small coins in the offering (21:1-4). It perhaps was also on that Tuesday that Judas Iscariot made his final decision to betray Jesus for money (22:1-6).
在这一周的早些时候，耶稣完成了他的公开传道。在棕枝主日他说出了他为耶路撒冷这座美丽城中的恶人感到悲哀（19:41-44）。星期二，耶稣在圣殿中（20:1-21:38）。但是这一天中的大部分时间耶稣都在回答问题和应对敌人们的挑战，他看到了一个谦卑的信徒将两个小钱投在库里（21:1-4）。可能也是在星期二，加略人犹大最终决定因为钱背叛耶稣（22:1-6）。
None of the Gospels tell us what Jesus did on Wednesday. On Thursday Jesus turned the Passover meal into the “Lord’s Supper”(22:7-20). Luke pictures the disciples that night: Judas was ready to betray Jesus (22:22); the other disciples argued about “which of them was considered to be the greatest”(22:24); and Peter was corrected and warned (22:31-34).
任何福音书都没有告诉我们耶稣在星期三做了什么。星期四耶稣将逾越节筵席变为主的晚餐（22:7-20）。路加描写了那天晚上使徒们的情况:犹大准备背叛耶稣（22:22）；另一些门徒争论起“他们中间谁为大”（22:24）；彼得被告诫和提醒（22:31-34）。
Next came Jesus’ suffering in the garden called Gethsemane, his arrest, Peter’s denial, and Jesus’ “trials” and beatings (22:39-23:25). Then the time came for Jesus’ crucifixion (23:26-49). Here again Luke shows his readers Jesus’ love for sinners. The Lord warns the women of the coming disaster (23:28-31), prays for those who were killing him (23:34), promises paradise to a repentant criminal (23:43), and, above all, dies for the sins of all mankind. Jesus then was laid in the tomb (23:50-56).
接下来是耶稣在客西马尼园中受苦，被捕，彼得不认耶稣，耶稣受审问和鞭打（22:39-23:25）。然后到了耶稣被钉十字架的时候（23:26-49）。在此，路加再一次向他的读者展现了耶稣对有罪的人的爱。主耶稣警戒妇女们灾难将要到来（23:28-31），为那些要杀害他的人祷告（23:34），向悔改的犯人应许他们将与他同在神的国里（23:43），并且，最重要的是，为所有人的罪舍弃生命。耶稣被安放在坟墓里（23:50-56）。
7. The Resurrection, Appearances, and Ascension of Jesus (24:1-53)
耶稣的复活，显现，和升天（24:1-53）
Luke must have been filled with happiness as he wrote the last part of his Gospel. “He has risen” he writes (24:6). He then writes that the Lord was seen alive by eyewitnesses (24:9-49). Luke’s description of the conversation between Jesus and the two men on the road to Emmaus (24:13-35) shows beautifully the meaning of Jesus’ resurrection for believers. Luke ends his first book by mentioning Jesus’ ascension. His second book, Acts, begins with this same story.
路加在写这部福音的最后一部分的时候一定是被喜乐充满的。他写道“他已经复活了”（24:6）。然后他写道主耶稣被其他人看到还活着（24:9-49）。路加对耶稣和两个门徒在去往以马忤斯路上的对话（24:13-35）的描写很好地展现了耶稣为信徒复活的意义。路加通过提及耶稣的升天结束了他的第一部书。他的第二部书，使徒行传，以对同样事情的叙述开始。

The Writer
作者
The writer of the fourth Gospel is not named in the book, but the book gives us many clues. He was a Jew able to quote from the Hebrew Old Testament (12:40; 13:18; 19:37). He was familiar with Jewish festivals (2:13; 7:37). He was also familiar with Palestinian geography (2:12; 19:17). More importantly he was an eyewitness to the deeds and preaching of Jesus (1:14; 19:35; 21:24). Clearly the author was one of the Twelve Disciples, but which one?
第四部福音书的作者的名字没有出现在书中，但是这部书给我们了很多线索。他是一个犹太人并能引用希伯来文所写的旧约（12:40；13:18；19:37）。他熟悉犹太人的节日（2:13；7:37）。他也熟悉巴勒斯坦地区的地理（2:12；19:17）。更重要的是他是耶稣所做的事和传道的见证（1:14；19:35；21:24）。很显然作者是十二门徒中的一个，但是是哪一个呢？
The early Christian church was certain that it was John. In this Gospel one of the disciples is referred to, not by name, but by the phrase “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7). This was John.
早期的基督教会确信作者就是约翰。在这部福音书中，提到了其中的一个门徒，没有提到他的名字，但是通过“耶稣所爱的门徒”这句话可以知道（13:23；19:26；20:2；21:7）。他就是约翰。
Early writers said that John lived in Ephesus (in Asia Minor, today’s Turkey) at the time this book was written. It was probably written between A.D. 95 and 97.
早期的作家们认为约翰在写这部书的时候生活在以弗所（小亚西亚，现在的土耳其）。这部福音书可能写于公元95至公元97年。
John’s Purpose in Writing 约翰福音的写作目的
The Gospel according to John is clearly different from the Gospels written by Matthew, Mark and Luke. For example, John does not mention the birth of John or Jesus, Jesus’ early years, his baptism and temptation. John also does not include the stories of the transfiguration, the Lord’s Supper, Gethsemane, and Christ’s ascension. Furthermore, John does not describe Jesus’ healing of people who were demon possessed and records none of the Lord’s parables. On the other hand, John includes several of Jesus’ long sermons. While the other Gospel writers give many stories about Jesus’ Galilean ministry, John writes mostly about Jesus’ time in Jerusalem and Judaea.
这部福音书因为作者是约翰所以很显然不同于马太，马可和路加所写的福音书。比如，约翰没有提到施洗约翰和耶稣的出生，耶稣的早年生活，他的受洗和受试探。约翰福音中也没有写登山变像，主的晚餐，客西马尼园和耶稣升天。此外，约翰没有描写耶稣医治被污鬼附着的人，也没有记录主耶稣的任何比喻。另一方面，约翰福音中包括了耶稣的一些大段讲道。其他福音书的作者写了很多耶稣在加利利地区的传道行程，约翰主要写的是耶稣在耶路撒冷和犹太地区的所作的事。
How can we explain this? Since Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written many years before, John may well have been familiar with them. Moved by the Holy Spirit he noticed a lack of information on Jesus’ early ministry and made a point of writing about those months (1:19-3:36). Meanwhile he did not feel it necessary to retell the details of Jesus’ birth, baptism, temptations, and so on, because they had already been written in the other Gospels.
我们怎么解释这件事？因为马太福音，马可福音和路加福音是早于约翰福音很多年前写的，约翰可能对这些福音书都非常熟悉。被圣灵感动使他注意到其他福音书缺少耶稣早期传道形成的信息，因此打算一定要将这几个月的事情写下来（1:19-3:36）。同时他认为没有必要重复描写耶稣出生，受洗，受试探等细节，因为这些在其他的福音书中都已经被写过了。
Also, when John wrote this book he may have wanted to correct mistaken ideas that some people had about Jesus. Some people thought too much about John the Baptist (Acts 19:1-7), so John makes it clear that he was only the forerunner of the Messiah (1:8, 19-23; 3:28-30). Others thought that Jesus was not equal to God but was a power that had gone out from God and was distant from him. So John shares the truth that Jesus was true God already at the beginning of his Gospel (1:1-3,14).
并且，当约翰在写这部福音书的时候，他可能希望纠正一些人对耶稣的错误看法。一些人过多的关注施洗约翰（使徒行传19:1-7），因此约翰清楚地说明他只是弥赛亚的先驱（1:8，19-23；3:28-30）。另一些人认为耶稣不等同于上帝而是从上帝所出的一股力量并远离耶稣。因此约翰在他的福音一开始就告诉他们真理是耶稣真的是上帝（1:1-3,14）。
Finally, for those who felt that Jesus was only a man who became possessed by some “heavenly Christ” from the time of his baptism until before his death, John presents the facts: “The Word became flesh” (1:14) and the wounds which Thomas touched belonged to the Lord God (20:27-28). However, although John wished to put an end to these false teachings of his time, this was clearly not his main purpose in writing. John wished to strengthen the Christians for life everlasting. He wrote: Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name (20:30-31).
最后，对于一些人认为耶稣从受洗到离世都是被一些“天上的基督”驱使，约翰呈现了这些的事实:“道成了肉身”（1:14）以及多马摸到了主耶稣的钉痕（20:27-28）。然而，虽然在那时约翰希望终止人们的一些错误教导，但很显然这不是他写这部福音的主要目的。约翰希望基督徒为了永生能得以坚固。他写道:耶稣在门徒面前另外行了许多神迹，没有记在这书上。但记这些事，要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是神的儿子，并且叫你们信了他，就可以因他的名得生命（20:30-31）。

Summary
概述
Theme: “The Word Became Flesh”
主题:“道成了肉身”
John’s Gospel shows that the Savior was true man (2:15; 4:6, 31; 6:5,20; 11:33,35,38) as well as true God (6:33-38; 8:58; 17:5). These two natures of Christ are mentioned in this statement, “The Word became flesh and lived for a while among us”(1:14). John made it clear that a Christian must believe in the God/ Man Christ Jesus in order to be saved.
约翰的福音书向我们说明了救主是真的人（2:15；4:6，31；6:5，20；11:33，35，38）也是真的神（6:33-38；8:58；17:5）。基督的这两个属性在以下的陈述中都提到了，“道成了肉身，住在我们中间”（1:14）。约翰明确地告诉我们基督徒为了的拯救必须相信既是神也是人的基督耶稣。
1. Summary (1:1-18)
概述（1:1-18）
In the first 18 verses John tells what the rest of the book is about. Here he gives the great subjects about which he will be writing. The Word, the second person of the Trinity, has always existed. He is God who has come into the world as a human. Not John but Jesus is the light of the world. Most people in the world have not accepted the Savior, but those who believe in him become the children of God. Jesus is equal to the Father, and we know the Father through Jesus his Son.
在第一章的前18节约翰概括了这部书其他部分的内容。在此他提出了关于他将要写的内容的重要主题。道，三位一体中的另一位一直存在。他是神成为人来到世上。不是施洗约翰而是耶稣是这世上的光。世上大多数人都不承认救主耶稣，但是那些相信他的人成为神的儿女。耶稣等同于父神，而且我们了解父神藉着耶稣他的儿子向我们显现。
2. Jesus Reveals Himself to the Jews (1:19-4:54)
耶稣向犹太人显明自己（1:19-4:54）
As we have said, John does not mention the events of Christ’s early years. John moves immediately to the time when Jesus began his public ministry. John the Baptist only said he was the forerunner (1:19-28). But when John baptized Jesus, he recognized that Jesus was the Son of God (1:29-34), and he said that publicly.
正如我们已经说过的，约翰没有提到基督早年的事情。约翰直接从耶稣开始他公开传道的行程开始写。施洗约翰只说了他是先驱（1:19-28）。但是当约翰为耶稣施洗，他意识到耶稣是神的儿子（1:29-34），并且向众人做见证。
Soon Jesus picked several disciples (1:35-51). Like John the Baptist, they too came to recognize Jesus as the Son of God.
不久耶稣就拣选了几个门徒（1:35-51）。就像施洗约翰一样，他们也认识到就是神的儿子。
Then there was the day when Jesus first showed his glory and power. He turned water into wine at a wedding in Cana (2:1-11).
接着有一天耶稣第一次显示他的荣耀和力量。他在参加迦拿的一个婚礼时将水变为了酒（2:1-11）。
John now tells various stories from Jesus’ life which the other Gospel writers did not mention. Jesus went south to Jerusalem and presented himself in the temple. It was his Father’s house and he felt he must purify it (2:12-25). By now many people were beginning to believe in Jesus (2:23). Even a Pharisee by the name of Nicodemus was brought to faith through the teaching of Jesus (3:1-21). Here John records some of the most wonderful words Jesus ever spoke, John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
约翰讲述了别的福音书作者没有提到的一些在耶稣生活中发生的各样事情。耶稣向南走来到耶路撒冷并出现在圣殿里。这是他父的房子，他感到他应该使它洁净（2:12-25）。到这时，很多人开始相信耶稣（2:23）。耶稣的教导甚至带给了一个名叫尼哥德慕的法利赛人信心（3:1-21）。在此，约翰记录了一些耶稣说的最美好的语言，约翰福音3:16，“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”
The 8 months of Jesus’ early Judean ministry are briefly described in 3:22-36. While John the Baptist and Jesus worked in the same area at the same time, John made it clear that Jesus, not he himself, was the Son of God.
3:22-36大致描述了耶稣早期在犹太传道8个月。当施洗约翰和耶稣同时在同一地区同工时，施洗约翰明确地表示耶稣，而不是约翰自己，是神的儿子。
The point John the disciple keeps making in these first chapters of his book is that Jesus revealed himself as the Savior to the people of Palestine. The message of Jesus spread throughout Samaria because of a talk Jesus had with a woman by a well (4:1-42). Further north in Galilee Jesus gave yet another sign of his almighty power by healing a nobleman’s son (4:46-54).
重点是门徒约翰在他的福音书前几章都在记录耶稣向巴勒斯坦地区的人们显明自己。因为耶稣与一个妇人在井边的一段对话（4:1-42），耶稣的信息传遍撒玛利亚。在北边更远的地方加利利，耶稣通过治好大臣的儿子再一次展现了他的大能（4:46-54）。
3. Jesus is Rejected by the Jews (5:1-12:50)
耶稣被犹太人弃绝（5:1-12:50）
John stated in his introduction, “He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to those who were his own, but his own did not receive him”(1:10-11). The next eight chapters show the truth of this statement.
约翰在引言中陈述到，“他在世界，世界也是藉着他造的，世界却不认识他。他到自己的地方来，自己的人倒不接待他”（1:10-11）。在接下去的八章揭示了这段陈述的真理。
One Sabbath day in Jerusalem Jesus showed himself to be the Son of God by healing a paralyzed man. Instead of worshiping Jesus the Jews accused him of breaking the Sabbath law (5:1-16).
在耶路撒冷的一个安息日，耶稣通过治好一个瘫子显明他是神的儿子。犹太人不敬拜耶稣，反而控告他破坏安息日的律法（5:1-16）。
In one of the long sermons which only John records Jesus defends himself (5:17-47). Jesus is the Son of God, as the Father and John the Baptist have revealed. “He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him”(5:23).
只在约翰福音中出现的大段讲道中一个记录了耶稣为自己分诉（5:17-47）。耶稣是神的儿子，正如父神和施洗约翰已经揭示的一样。“不尊敬子的，就是不尊敬差子来的父”（5:23）。
When Jesus fed the 5000 people, it started a new part of his ministry (6:1-13). The Jews began to look at Jesus not as the Savior from sins but as a king who would supply their daily needs, such as food (6:14-15).
当耶稣给五千人吃饱时，他传道行程的一个新的部分由此开始（6:1-13）。犹太人不是把耶稣看为救我们脱离罪的救主，而是把他看作王能为我们提供日常必需品，如食物（6:14-15）。
Wherever Jesus went crowds followed (6:16-25), and the Lord tried to teach them about his true mission. In the “Bread of Life” sermon Jesus told the people that they needed him, not his miracles, to get eternal life (6:26-59). But most of the people did not believe this. “From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him”(6:66). Simon Peter, however, knew what was important about Jesus (6:60-71).
无论耶稣到哪里都有众人跟随（6:16-25），并且主耶稣试图教导他们他真正的使命是什么。在“生命之粮”的讲道中，耶稣告诉人们他们需要他，不是因他的神迹而是为了获得永生（6:26-59）。但是大部分人不相信这一点。“从此，他门徒中多有退去的，不再和他同行”。尽管西门彼得知道耶稣来的最重要目的是什么（6:60-71）。
More and more people turned against Jesus. Plans were made to kill him (7:1). His own brothers refused to believe him (7:5). When Jesus spoke in the temple, the Jews accused him of being controlled by a demon (7:20).
越来越多的人转而反对耶稣。并且计划要杀害他（7:1）。他自己的弟兄拒绝相信他（7:5）。当耶稣在圣殿里教训人时，犹太人控告他被鬼附着了（7:20）。
Is Jesus really the promised Savior? That was the question being asked (7:25-27). Jesus said yes. When the Jewish leaders heard this, they tried to arrest him (7:28-53).
耶稣真的是应许的救主吗？这是被问到的问题（7:25-27）。耶稣回答是。当犹太领袖们听到这个，他们试图捉拿他（7:28-53）。
But John does more than write down what Jesus did and said. He also explains it for his readers. This is seen in verses such as 7:39.
但是除了记录耶稣所说的话和做的事以外，约翰还写了其他内容。他还向他的读者解释了耶稣所说的话和所做的事。这一点可以从一些句子中看到，如7:39。
The Pharisees and teachers of the law refused to believe that Jesus was the Messiah. They tried to make the crowd angry at Jesus by asking him how a woman caught in adultery should be punished. Jesus showed that he had love for sinners and that sinful men could not trap him (8:1-11).
法利赛人和文士们拒绝相信耶稣是弥赛亚。他们试图通过问耶稣一个行淫时被捉拿的妇人该受到怎样的惩罚这样的问题使众人愤怒。耶稣表明了他对有罪的人的爱，因此那些罪恶的人没能陷害他(8:1-11)。
The rest of chapter 8 (vv.12-59) shows the Jews still rejecting Jesus. They also show Jesus’ patience and his desire to teach them the truth.
第八章的其他部分（12-59节）告诉我们了犹太人仍然拒绝耶稣。这些句子还让我们看到了耶稣的耐心和他希望教导真理他们愿望。
The Jewish leaders thought that Jesus could do no good. Even when he healed a blind man, they only showed their unbelief (9:1-41). Yet, Jesus the Good Shepherd opens his arms to all who believe (10:1-21).
犹太领袖们认为耶稣对他们来说没有益处。甚至当耶稣治好了一个瞎眼的人之后，他们仍不相信他（9:1-41）。然而，耶稣这位好牧人向所有信他的人张开双臂（10:1-21）。
The name Lazarus means “God is help.” In the story of Jesus’ raising Lazarus from the dead (11:1-44) John shows how the Lord not only helped the dead man but how he helped the man’s family as well. Above all Jesus showed what he meant in the saying, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies”(11:25-26).
拉撒路这个名字的意思是“神是帮助”。在耶稣使拉撒路从死里复活的故事中（11:1-44）约翰不仅告诉我们了主耶稣怎样帮助已死的人还帮助了那个人的家人。最重要的是耶稣告诉我们了他说，“复活在我，生命也在我！信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活”（11:25-26）是什么意思。
The Jewish leaders still refused to believe that Jesus was the Messiah, their Savior. Instead, they planned to kill him (11:45-12:11).
犹太领袖们仍然拒绝相信耶稣是弥赛亚，他们的救主。相反的，他们计划杀害他（11:45-12:11）。
The miracle of raising Lazarus brought joy to many people on Palm Sunday (12:12-18). This made the Pharisees even more angry (12:19).
使拉撒路复活的神迹为许多人在棕枝主日带来了喜悦（12:12-18）。这使得法利赛人更生气了（12:19）。
John shows clearly that Jesus’ death was no accident. Jesus came to earth to suffer and die for the sins of all people. Jesus taught this throughout his ministry and here before his arrest (12:20-36). But the Jews continued in their unbelief (12:37-50).
约翰很明确地告诉我们耶稣的死不是偶然的。耶稣来到世上受苦并为所有人的罪而死。并通过他的传道和在被捕之前的时间教导众人这些。但是犹太人还是不信（12:37-50）。
4. Jesus Reveals Himself to His Disciples (13:1-17:26)
耶稣向他的门徒们显明自己（13:1-17:26）
In the next 5 chapters John records many of the talks Jesus had with his disciples. Jesus washed the feet of the disciples in order to teach them humility (13:1-17). Jesus showed that he is all-knowing by predicting Judas’ betrayal (13:18-30) and Peter’s denial (13:31-38).
在接下去的五章中约翰记录了很多耶稣和他门徒们的谈话。耶稣为门徒们洗脚是为了教导他们谦卑（13:1-17）。耶稣通过预言犹大的背叛（13:18-30）和彼得的不认主（13:31-38）告诉我们他是无所不知的。
John was the disciple that Jesus especially loved. However, the next several sermons show that Jesus loved all his disciples. He comforted them with the promise of heaven (14:1-4). He could do this because he was united with God the Father (14:5-14). The Lord promised to send the Holy Spirit to be with them when he went away (14:15-31). He begs them to be united with him and therefore also with the Father (15:1-17).
约翰是耶稣特别喜爱的门徒。然而，接下去的几次讲道告诉我们了耶稣爱他所有的门徒。他以天堂的应许安慰他们（14:1-4）。他能给他们应许是因为他和天父上帝是一体的（14:5-14）。主耶稣应许赐圣灵予他们当他们离开时（14:15-31）。他请求他们常在他里面，因此也常在父里面（15:1-17）。
Jesus did not pretend that life would be easy for the disciples. The world would hate them just as it did Jesus (15:18-16:4). Soon the Holy Spirit would help the disciples understand about Jesus’ death, resurrection and going back to heaven (16:5-16). Later Jesus would appear and turn all their sadness into joy (16:17-33).
耶稣没有谎称门徒们的生活会容易。世人会恨他们正如他们恨耶稣一样（15:18-16:4）。不久，圣灵会帮助门徒们理解耶稣的死，复活和升天（16:5-16）。之后耶稣会显现并将所有的悲伤转变成喜悦（16:17-33）。
In chapter 17 Jesus speaks a long prayer. It is arranged in 3 parts. Jesus first prays for himself (17:1-5). Then he widens his prayer to include his disciples (17:6-19). Finally, he prays for all believers (17:20-26).
在十七章，耶稣说了很长的祷告。这个祷告分为三部分。耶稣先为他自己祷告（17:1-5）。然后他将祷告扩大到他的门徒们（17:6-19）。最后，他为所有信他的人祷告（17:20-26）。
5. Jesus Shows His Love in His Death and Resurrection (18:1-20:31)
耶稣用他的死和复活表明他的爱（18:1-20:31）
The story now suddenly changes. John leads his readers through the low points and high points of Jesus’ sufferings and death. Jesus could have kept from being arrested in the garden, but he chose not to (18:1-11). Jesus was mocked at a Jewish trial while his own close disciple, Peter, denied him (18:12-27). The Lord was put on trial before the Roman governor Pilate. This cowardly official sent Jesus to die just because the Jewish leaders wanted him to (18:28-19:16).
此时故事突然发生转变。约翰带领他的读者经历耶稣受难和离世的起起落落。耶稣本可以避免被捕，但他没有选择逃避（18:1-11）。耶稣在被犹太人审问时受到嘲讽，同时，他最亲近的门徒，彼得，不认他（18:12-27）。主耶稣被带到罗马总督彼拉多面前受审。这个胆小的官员由于犹太领袖们希望耶稣死就判了他死罪（18:28-19:16）。
Then Jesus was crucified (19:16-37). John here records a story which was near and dear to his heart. While in the midst of his suffering on the cross Jesus asked John to take care of his own mother Mary.
之后耶稣被钉十字架（19:16-37）。约翰在此记录的一件事是他极为珍视的。当耶稣在十字架上受苦时，他要约翰照顾他的母亲马利亚。
Jesus then died. John, who saw this with his own eyes, writes that the Lord “gave up his spirit”(19:30). A Roman soldier stuck a spear in Jesus’ side and blood and water came out (19:34). Finally his body was prepared for burial and was laid in a tomb (19:38-42).
然后耶稣离世。约翰，亲眼目睹这一切，写下主耶稣“将灵魂交付神”（19:30）。一个罗马士兵拿枪扎耶稣的肋旁，随即有血和水流出来（19:34）。最后耶稣的身体预备好被埋葬就被安放在坟墓里（19:38-42）。
Peace came to the believers on Easter Sunday. Jesus, the “Resurrection and the Life”, (11:25) rose from the dead (20:1-9). He showed himself to Mary Magdalene and to the disciples, including “doubting Thomas”(20:10-27). Thomas thenconfessed that Jesus was the Lord God (20:28). Jesus spoke to all future Christians when he said, “blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (20:29). Through the message of Jesus Christ we have faith and life (20:30-31).
平安在复活节星期天降临到信徒们那里。耶稣，“复活和生命”，（11:25）从死里复活（20:1-9）。他向抹大拉的马利亚和门徒们，包括“多疑的多马”显现（20:10-27）。之后多马承认耶稣是主，是神（20:28）。当耶稣说，“那没有看见就信的有福了”（20:29）是对将来所有基督徒说的。通过耶稣基督的信息，我们得到信心和生命（20:30-31）。
6. Jesus Continues to Show His Love (21:1-25)
耶稣继续显示他的爱（21:1-25）
Jesus, so filled with love before his death, was just as loving after his resurrection. The Lord appeared to the disciples and Peter near the spot where he had first met them (21:1-14). Then he turned to Peter, and made it clear that he still wanted him as one of his workers (21:15-23).
耶稣，在他离世前仍充满爱，和他复活之后一样。主耶稣在他第一次见门徒们的地方向他们显现（21:1-14）。然后他转向彼得，使彼得明白他仍希望彼得是他的事工之一（21:15-23）。
John ends his Gospel by reminding his readers one more time that what he wrote actually happened. John had seen it all with his own eyes (21:24-25).
约翰以再一次提醒他的读者他所写的事情确实发生了来结束他的福音书。约翰亲眼看到了这一切（21:24-25）。
