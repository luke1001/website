第五章：狱中的书信：以弗所书，腓立比书和歌罗西书
Introduction
引言
Paul wrote to the believers in Philippi, “I have learned to be content whatever the situation” (Phil 4:11). He was talking about the fact that he was under house arrest in Rome. Paul could receive visitors, but he was not free to leave and begin another mission trip. During this time, Paul learned as much as he could about the churches he had established and kept contact by writing letters to them. Three of those letters have been preserved in the Holy Bible: Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.
保罗写信给腓力比的信徒说，“无论在什么景况都可以知足”（4:11）。他谈论的是他被软禁的事实。保罗可以接待拜访他的人，但是他不能自由离开或开始另一次传道行程。在这段时间里，保罗尽可能多地了解到关于他建立的教会的消息并通过书信和他们保持联系。其中的三封保留在圣经中:以弗所书，腓立比书和歌罗西书。
Ephesians
以弗所书
The Writer
作者
Paul, the “apostle of Christ Jesus”(1:1) wrote this letter. At the time he was a prisoner in Rome (3:1;4:1; 6:20). Since the letters to the Colossians and Ephesians are so similar, with more than 55 identical verses, it is highly likely that Paul wrote them at the same time. The date was about A.D. 61. Tychicus, mentioned in the last chapter (6:21), carried the letter from Paul to the church. He also delivered the letters written to Philemon and the Colossians (Col. 4:7-9).
保罗，“基督耶稣的使徒”（1:1）写了这封信。那时他在罗马的监牢中（3:1；4:1；6:20）。因为给歌罗西人和以弗所人的书信非常相似，通过超过55句相同的章节可以看出保罗很可能在同一时期写了这两封信。年份大约是公元61年。推基古，在信中的最后一章被提及（6:21），将保罗的信带到教会。他还将写给腓利门人和歌罗西人的信带给他们（歌罗西书4:7-9）。
Paul’s Purpose in Writing
保罗的写作目的
First let us talk about the people to whom this letter was written. Our English Bibles usually say “to the saints in Ephesus”(1:1). However, several things indicate that Paul meant this letter for a different or larger audience:
首先我们来谈一下这封信是写给谁的。我们的英文圣经常说“写信给在以弗所的圣徒”（1:1）。然而几件事显示出保罗这封信是针对不同的或者说是更多的读者的:
1. The phrase “to the saints in Ephesus” (1:1) is not found in the oldest Greek manuscripts of this letter.
在这封信最早的希腊语手稿中却找不到“写信给在以弗所的圣徒”一词（1:1）。
2. Paul had worked in Ephesus for 3 years. He knew the Christians personally and had brought many of them to faith by his preaching of the Gospel. Yet in the letter to the Ephesians, Paul indicates that he has only “heard” of these believers (1:15-16;3:2-3). He does not include any personal greetings (compare Col. 4:15-17). He also indicates that his preaching did not lead to their conversion (1:13; 4:20-21).
保罗在以弗所做了3年的事工。他本人非常了解那里的基督徒并通过传讲福音让他们许多人都信了神的道。然而在这封给以弗所人的信中，保罗表明他只是“听见”这些人信了神的道（1:15-16；3:2-3）。他没有向任何个人问安（比较歌罗西书4:15-17）。他还指出并不是他的传道使他们有了信心（1:13；4:20-21）。
To whom, then, did Paul write this letter? Because of its general nature it seems that Paul wrote this letter for all the churches in Asia Minor (Ephesus, Laodicea, Hierapolis, etc.). Paul had not preached in Laodicea or Hierapolis (Col. 4:12-13). Why, then, did Paul write to them? Although the apostle was in Rome, he had heard about problems in the Christian churches of Asia Minor. He knew that false teachers inside the church and pagan religion from outside threatened the believers. The Jewish Christians were tempted to return to their Jewish beliefs and ways (see Galatians). The Gentile believers were also possible victims of frustrations and temptations. Therefore in this letter Paul brings joy to believing hearts by reminding his readers of the blessings which God has given them. He shows that they are now a new people and, therefore, should live according to God’s will.
但是这封信是保罗写给谁的呢？因为这封信的特点使保罗的这封信看起来是写给在小亚西亚所有教会（以弗所，老底嘉，希拉波立等等）的。保罗没有在老底嘉和希拉波立传过道（歌罗西书4:12-13）。但是为什么保罗写给他们呢？尽管这位使徒在罗马，他仍听到了小亚西亚基督教会中的问题。他知道了在教会中有假文士并且外部外邦人的宗教威胁着信徒们。犹太人基督徒试图转回到他们以前的信仰和方式（参见加拉太书）外邦的信徒们有可能也是这个挫折和试探的受害者。因此在这封信中，保罗通过提醒他的读者神将祝福赐给他们，使那些信神的人得到喜乐。他是他们知道他们现在是全新的人了，因此应该按照神的意愿生活。

Summary
概要
Theme: “Citizens with God’s People and Members of God’s Household”
主题:“与圣徒同国，是神家里的人了”
Paul Kretzmann wrote that the central idea of this letter was the “holy Christian Church, the communion of saints.” In Ephesians Paul shows that the Jewish and Gentile believers are “fellow citizens with God’s people and members of God’s Household” (2:19).
保罗Kretzmann写出了这封信的核心是“圣教会，圣徒相通”。在以弗所书中，保罗告诉我们犹太的和外邦的信徒都是“与圣徒同国，是神家里的人”（2:19）。
1. Introduction (1:1-2)
引言（1:1-2）
Paul has a normal introduction in this letter. He names himself and tells who he is writing to. He then gives a short blessing. However, he also mentions the main subject of the letter. He is talking to “the saints”(those set apart by and for God), “the faithful” who are one in Christ Jesus.
保罗在这封信的引言没有特别之处。他提到了他自己的名字并指出了这封信写给谁。之后他写了一下段祝福。然而他还提到了这封信的主体。他是在对“圣徒们”（那些被神分别出来并做神所吩咐的事的人）说，“信的人”就是在基督耶稣里了。
2. Members in God’s Household (1:3-3:21)
神家里的人（1:3-3:21）
The main part of this letter begins with a look at membership in the holy Christian Church as God sees it (1:3-23). God gives salvation. God the Father has chosen to save sinners through the life and death of his Son, Jesus Christ (1:3-10). The Holy Spirit works through the Gospel to bring man to faith and assures the believer of his salvation. Since salvation is a free gift of God, all glory for this should go to him (1:6,12,14). Paul thanks God when he remembers his readers, for they are an example and part of the whole group of believers over whom the Savior rules (1:15-23).
这封信的主体部分以神如何看待圣教会中的人作为开始（1:3-23）。神赐予救恩。父神拣选并通过他独生子耶稣基督的生和死拯救了罪人（1:3-10）。圣灵通过福音做工带给人信心并使信的人确信他的救恩。因为救恩是神赐给的礼物，所有荣耀都归给他（1:6，12，14）。当保罗想到他的读者时他很感恩，因为他们是一个榜样而且是救主掌权的所有信徒中的一部分（1:15-23）。
Now Paul looks at membership in God’s family as mankind sees it (2:1-22). People who are undeserving and spiritually dead sinners receive salvation through faith in Jesus. They are made alive by grace, a free gift of God (2:1-10). Jews and Gentiles who believe are made one holy people in the cross of Christ. They have equal access to God the Father and salvation (2:11-22).
保罗从人的角度来说明如何成为神家里的人（2:1-22）。不配的并且灵已死的罪人靠着信耶稣领受救恩。他们靠着恩典，神的恩赐得着生命（2:1-10）。犹太人和外邦人相信在被钉十字架的基督里合一成圣。他们有平等的机会进到天父面前和得到救恩（2:11-22）。
Paul now applies what he has written to himself (3:1-21). God chose not only to save him but to make him a minister as well. Paul is blessed to be able to teach God’s plan for the holy Christian Church (3:1-13). As a pastor, Paul prays that the Spirit may lead his readers to know the love of God which goes beyond the knowledge this world thinks is important (3:14-19).
保罗将他所写的内容和自己联系起来（3:1-21）。神不只拯救了他还使他成为执事。保罗蒙福能为圣基督教会教导神的安排（3:1-13）。作为一位牧师，保罗祷告圣灵能引导他的读者了解神的爱超过世人认为的这世上任何重要的事（3:14-19）。
Finally the apostle ends this part of his letter just as he began it. He gives all glory to God (3:20-21).
最后这位使徒如他在这部分开头写的一样结束了这一部分。他将所有荣耀归给神（3:20-21）。
3. Behavior of God’s People (4:1-6:20)
圣徒的行为（4:1-6:20）
Paul has shown how one becomes a member of the Church. Now he discusses the proper behavior for God’s people. Christians should live together in unity (4:1-6). But this does not mean that every believer is alike. In the church there are different talents and different jobs which all help build up the whole body (4:7-16). Christians are to live as Christians and not behave as Gentile sinners (4:17-24). Out of love for God, believers keep the Ten Commandments. Almost every verse of this part (4:25-5:7) uses one or more of the Commandments to discuss Christian living. Again Paul reminds his readers to live the new life in Christ (5:8-21).
保罗已经讲过了一个人如何成为教会的一员。在这里他讨论的是圣徒的行为。基督徒应该合一（4:1-6）。但是这不意味着每个信徒是一样的。在教会中，不同的恩赐和不同的职分都帮助建立整个身体。（4:7-16）。基督徒要像基督徒一样行事而不要像外邦的罪人一样（4:17-24）。出于对神的爱，信徒们遵行十诫。这一部分几乎每一句话（4:25-5:7）都用了一条或更多的诫命来谈论基督徒的行为。保罗再一次提醒他的读者在基督里如新人一样行事（5:8-21）。
Paul has been speaking to every believer about Christian living. Now he speaks to smaller groups. He describes how wives and husbands (5:22-33), children and parents (6:1-4), slaves and masters (6:5-9) should live together in a God-pleasing way.
保罗一直在向每一位信徒谈论基督徒的行为。在此他对少数人说。他讲述了妻子与丈夫（5:22-33），儿女与父母（6:1-4），奴仆与主人（6:5-9）应以神喜悦的方式生活在一起。
Such Christian living is not easy. Satan fights against it with all his power. With the “full armor of God,” however, the believer can stand firm (6:10-20).
这样的基督徒生活并不容易。撒旦用他所有的力量来与它争战。然而，有了“神的军装”信徒就能站立得稳（6:10-20）。
4. Final Greeting (6:21-24)
最后的问安（6:21-24）
Paul’s letter has presented truths which do not change. Yet his readers are also interested in what was happening at that time within the Christian Church. Tychicus, who is carrying the letter, will tell them all the news (6:21-22). In the letter’s closing words, Paul offers a blessing of God’s free gifts: peace, love, faith, and grace (6:23-24).
保罗的书信呈现了不变的真理。然而他的读者还关心那时的基督教会中发生了什么。推基古带着的这封信将会告诉他们所有的消息（6:21-22）。在信的结尾部分，保罗以神的恩赐:平安、仁爱、信心和恩典祝福他们（6:23-24）。
Philippians
腓立比书
The Writer
作者
The New Testament book known as Philippians begins with the words “Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus” (1:1). However it is quite clear that Paul wrote the book by himself. After this opening greeting, Paul uses the first person singulars “I” and “me.” It was Paul and not Timothy who was in “chains” in Rome (1:12-14; 2:19). Finally, Paul describes himself as a circumcised Jew “of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews . . . a Pharisee,” and former persecutor of the church. All of these words describe Paul, not Timothy.
新约中所说的腓立比书以“基督耶稣的仆人保罗和提摩太”作为开始（1:1）。很明显保罗本人写了这部书。在开始的问候之后，保罗使用了第一人称单数的主语“我”和宾语“我”。这是保罗而不是提摩太在罗马被“捆锁”（1:12-14；2:19）。最后，保罗形容他自己是受割礼的犹太人“便雅悯支派的人，希伯来人所生的希伯来人…一个法利赛人”，并且以前是迫害教会的人。这些词语都描述的是保罗，不是提摩太。
Paul’s Purpose in Writing
保罗的写作目的
Paul had first come to the Macedonian town of Philippi during his second missionary journey. Silas, Timothy and Luke were with him. He shared the message of Jesus Christ with a group of women, and a congregation was begun. However, soon enemies of the Gospel caused problems and Paul and Silas were jailed. After being released they left town, taking Timothy with them (Acts 16:11-40). Luke stayed behind, perhaps to preach and teach.
保罗在他第二次传道行程中第一次来到了腓立比的城镇马其顿。西拉，提摩太和路加和他同行。他和一群妇人们分享了耶稣基督的信息，一个聚会就开始了。然而，不久福音的仇敌就带来了麻烦，保罗和西拉被关进牢里。在被释放后，他们和提摩太一起离开了这个城镇（使徒行传16:11-40）。路加留在那里，可能是为了讲道和教导人。
During the following years Paul and the Philippian congregation stayed in contact, forming a “partnership in the gospel”(1:5). Twice more Paul visited Philippi (Acts 20:2,3-6), and the congregation supported his mission work in Thessalonica (4:16) and Corinth (2 Cor. 11:8-9). The Philippians gave to the collection Paul was gathering for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (2Cor. 8:1-5). Finally, while Paul was in prison in Rome the Philippian Christians sent gifts and a layman, Epaphroditus, to help him.
在接下来的几年中，保罗和腓立比的会众保持着联系，形成了“同心合意地兴旺福音”（1:5）。之后保罗又拜访了腓立比两次（使徒行传20:2，3-6），并且帖撒罗尼迦（4:16）和哥林多（哥林多后书11:8-9）的教会为他的传道行程提供了供给。腓立比人把为耶路撒冷的贫困基督徒募集的捐资交给保罗（哥林多后书8:1-5）。最后，当保罗在罗马的监牢中的时候，腓立比的基督徒给他送去了馈赠并派了一个平信徒，以巴弗提，去帮助他。
Paul had two purposes in writing the Philippians this letter. First he wished to thank them for their partnership with him in spreading the Gospel. Second, he wanted to strengthen their faith in Christ Jesus and encourage them to lead Christian lives.
保罗写这封信给腓立比人有两个目的。第一，他希望感谢他们在兴旺福音这件事上与他的同心合意。第二，他想在基督耶稣里面建立他们的信心并鼓励他们带领基督徒过得胜的生活。
While Epaphroditus was with Paul in Rome he had become very sick. Now he had recovered and was carrying the letter to Philippi (about A.D. 61). Paul asked the congregation to give this wonderful Christian a warm “welcome home” (2:19-30).
当以巴弗提和保罗在罗马时，他病得很严重。这时他已经康复了并且将保罗的信带到了腓立比（大约公元61年）。保罗要求教会给这位极好的基督徒热情的“接待”（2:19-30）。

Summary
概要
Theme: “I Will Continue to Rejoice”
主题:“我还要欢喜”
From beginning to end the letter to the Philippians is filled with joy. The words “I will continue to rejoice”(1:18) describe what was in Paul’s heart. Closer to the end (4:4) Paul invites his readers to share his joy: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice”! The words rejoice, joy, cheer and glad are used 15 times in this short letter.
这封给腓立比人的信从开始到结尾都充满了喜乐。“我还要欢喜”这句话描述了保罗心里的感受。接近结尾处（4:4）保罗邀请他的读者分享他的喜乐:“你们要靠主常常喜乐！我再说，你们要喜乐！”欢喜，喜乐，愉快，高兴这些词在这封短短的信中被用到了15次。
1. Address (1:1-2)
写作对象（1:1-2）
Paul himself and Timothy are the senders of this letter, and the letter is sent to the Christians of Philippi. Then a blessing follows.
保罗自己和提摩太是这封信的发信人，而这封信是写给腓立比的基督徒的。然后紧接着就是祝福。
2. Paul Rejoices in the Spread of the Gospel(1:3-30)
保罗在兴旺福音的事上得喜乐（1:3-30）
Paul begins by thanking God for the Philippians with whom he has enjoyed a “partnership” in spreading the Gospel. Several years earlier the apostle had told the believers in Rome that he was not ashamed of the Gospel (Rom. 1:16). It was clear to Paul that the Christians of Philippi were not ashamed of the message of Jesus Christ either.
保罗开始就写道感谢神让腓立比人与他在兴旺福音这件事上“同心合意”使他得喜乐。几年以前这位使徒就告诉过罗马的信徒们他不以福音为耻（罗马书1:16）。很明显对于保罗来说腓立比的基督徒也不以耶稣基督的信息为耻。
Beginning at verse 12 Paul tells his “partners” that even though he was under arrest in Rome, the Lord was using his time in prison to advance the saving Gospel (1:12-18). Then Paul writes that he is ready for whatever the Lord wishes for him. He would like to begin his life in heaven now. But he knows there is still work for him to do on earth (1:19-26). Whatever the future holds for him, the Philippians should live “in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ” (1:27).
第12节的开头保罗告诉他的“同伴”就算他被囚禁在罗马，主还是在使用保罗在狱中的时间兴旺救赎的福音（1:12-18）。然后保罗写道他准备做任何主希望他做的事情。他愿意从此开始他在天堂的生活。但是他知道他在世上的工作还未完成（1:19-26）。不管将来他发生什么事情，腓立比人应该行事“与基督的福音相称”（1:27）。
3. Paul Rejoices to See Like-minded and Active Believers (2:1-4:9)
保罗因与他意念相同并且积极的信徒而得喜乐（2:1-4:9）
The main part of Paul’s letter urges the Philippians to have unity with one another according to the example of Christ Jesus. Christians should be humble as the Savior was (2:1-12). They should stay away from evil and live a holy life (2:14-18).
保罗这封信的主要部分催促腓立比人照着基督耶稣的样式彼此合一。基督徒应该像救主一样谦卑（2:1-12）。他们应当远离恶的事并过圣洁的生活（2:14-18）。
Furthermore, Christians are servants just as Timothy and Epaphroditus helped Paul with his needs (2:19-30). True believers fight against false and damning teachings and life. Instead, they cling to the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ (3:1-4:1). Christians who have a common confession of faith enjoy true partnership in spreading the Gospel (4:2-3). Finally, Paul tells the believers to fill their hearts and minds with holiness. They should remember what they have learned, and then put their faith into action. In their thoughts and actions they should rejoice in the Lord (4:4-9)!
此外，基督徒是仆人正像提摩太和以巴弗提帮助保罗提供他所需用的（2:19-30）。真正的信徒与错误的和受咒诅的教导和生活斗争。并且他们坚持因信基督而来的公义（3:1-4:1）。有共同信仰告白的基督徒为兴旺福音的事上的真正同心合意感到喜乐（4:2-3）。最后，保罗告诉信徒们以圣洁充满他们的心和思想。他们应当记住他们所学到的，并将他们的信心付诸于行动。在他们的思想和行为上，他们要靠主常常喜乐（4:4-9）!
4. Paul Rejoices in Shared Blessings (4:10-20)
保罗在分享的祝福上得喜乐（4:10-20）
Paul began his letter to the Philippians by talking about their partnership in the Gospel. Now he ends the letter with the same message. He rejoices in the blessings they share.
保罗在写给腓立比人的信一开始就谈到了同心合意地兴旺福音。现在他以同样的信息结束这封信。他在他们分享的祝福里得喜乐。
5. Greeting (4:21-23)
最后的问安（4:21-23）
Paul wants his joy to be shared by all the believers. Those with him also send their Christian greetings, especially those who were members of the Roman emperor’s household (4:22). The very fact that they believe is proof of the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
保罗希望他的喜乐能和所有的信徒们分享。那些和他一起的人也向众圣徒在基督里问安，特别是那些罗马王室中的成员（4:22）。他们信主的这一事实正是耶稣基督福音大能的证明。

The Apostle Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians (1:1;4:18). The letter also speaks of Timothy in the first verse because he was with Paul at the time and he also wished to send his greetings.
使徒保罗写了这封给歌罗西人的信（1:1；4:18）。这封信也在第一句中提到了提摩太，因为在那时他与保罗在一起并且他也希望送出他的问安。
Paul’s purpose in Writing
保罗的写作目的
The Christian Church in Colossae was started by a man of that city named Epaphras (1:7). He also shared the message of salvation with people in nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis (4:12-13). While it is possible that Epaphras was converted by Paul’s preaching (Acts 19:10), it seems that Paul never visited Colossae (1:4; 2:1).
在歌罗西的基督教会是被那城里一个叫以巴弗的人兴起的（1:7）。他还与附近的老底嘉和希拉波立的众人分享了救恩的信息（4:12-13）。有可能以巴弗是因保罗的讲道信了神的道（使徒行传19:10），似乎保罗从没有拜访过歌罗西（1:4；2:1）。
When he wrote the letter Paul was still under house arrest in Rome. He was able to visit with friends and co-workers (4:7-14). Epaphras had gone from Colossae to Rome to be with Paul (Philemon 23). He also wanted to get advice on how to deal with various problems which had arisen in his home congregation.
当保罗写这封信的时候他仍在罗马被软禁。他能接待来拜访他的朋友和同工们（4:7-14）。以巴弗已经从歌罗西来到罗马与保罗在一起（腓利门书23）。他也希望得到关于如何处理在他家乡的教会中出现的各种问题的建议。
False religious ideas of the Jews and the Greeks were causing trouble in Colossae. Some people taught that Christians must continue to obey all the Jewish laws and regulations (2:11, 16-17). Human philosophies were being followed by others (2:8). The importance and purpose of angels were not clearly understood by the congregation (1:16). Some were trying to gain favor with God by living without certain foods and other things (2:20-23). Finally, certain church members thought the church was a club only for a few nice people (1:20-28).
犹太人和希腊人错误的信仰观点在歌罗西引起了事端。一些人教导基督徒必须继续遵行所有犹太的律法和规条（2:11，16-17）。人的理学还在被其他人所使用（2:8）。会众不能很明确地理解天使存在的重要性和目的（1:16）。一些人还在试图通过不吃特定的食物或不做某些事情来获得神的喜爱（2:20-23）。最后，某些教会的成员认为教会仅仅是少数善良人的聚会（1:20-28）。
The Letter to the Colossians is a warm and friendly letter. Yet it speaks the truth boldly. Paul makes clear what the false teachings were being taught at Colossae and then what the true message of Jesus Christ is.
给歌罗西人的信是一封热心友好的信。然而它放胆说出了真理。保罗明确指出了什么是正在哥林多教给众人的错误教导并告诉他们什么是耶稣基督的真正信息。
Paul wrote this letter at about the same time as the one to the Ephesians (A.D.61). Tychicus was traveling from Rome to Asia Minor and carried this letter with him (4:7; Eph. 6:21).
保罗大概在写给以弗所人的信的同一时间写了这封信（公元61年）。推基古从罗马来到小亚西亚并带着保罗的书信（4:7；以弗所书6:21）。

Summary
概要
Theme: May God “Fill You with the Knowledge of His Will”
主题: 愿神“让你们满心知道神的旨意”
Paul states the main point and purpose of this letter in the first chapter. He says: “We have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding . . . in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord . . . may please him . . . bearing fruit . . . growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened . . . so that you may have great endurance and patience . . . [and ultimately] to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light” (1:9-12). In the rest of the letter Paul shares with the Colossians the facts they need to know about Jesus in order to do his will.
保罗在这封信的第一章就陈述了这个重点和写作目的。他说:“我们为你们不住地祷告祈求，愿你们在一切属灵的智慧悟性上，满心知道神的旨意…好叫你们行事为人对得起主…蒙他喜悦…结果子…渐渐地多知道神，力上加力…好叫你们凡事忍耐宽容…(并最终)与众圣徒在光明中同得基业”（1:9-12）。在信的其他部分，保罗和歌罗西人分享了他们需要知道的关于耶稣的事实好叫他们按耶稣的旨意行事。
1. Address and Introduction (1:1-14)
写作对象和引言（1:1-14）
Paul and Timothy greet the believers in Colossae. Then Paul begins the letter by praising them and thanking God for the faith and love they have shown (1:3-8). Paul then tells the purpose and content of the letter (1:9-14).
保罗和提摩太向歌罗西的信徒们问安。之后保罗以赞美他们和感谢神让他们显出信心和爱心开始了这封信（1:3-8）。保罗还说出了这封信的写作目的和内容（1:9-14）。
2. The True Gospel of Jesus Christ (1:15-23)
耶稣基督的真正福音（1:15-23）
Before the Colossians can do what the Lord wishes them to do they must know Jesus Christ. Jesus is the eternal God, the image of his invisible Father. All things, including angels, were made by him (1:15-17). He is the head of the church and the only one who can restore peace between sinful man and God. Jesus has done this by dying on the cross in payment for mankind’s sins. Those who believe in this work of Jesus are saved (1:18-23).
在歌罗西人能做主希望他们所做的事之前他们必须先认识耶稣基督。耶稣是永恒的神，是未可见的父神的形象。所有的事，包括天使，都是被他所造（1:15-17）。他是教会的头并且只有他能使有罪性的人与神和好。耶稣通过他在十字架上的死赎了人的罪。那些信他所做的人就能得救赎（1:18-23）。
3. The Fruits of the Pure Gospel (1:24-4:6)
纯净的福音所结的果子（1:24-4:6）
After describing who Jesus Christ was and what his mission was, Paul now tells how the Gospel produces good deeds in the life of a Christian. Christians share the saving Word with others, with all others (1:24-2:5). The church is not a club for a few nice people. Like Paul, many Christians will go through suffering to help spread the Gospel.
在描述了谁是耶稣基督以及他的任务是什么之后，保罗开始告诉众人福音怎样在基督徒生命中结出善行的果子。基督徒与所有其他人分享救恩的道（1:24-2:5）。教会不是少数善良人的聚会。就像保罗一样，许多基督徒会为了帮助传福音而经历苦难。
When speaking of the second article of the Apostles’ Creed our Lutheran Catechism teaches that Jesus has redeemed us (bought us back) from sin, death, and the power of the devil. Paul teaches these truths to the Colossians (2:9-15). They have been set free by the death and resurrection of Jesus. Therefore, they should not once again become slaves to human philosophies and religious laws (2:6-8, 16-20).
当谈到使徒信经的第二点时，我们的路德小道理教导的是耶稣从罪，死和恶的力量中把我们赎回来（把我们买回来）。保罗教导歌罗西人这些真理（2:9-15）。他们靠着耶稣的死和复活使我们得释放。因此，他们不应该在成为人类理学和宗教律法的奴仆（2:6-8，16-20）。
Through Christ the Colossians can and must stay away from evil (3:1-11) and should live Christian lives (3:12-17). The teaching by which they should guide their lives is this: “whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (3:17). This can only be done with the help of the Word of Christ living in the Christian (3:16). That same Word also tells Christians how to treat one another in their human relationships (3:18-4:6).
靠着基督歌罗西人可以也必须远离恶（3:1-11）并过基督的生活（3:12-17）。应该用来他们引导他们生活的教导是:“无论做什么，或说话，或行事，都要奉主耶稣的名，藉着他感谢父神”（3:17）。做到这一点只能靠着在基督徒里的基督的道的帮助（3:16）。同样的道也告诉基督徒们在人的关系中如何对待他人（3:18-4:6）。
4. Final Greeting (4:7-18)
最后的问安（4:7-18）
In the main part of this letter Paul has taught, among other things, the importance of unity and prayer. He reminds the Christians of this again in his final greeting (4:7-18).
在这封信的主要部分，保罗已经教导了在所有事情中，合一和祷告的重要性。他在最后的问安中再一次提醒基督徒们这一点（4:7-18）。
