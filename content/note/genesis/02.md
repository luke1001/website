### Verses 1-3-- 1-3节

1) Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 2) By the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all His work. 3) And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the work of creating that He had done.

1）天地万物都造齐了。2）到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工，安息了。3）神赐福给第七日，定为圣日，因为在这日神歇了他一切创造的工，就安息了。

1. Why did God rest or refrain from continuing His creative work on the seventh day? (verses 1-2)

1. 为什么神在第七日歇了他的一切创造之工？（1-2节）

2. In verse 3, we learn that God did do something on the seventh day. He began something that He intended to be a source of blessing for all people for all time. He gave a promise of blessed rest. We are not to confuse His action on the seventh day with His centuries-later establishment of a Sabbath Law observance for the people of Israel. God explains this seventh-day blessing for us in Hebrews 4:1-11. The rest God promises is not a physical rest, but the spiritual and eternal rest of salvation which people enter now through faith in the Good News of Jesus Christ. This rest is enjoyed in part here on earth and will be enjoyed in completely and perfectly in heaven. (See Isaiah 57:2 and Revelation 14:13)

2.通过第三节我们看到神在第七日也做了一件事。他设立了一种万民蒙福的源头。他应许蒙福的安息。我们不要把神在第七日所做的跟几百年之后他给以色列民设立的安息日相混淆。神在希伯来书4:1-11节告诉了我们这第七日带来的祝福。神在这里应许的安息不是身体的安息，而是因着相信耶稣基督福音而进入的属灵的和永恒的得救的安息。在地上人可以浅尝安息之味，只有将来到天上才能得享完全的安息。（参看赛57:2和启14:13）

### Verse 4a-- 4a节

4a) This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. 4a）创造天地的来历，

3. After God gave us an eloquent overview of creation in Genesis 1:1-2:3, He moves to a new section of Genesis. This will be the first of ten major stories of development that He tells us about in the Book of Genesis. Here God will tell us what would happen next to His young creation.

3. 在创世纪1:1-2:3神准确概括的告诉了我们创造的过程，接下来是创世纪的另外一个阶段。这部分包括神在创世纪告诉我们的十大重要事件之一。在这里神告诉我们发生在新造之物身上的事情。

### Verses 4b-7-- 4b-7节

4b) When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens - 5) and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not yet sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, 6) but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground - 7) the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

4b）在耶和华神造天地的日子，乃是这样。5）野地还没有草木，田间的菜蔬还没有长起来，因为耶和华神还没有降雨在地上，也没有人耕地。6）但有雾气从地上腾，滋润遍地。7) 耶和华神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人，名叫亚当。

4. We note that God now uses the name "Lord" (Yahweh in Hebrew) to describe Himself. He added it to the name God (Elohim in Hebrew) that He had already introduced in Genesis 1. The terms "Lord" describes God as the "independent, faithful, loving, merciful Savior who shows undeserved favor to people."

4. 我们注意到神在这里称自己为耶和华。他在创世纪一章称自己为神，这是他的另外一个名字。耶和华意思是神是“自主、信实、慈爱、怜悯和爱不配之人的救主。

5. At this point in the chapter, God takes us back to the sixth day of creation so that He can focus on special events from that time.

5. 在这里神再一次将我们带回第六日的创造中，神要特别的回顾那日的特别创造。

6. Why did God delay for a time the reproduction and growth of certain shrubs and plants? (verse 5)

6. 为什么神要草木和菜蔬的繁衍生长推迟一定时间？（第五节）

7. Since it had not rained (God may not have sent the first rain on earth until the time of the Flood - Genesis 7), how did God originally provide water for the vegetation of the world? (verses 5-6)

7. 耶和华没有降雨（神可能直到创世纪7章大洪水的时候才第一次降雨），他是如何为植物提供水源的？（5-6节）

8. What do we learn about how God specially created the first man in verse 7?

8. 从第七节神如何特别地造第一个人时我们可以学到什么？

9. What do you find in the account of the creation of man that is:

9. 你发现人的受造是：

a. exalting? 升高的？

b. humbling? 降卑的？

Verses 8-14-- 8-14节

8) Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there He put the man He had formed. 9) And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground - trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 10) A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. 11) The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12) (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) 13) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. 14) The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

8）耶和华神在东方的伊甸立了一个园子，把所造的人安置在那里。9） 耶和华神使各样的树从地里长出来，可以悦人的眼目，其上的果子好作食物。园子当中又有生命树和分别善恶的树。10）有河从伊甸流出来，滋润那园子，从那里分为四道。11）第一道名叫比逊，就是环绕哈腓拉全地的。在那里有金子，12）并且那地的金子是好的。在那里又有珍珠和红玛瑙。13）第二道河名叫基训，就是环绕古实全地的。14）第三道河名叫西底结，流在亚述的东边。第四道河就是伯拉河。

10. What does God tell us about the special home He had made for the man? (verses 8-14)

10. 关于神为人造的特别的家他是怎样为我们描述的？（8-14节）

11. The word "Eden" means "delight or bliss." While we know that this wonderful place existed, we do not know its exact location. The Flood at the time of Noah (Genesis 6-8) radically changed the world from its original condition. From the mention of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, many guess that Eden may have been in what is now the region of southeastern Iraq or eastern Turkey. However, we cannot be sure of this.

11. 伊甸一词意思是“喜乐或祝福”。我们虽知其确实存在但却无法确定其具体位置。诺亚时代（创世纪6-8章）的洪水使世界发生了翻天覆地的变化。从提到的底格里斯河和幼发拉底河很多人猜测伊甸园可能位于伊拉克南部或土耳其东部，但关于这一点并无盖棺定论。

### Verses 15-17-- 15-17节

15) The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16) And the Lord God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17) but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for when you eat of it you will surely die."

15）耶和华神将那人安置在伊甸园，使他修理看守。16）耶和华神吩咐他说，园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃。17）只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死。

12. What work did God give the man to do? (verse 15)

12. 神分派给人什么工作？（15节）

13. Agree or Disagree? Our work is a good thing that God lovingly gives us for our good. (Explain your answer)

13. 同意或不同意？工作是神出于爱赐给的、于我们有益的恩典。

14. What two trees had God placed in the middle of the Garden of Eden? (verse 9b)

14. 神在园子中间放了两颗什么树？（九节下半节）

15. What command did God give the man regarding the trees in the Garden of Eden? (verses 16-17)

15. 关于园中的树木神给了那人什么命令？（16-17节）

16. What was God's purpose in giving this command about not eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?

16. 神命令人不可吃分别善恶树上的果子是为了什么？

17. What risk did God take by establishing this rule and issuing this command? (verve 17)

17. 神设立这个法则和命令有什么风险？（17节）

18. Martin Luther described the tree of the knowledge of good and evil as "Adam and Eve's altar" where they could worship and give honor and glory to God. What did Luther mean by his description?

18. 马丁路德称分别善恶树为“亚当和夏娃的祭坛”，是他们可以靠着来荣耀神的。路德这么说是什么意思？

19. What did Adam and Eve have to gain by keeping this command? (see verse 9b)

19. 亚当和夏娃守这条命令会得到什么？（九节下半节）

### Verses 18-20-- 18-20节

18) The Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." 19) Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what He would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20) So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.

18）耶和华神说，那人独居不好，我要为他造一个配偶帮助他。19）耶和华神用土所造成的野地各样走兽和空中各样飞鸟都带到那人面前，看他叫什么。那人怎样叫各样的活物，那就饲它的名字。20）那人便给一切牲畜和空中飞鸟，野地走兽都起了名。只是那人没有遇见配偶帮助他。

20. What did God say about the man's situation at this point in the creation?" (verse 18a)

20. 此时神是如何看那人的生活状态的？（18节上半节）

21. What plan did God have to remedy the man's aloneness? (verse 18b)

21. 神是如何计划来弥补那人的孤单的？（18节下半节）

22. What roles did God design for man and woman in their relationship with each other? (verse 18)

22. 神是如何分配男人和女人在相互关系中的角色？

23. 神给那人什么工作使他可以发挥自己的才智和管理万物的权柄并预备好欣赏神所赐的女人？（19-20节）

24. We note that the man's name appears first in this verse. God had given him the name "Adam" which means "From the ground."

24. 我们注意到男人的名字第一次出现在这一节中。 神给他取名叫“亚当”意思是“来自尘土”。

### Verses 21-25-- 21-25节

21) So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. 22) Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib that He had taken out of the man, and He brought her to the man. 23) The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man." 24) For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. 25) The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

21）耶和华神使他沉睡，他就睡了。于是取下他的一条肋骨，又把肉合起来。22）耶和华神就用那人身上所取的肋骨，造成一个女人，领她到那人跟前。23）那人说，这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称她为女人，因为她是从男人身上取出来的。24）因此，人要离开父母与妻子连合，二人成为一体。25）当时夫妻二人赤身露体，并不羞耻。
