|    1.People are born with no capability for good.         |   1.People are born with no capability for good.        |  1.People are born with a capability for good.        |
|   人生来没有良善          |   人生来没有良善         |    人生来能够行善       |
|     2.God preselected and predestined the people who will one day be in heaven. This is the opposite of what they deserve.        |   2.God preselected and predestined the people who will one day be in heaven. He did the same thing for those who will go to hell.         |  2.God preselected and predestined the people who He knew would end up becoming believers.         |
|   神预先拣选和预定那些有一天将进天国的人。这是他们不配得的。            |   神预先拣选和预定那些人有一天将进天国。同样神预先拣选和预定哪些人有一天将下地狱。         |  神预先拣选和预定那些他知道将最终成为信徒的人。         |
|  3.Jesus earned a verdict from God of “not guilty” for all the people in the world, regardless of whether they would believe.             |   3.Jesus earned a verdict from God of “not guilty” only for the people He preselected and predestined to be in heaven one day.        |  3.Jesus earned a verdict from God of “not guilty” only for the people He knew would become believers.         |
|   耶稣为所有世人挣得神“无罪”的判决，不论他们是否相信。            |    耶稣只为他预先拣选和预定有一天进天国的人挣得神“无罪”的判决。         |   耶稣只为他知道将成为信徒的人挣得神“无罪”的判决。       |
|   4.God uses the news about Jesus to reach the unsaved and help them depend on Jesus.          |   4.Conversion is immediate and irresistible.           |   4.Conversion involves you making a decision to invite Jesus into your heart and make Him the Lord of your life. You have the ability to refuse Jesus’ gift.        |
|    神使用耶稣的福音信息感动未得救的人并帮助他们信靠耶稣。         |   信仰转变是即刻的，不可抗拒的。         |    信仰转变涉及到你做决定邀请耶稣进入你的心，让他做你生命的主。你有能力拒绝耶稣的礼物。      |
|   5.The Bible warns us that we can lose our faith. God also says that when we get to heaven, it is only because He helped keep us depending on Him. We need both law and gospel because we have an evil nature and a holy nature that the Holy Spirit gave us when He made us believers.          |   5.Once God saved you, you will always stay a believer and get to heaven. You will never reject Jesus. “Once saved, always saved.”          |  5.It is possible for you to turn away from Jesus once the Holy Spirit has made you a believer in Jesus. You can never be sure of where you stand with God.         |
|   圣经警告我们可能会失去信心。神也说到我们去天国只是因为他帮助我们持守信靠他。我们既需要律法也需要福音，因为我们既有罪性也有圣灵在使我们相信神时赐给我们的圣洁性情。          |  一旦神拯救你，你将永远是一个信徒，会去天国。你永不会拒绝耶稣。“一次得救，永远得救。”             |      一旦圣灵使你相信耶稣，成为信徒，你有可能再拒绝耶稣。你永远无法确信你与神是否一致。     |
