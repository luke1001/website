Someone wise once said, "People who don’t learn from the mistakes of the past will make the same mistakes themselves." The history of Christianity after Jesus went back to heaven tells what Christians as individuals and groups have done. There are a lot of important lessons for us today. Christian history has influenced us. We can learn it and benefit from it, or we can ignore it and hurt ourselves. With the help of God’s Word and wisdom we pray we learn and benefit.

曾有智者说：“不从历史的错误中汲取教训的人将犯同样的错误。”耶稣升天后的基督教历史告诉我们基督教中的个人和团体所做的事情。我们今天也能从中得到很重要的教训。基督教历史影响着我们。我们可以选择学习并从中获益，或者因忽视这些历史而受伤害。我们祈祷上帝的话语和智慧帮助我们从中学习并获益。
