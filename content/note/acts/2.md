##### Acts 2 :1-47 使徒行传 2:1-47

###### The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost 圣灵降临 

1 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Who is “they”? Where were they gathered? 

2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. What do we think is coming when we hear “a violent wind”? 

3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. Were the disciples burned when the tongues of fire rested on them? 

4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tonguesas the Spirit enabled them. What did it mean to be filled with the Holy Spirit? What else? 

5 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. Who are the God-fearing Jews from every nation? 

6 When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken. What did they hear spoken? 

7 Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans? Why would it be unusual for a Galilean to speak in other languages? 

8 Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language? 9 Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome 11 (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!” What were the wonders of God? 12 Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?” What had many of the people not yet realized? 13 Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.” What did some of the attendees think? 


1 五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。门徒们是谁？他们在哪里聚集的？

2 忽然，从天上有响声下来，好像一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子，当他们听到一阵大风的时候，你认为是什么来到了那里？

3 又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分开落在他们各人头上。当如火焰的舌头落在门徒身上的时候，他们被烧着了吗？

4 他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才说起别国的话来。被圣灵充满是什么意思？还有别的问题吗？ 

5 那时，有虔诚的犹太人从天下各国来，住在耶路撒冷。从天下各国来的虔诚犹太人是指什么？

6 这声音一响，众人都来聚集，各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷；他们听见门徒们说什么了？

7 都惊讶希奇说：「看哪，这说话的不都是加利利人吗？

8 我们各人怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？9我们帕提亚人、米底亚人、以拦人，和住在美索不达米亚、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚细亚、10 弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的利比亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人，11 克里特和阿拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说　神的大作为。」神的大作为是什么？12 众人就都惊讶猜疑，彼此说：「这是什么意思呢？」众人还不明白什么？13 还有人讥诮说：「他们无非是新酒灌满了。」还有些人是怎样想的？

###### Peter Addresses the Crowd 彼得在五旬节的讲论

14 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd : “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. Why do you think Peter was the spokesman? (See Luke 5:10) 15 These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! 

16 No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: taken from Joel 2:28-32. 17 “‘In the last days, God says, What are the last days? I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. What will happen when God pours out His Spirit? 

18 Even on my servants, both men and women, Who will be honored? I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 

19 I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. 20 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. 21 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’ Who will be saved? 

22 “Fellow Israelites, listen to this : Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. What had Jesus done to show He was the Messiah? 

23 This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. What happened next? 24 But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. How did Jesus show He triumphed over the devil? 25 David said about him: What do you know about David? Look at Psalms 16:8-11, what connection is Peter making? “‘I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

26 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope, 27 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay. 28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.’ Why should we be glad? 

29 “Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. 30 But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. What was Peter reminding the Jews? 

31 Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay. 32 God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it. What had the disciples witnessed? 

33 Exalted to the right hand of God, where did Jesus go? he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. What was poured out on the people? 

34 For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, “‘The Lord said to my Lord : Who is “the Lord?” Who is “my Lord?” “Sit at my right hand 35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’ What had David realized? 

36 “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this : God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.” What is the conclusion? 

37 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” What does it mean to be “cut to the heart”? What did the people want? 

38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. What is baptism and why is it important? And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. What is the gift of the Holy Spirit? 

39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”For whom is the promise? 

40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”Why would Peter call this generation corrupt? 41 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. 


14 彼得和十一个使徒站起，高声说：「犹太人和一切住在耶路撒冷的人哪，这件事你们当知道，也当侧耳听我的话。你认为为什么是彼得在这里发言？（参看路加福音5 :10）

15 你们想这些人是醉了；其实不是醉了，因为时候刚到巳初。16 这正是先知约珥所说的：引自约珥书 2:28-32 17 神说：在末后的日子，什么是末后的日子？ 我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的。 你们的儿女要说预言； 你们的少年人要见异象； 老年人要做异梦。当神浇灌祂的灵时会发生什么事？ 

18 在那些日子， 我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和使女， 他们就要说预言。谁会被荣耀？

19 在天上，我要显出奇事； 在地下，我要显出神迹； 有血，有火，有烟雾。 20 日头要变为黑暗， 月亮要变为血； 这都在主大而明显的日子未到以前。 21 到那时候， 凡求告主名的，就必得救。谁会得救？ 

22 「以色列人哪，请听我的话：　神借着拿撒勒人耶稣在你们中间施行异能、奇事、神迹，将他证明出来，这是你们自己知道的。耶稣行了什么事显明了祂是弥赛亚？

23 他既按着　神的定旨先见被交与人，你们就借着无法之人的手，把他钉在十字架上，杀了。24 神却将死的痛苦解释了，叫他复活，因为他原不能被死拘禁。耶稣怎样显明祂胜过魔鬼25 大卫指着他说：你知道哪些关于大卫的事？请看诗篇 16 :8-11,彼得将什么联系起来了 我看见主常在我眼前； 他在我右边，叫我不至于摇动。 

26 所以，我心里欢喜， 我的灵快乐； 并且我的肉身要安居在指望中。 27 因你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间， 也不叫你的圣者见朽坏。 28 你已将生命的道路指示我， 必叫我因见你的面 得着满足的快乐。我们为什么应该快乐？ 

29 「弟兄们！先祖大卫的事，我可以明明地对你们说：他死了，也葬埋了，并且他的坟墓直到今日还在我们这里。30 大卫既是先知，又晓得　神曾向他起誓，要从他的后裔中立一位坐在他的宝座上，彼得提醒犹太人什么事？

31就预先看明这事，讲论基督复活说： 他的灵魂不撇在阴间； 他的肉身也不见朽坏。 32 这耶稣，　神已经叫他复活了，我们都为这事作见证。门徒见证了什么事？

33 他既被　神的右手高举，耶稣去了哪里？又从父受了所应许的圣灵，就把你们所看见所听见的，浇灌下来。是什么浇灌下来？

34 大卫并没有升到天上，但自己说： 主对我主说：谁是“主”，谁是“我主”？ 你坐在我的右边， 35 等我使你仇敌作你的脚凳。大卫相信什么？ 

36 「故此，以色列全家当确实地知道，你们钉在十字架上的这位耶稣，　神已经立他为主，为基督了。」结论是什么？ 

37 众人听见这话，觉得扎心，就对彼得和其余的使徒说：「弟兄们，我们当怎样行？」“觉得扎心”是什么意思？众人想要怎样？ 

38 彼得说：「你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，什么是受洗？并且为什么洗礼很重要？就必领受所赐的圣灵；所赐的圣灵是什么？

39 因为这应许是给你们和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主—我们　神所召来的。」应许是给谁的？

40 彼得还用许多话作见证，劝勉他们说：「你们当救自己脱离这弯曲的世代。」彼得为什么称这世代是弯曲的？41 于是领受他话的人就受了洗。那一天，门徒约添了三千人，

###### Notes 注释 

About three thousand - This was the beginning of the New Testament Christian Church. 

三千人– 这是新约教会的起始

###### The Fellowship of the Believers 在圣徒中间的生活

42 They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Name the 4 ways that the believers responded. 

43 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. What were the apostles able to do? 

44 All the believers were together and had everything in common. 45 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. How did the believers show their faith was alive? 

46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. How often did the people meet? Why? They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. What was the result of people honoring God in their homes? 


42 都恒心遵守使徒的教训，彼此交接，擘饼，祈祷。举出四种信徒回应的方式。

43 众人都惧怕；使徒又行了许多奇事神迹。使徒能够行什么事？

44 信的人都在一处，凡物公用，45 并且卖了田产、家业，照各人所需用的分给各人。信徒怎样显明他们活泼的信心？

46 他们天天同心合意恒切地在殿里，他们多久聚集一次？为什么？且在家中擘饼，存着欢喜、诚实的心用饭，47 赞美　神，得众民的喜爱。主将得救的人天天加给他们。 人们在家中敬畏神的结果将是怎样的？
