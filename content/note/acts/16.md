###### Timothy Joins Paul and Silas 提摩太跟保罗、西拉同工

1 Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek. Why would Paul go to Derbe and Lystra? 

2 The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. What do we learn about Timothy? 

3 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. Why would Paul want Timothy circumcised?

4 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. What decisions did they deliver? 5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

1 保罗来到特庇，又到路司得。在那里有一个门徒，名叫提摩太，是信主之犹太妇人的儿子，他父亲却是希腊人。保罗为什么要去特庇和路司得？

2 路司得和以哥念的弟兄都称赞他。我们对提摩太有哪些了解？

3 保罗要带他同去，只因那些地方的犹太人都知道他父亲是希腊人，就给他行了割礼。为什么保罗要提摩太受割礼？

4 他们经过各城，把耶路撒冷使徒和长老所定的条规交给门徒遵守。他们传达了什么规条？5 于是众教会信心越发坚固，人数天天加增。

###### Paul’s Vision of the Man of Macedonia保罗看见马其顿人的异象

6 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. Where did the Holy Spirit keep Paul and his companions from traveling? 

7 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. Where else were they kept from preaching? 

8 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. 9 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” 10 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. Why did Paul and his companions travel to Macedonia? Who is joining the journey?(we) What is the continent Paul and his companions have traveled to?

6 圣灵既然禁止他们在亚细亚讲道，他们就经过弗吕家、加拉太一带地方。圣灵不许保罗和他的同伴去哪里？

7 到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。圣灵还禁止他们在哪里讲道？

8 他们就越过每西亚，下到特罗亚去。9 在夜间有异象现与保罗。有一个马其顿人站着求他说：「请你过到马其顿来帮助我们。」10 保罗既看见这异象，我们随即想要往马其顿去，以为　神召我们传福音给那里的人听。为什么保罗和他的同伴要往马其顿去？还有谁加入了他们？（我们）保罗和他的同伴要向哪一处大陆前行？

###### Notes: 注释

Phrygia and Galatia - The district of Phrygia was formerly Greek and recently had been divided between the Roman provinces of Asia and Galatia. Iconium and Antioch were in Galatia.

弗吕家、加拉太– 弗吕家地区曾属希腊，后来被罗马划分为亚洲行省和加拉太的一部分。以哥念和安提阿都属加拉太。

Asia - This province included the Greek districts of Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and parts of Phrygia. This is not the continent of Asia.

亚西亚– 这个行省包括属希腊的每西亚、吕底亚、Caria和弗吕家的一部分。这不是指亚洲大陆

Mysia - In the northwest part of the province of Asia.
每西亚–在亚西亚省的西北面。

Troas - Located 16 kilometers (10 miles) from ancient Troy. Troas is an important seaport for connections between Macedonia and Greece on one side and Asia on the other side.

特罗亚– 距离古城特洛伊16公里（10英里）。特罗亚是重要的港口城市。它一边连接着马其顿和希腊，另一边连接着亚西亚。

###### Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi  吕底亚归主

11 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day we went on to Neapolis. 12 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. Why do you think they stayed there several days? (See next verse)

13 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.  Who did they speak with? 

14 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. What do we learn about Lydia? The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message. 

15 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. How did Lydia respond to Paul's message? “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us. What type of hospitality did Lydia show to Paul and his companions?

11 于是从特罗亚开船，一直行到撒摩特喇，第二天到了尼亚坡里。12 从那里来到腓立比，就是马其顿这一方的头一个城，也是罗马的驻防城。我们在这城里住了几天。你认为他们为什么要在那里住几天？（参看下一节）

13 当安息日，我们出城门，到了河边，知道那里有一个祷告的地方，我们就坐下对那聚会的妇女讲道。他们在向谁讲道？

14 有一个卖紫色布疋的妇人，名叫吕底亚，是推雅推喇城的人，素来敬拜　神。我们对于吕底亚有哪些了解？她听见了，主就开导她的心，叫她留心听保罗所讲的话。

15 她和她一家既领了洗，吕底亚怎样回应保罗的信息？便求我们说：「你们若以为我是真信主的，请到我家里来住」；于是强留我们。吕底亚是如何接待保罗和他的同伴的？

###### Notes: 注释

Samothrace - An island that was convenient for boats to anchor rather than risk sailing at night.

Many retired legionnaires from the Roman army settled there, but few Jews.

腓立比– 马其顿东部的城市。以腓力二世，亚历山大大帝的父亲命名。因为这是罗马的殖民地，所以独立于地方行省的管辖，由罗马任命了管理组织直接管理。这里居住了很多退休的罗马军官，犹太人并不多见。

Thyatira - There were many trade guilds there, as linen workers, tailors and dyers. The purple dye could have come from madder roots which grew in abundance around Thyatira. Purple cloth was a high-priority item among Romans.

推雅推喇城–在这里有很多商业交易，比如亚麻工人、裁缝和染工。紫色的染料可能由在推雅推喇城周围大面积的茜草制得。紫色布在罗马是高级商品。

###### Paul and Silas in Prison 保罗和西拉被囚

16 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. What was the slave girl able to predict? She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. Who benefitted from her ability? 

17 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.” What is wrong with this proclamation? 

18 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her. What did Paul command?

19 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. 20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar 21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”What were Paul and Silas accused of?

22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. What type of pressure did the magistrates face? 

23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. What happened to Paul and Silas? 

24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. How did the jailer make sure Paul and Silas would not escape?

16 后来，我们往那祷告的地方去。有一个使女迎着面来，她被巫鬼所附，用法术，这个使女如何能用法术？叫她主人们大得财利。她的能力能带来什么好处？

17 她跟随保罗和我们，喊着说：「这些人是至高　神的仆人，对你们传说救人的道。」这些话有什么问题？

18 她一连多日这样喊叫，保罗就心中厌烦，转身对那鬼说：「我奉耶稣基督的名，吩咐你从她身上出来！」那鬼当时就出来了。保罗吩咐了什么？

19 使女的主人们见得利的指望没有了，便揪住保罗和西拉，拉他们到市上去见首领；20 又带到官长面前说：「这些人原是犹太人，竟骚扰我们的城，21 传我们罗马人所不可受不可行的规矩。」保罗和西拉的罪名是什么？

22 众人就一同起来攻击他们。官长吩咐剥了他们的衣裳，用棍打；官长受到什么样的压力？

23 打了许多棍，便将他们下在监里，嘱咐禁卒严紧看守。保罗和西拉怎样了？

24 禁卒领了这样的命，就把他们下在内监里，两脚上了木狗。禁卒怎样确保保罗和西拉不能逃跑？

25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. How did Paul and Silas continue to witness? 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose. Who sent the earthquake? 27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. Why would the jailer want to kill himself is the prisoners escaped? 28 But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!” How did Paul reassure the jailer?

29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. 30 He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” What did the jailer want to know?

31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. Who did Paul and Silas speak to? 33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. How did the jailer care for Paul and Silas? 34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household. Why was the jailer filled with joy?

25 约在半夜，保罗和西拉祷告，唱诗赞美　神，众囚犯也侧耳而听。保罗和西拉怎样继续做见证？

26 忽然，地大震动，甚至监牢的地基都摇动了，监门立刻全开，众囚犯的锁链也都松开了。是谁使地大震动？

27 禁卒一醒，看见监门全开，以为囚犯已经逃走，就拔刀要自杀。为什么禁卒以为囚犯逃走就要自杀？

28 保罗大声呼叫说：「不要伤害自己！我们都在这里。」保罗如何使禁卒安心？

29 禁卒叫人拿灯来，就跳进去，战战兢兢地俯伏在保罗、西拉面前；30 又领他们出来，说：「二位先生，我当怎样行才可以得救？」禁卒想要知道什么道理？

31 他们说：「当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。」32 他们就把主的道讲给他和他全家的人听。保罗和西拉向谁讲道？

33 当夜，就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤；他和属乎他的人立时都受了洗。禁卒如何对待保罗和西拉的？

34 于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭。他和全家，因为信了　神，都很喜乐。禁卒为什么喜乐？

35 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: “Release those men.” 36 The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”What were Paul and Silas told?

37 But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.” Why do you think Paul and Silas wanted the magistrates to escort them out?

38 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. Why would they become alarmed? 39 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. Why did they want Paul and Silas to leave? 40 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Why did they go back to Lydia's house? Then they left.

35 到了天亮，官长打发差役来，说：「释放那两个人吧。」36 禁卒就把这话告诉保罗说：「官长打发人来叫释放你们，如今可以出监，平平安安地去吧。」保罗和西拉收到什么信息？

37 保罗却说：「我们是罗马人，并没有定罪，他们就在众人面前打了我们，又把我们下在监里，现在要私下撵我们出去吗？这是不行的。叫他们自己来领我们出去吧！」你为什么认为保罗和西拉要求他们自己来领他们出去？

38 差役把这话回禀官长。官长听见他们是罗马人，就害怕了，他们为什么害怕？

39 于是来劝他们，领他们出来，请他们离开那城。他们为什么想要保罗和西拉离开？40 二人出了监，往吕底亚家里去，见了弟兄们，劝慰他们一番，他们为什么又回到吕底亚的家里？就走了。 

###### Notes:注释

Roman citizens - Roman law exempted Roman citizens from all degrading forms of punishment. The beating they delivered could not only cost them their jobs but their lives.

罗马人– 罗马法律规定罗马公民免受一切侮辱性的刑罚。他们用棍打罗马公民的行为可能使他们被免职甚至丧命。
