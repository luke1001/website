###### In Thessalonica 在帖撒罗尼迦

1 When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. 2 As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 3 explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said. How did Paul reason with the Jews?  4 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women. How was Paul's message received?

5 But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. What did the non-believing Jews do? They rushed to Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.  6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, 7 and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”What was the charge?  8 When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. 9 Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. What do you think was meant by Jason and the others posting bond?

1 保罗和西拉经过暗妃坡里、亚波罗尼亚，来到帖撒罗尼迦，在那里有犹太人的会堂。2 保罗照他素常的规矩进去，一连三个安息日，本着圣经与他们辩论，3 讲解陈明基督必须受害，从死里复活；又说：「我所传与你们的这位耶稣就是基督。」保罗如何与犹太人辩论的？4 他们中间有些人听了劝，就附从保罗和西拉，并有许多虔敬的希腊人，尊贵的妇女也不少。保罗的信息被接受了吗？

5 但那不信的犹太人心里嫉妒，招聚了些市井匪类，搭伙成群，不信的犹太人做了什么？耸动合城的人闯进耶孙的家，要将保罗、西拉带到百姓那里。6 找不着他们，就把耶孙和几个弟兄拉到地方官那里，喊叫说：「那搅乱天下的也到这里来了，7 耶孙收留他们。这些人都违背凯撒的命令，说另有一个王耶稣。」他们的控告是什么？8 众人和地方官听见这话，就惊慌了；9 于是取了耶孙和其余之人的保状，就释放了他们。你觉得取了耶孙和其余人的保状是什么意思？

###### Notes: 注释

Thessalonica - In addition to being the capital of the province of Macedonia, it was a naval base and an important commercial port. Politically it was a "free city" which meant that no Roman soldiers were stationed in it.

帖撒罗尼迦 – 除了是马其顿行省的首都之外，它还是一个海军基地和重要的商业港口。在政治上，这是一座自由的城市，意味着这里没有罗马士兵驻扎。

###### In Berea在庇哩亚

10 As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. Now where are Paul and Silas going? On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. 11 Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. Describe the Berean Christians. 12 As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. Who believed?

13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. What happened when the non-believing Jews from Thessalonica arrived? 

14 The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. 15 Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. Where was Paul escorted?

10 弟兄们随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。现在保罗和西拉要到哪里去？二人到了，就进入犹太人的会堂。11 这地方的人贤于帖撒罗尼迦的人，甘心领受这道，天天考查圣经，要晓得这道是与不是。请描述庇哩亚的信徒。12 所以他们中间多有相信的，又有希腊尊贵的妇女，男子也不少。哪些人相信了？

13 但帖撒罗尼迦的犹太人知道保罗又在庇哩亚传　神的道，也就往那里去，耸动搅扰众人。当帖撒罗尼迦不信的犹太人到了以后，发生了什么事？

14 当时弟兄们便打发保罗往海边去，西拉和提摩太仍住在庇哩亚。15 送保罗的人带他到了雅典，既领了保罗的命，叫西拉和提摩太速速到他这里来，就回去了。保罗被护送到哪里去？

###### In Athens 在雅典

16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. What did Paul notice? 

17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. How did Paul spend his time? 

18 A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. What was Paul preaching? 

19 Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? Why did the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers bring Paul?  

20 You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.” 21 (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) How are the Athenians and foreigners described?

16 保罗在雅典等候他们的时候，看见满城都是偶像，就心里着急；保罗注意到什么？

17 于是在会堂里与犹太人和虔敬的人，并每日在市上所遇见的人，辩论。保罗是怎么度过这些日子的？

18 还有伊壁鸠鲁和斯多亚两门的学士，与他争论。有的说：「这胡言乱语的要说什么？」有的说：「他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。」这话是因保罗传讲耶稣与复活的道。保罗传讲的是什么？

19 他们就把他带到亚略·巴古，说：「你所讲的这新道，我们也可以知道吗？伊壁鸠鲁和斯多亚的哲学家为什么要带他到亚略巴古？

20 因为你有些奇怪的事传到我们耳中，我们愿意知道这些事是什么意思。」（21 雅典人和住在那里的客人都不顾别的事，只将新闻说说听听。）这里是怎么描述雅典人和住在那里的客人的？

22 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. 23 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What had Paul found when he walked around Athens? So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you. What was the altar to an unknown God to the Athenians?

24 “The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. How does Paul describe God? 

25 And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. What does God give to people? 

26 From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. 27 God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. What did God want? 

28 ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’29 “Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. 30 In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. What had God overlooked? What would the Athenians have to do? 

31 For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.” To whom was Paul referring?

22 保罗站在亚略·巴古当中，说：「众位雅典人哪，我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。23 我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着『未识之神』。当保罗周游雅典的时候，他有哪些发现？你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们。放置未识之神的祭坛对于雅典人来说意味着什么？

24 创造宇宙和其中万物的　神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿，保罗是怎样讲述神的？

25 也不用人手服事，好像缺少什么；自己倒将生命、气息、万物，赐给万人。神将什么赐给人？

26 他从一本造出万族的人，住在全地上，并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界，27 要叫他们寻求　神，或者可以揣摩而得，其实他离我们各人不远；神要求什么？

28 我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎他。就如你们作诗的，有人说：『我们也是他所生的。』29 我们既是　神所生的，就不当以为　神的神性像人用手艺、心思所雕刻的金、银、石。30 世人蒙昧无知的时候，　神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。神不再监察什么事？雅典人现在要怎样行？

31 因为他已经定了日子，要借着他所设立的人按公义审判天下，并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。」保罗是指着谁说的？

32 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.” What was the reaction to the message that Paul preached? 33 At that, Paul left the Council. 34 Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others. Do you think Paul continued to teach the people who wanted to hear more on the subject?


32 众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的；又有人说：「我们再听你讲这个吧！」众人对保罗所讲的信息是怎样回应的？33 于是保罗从他们当中出去了。34 但有几个人贴近他，信了主，其中有亚略·巴古的官丢尼修，并一个妇人，名叫大马哩，还有别人一同信从。你觉得保罗是否继续教导哪些愿意听这信息的人？


###### Notes:注释

Athens - An outstanding metropolis and cultural center. Athens was at the height of its power about 500 years before. It was the foremost Greek city state partly because it resisted the Persian invasions. It was then that the people of Athens produced their greatest sculpture, architecture, and drama.

雅典 – 一座卓越的都市和文化中心。在五百年前，雅典达到她的权力高峰。起初由于她抵抗波斯的进攻而就被看为是居首的希腊城市。后来更因她的居民所创作的雕刻、建筑和戏剧而闻名。

Epicurean - The philosophy centers on the theme of happiness, tranquility, and pleasure. The truly happy person is one whose life is marked by the absence of pain, anguish, fear, terror, and destitution. No divine assistance is needed to attain the happy life. A wise person can retain tranquility even in time of pain. There is no life after death, a person becomes extinct.

伊壁鸠鲁– 一种哲学思想，着重于幸福、安宁和享乐。认为真正快乐的人是生命里没有伤痛、烦恼、恐惧、担忧和缺乏的人。人无需来自神的帮助即可获得快乐的生命。一个有智慧的人可以在伤痛的时候也能保持安宁。人死后即消失不再存在。

Stoic - A belief that God and nature are one. People are the offspring of God because God is the soul of the world. Man is an extension of God. Man's purpose in life is to live in harmony with nature and with himself. All this is achieved by controlling the passions and all unjust thoughts

斯多亚- 相信神和自然结合为一体。人是神的后裔因为神是整个世界的灵。人类是神的附属。人生命的目的就是达到自我和自然的和谐。人可以通过控制欲念和不正确的思想来达到这一目的。

Believers in Epicureanism and Stoicism are poles apart. The philosophy saw God nowhere; the other saw him everywhere. Therefore Paul talking to people with religious backgrounds different from Jews. Paul had to talk with them on the basis on the natural law of God written the heart which is what he did when he spoke before the Areopagus.

伊壁鸠鲁和斯多亚的信念截然相反。一个认为神根本不存在一个认为神存在在万事万物中。因此保罗是在对一些有着完全不同于犹太的宗教背景的人讲话。在亚略巴古，保罗按着神显明在人心里的普遍启示向他们讲论。

Areopagus - The official court in Athens. Paul was to speak to satisfy their curiosity, not to put Paul on trial. The Areopagus had supreme authority over religious and educational affairs; it was composed of distinguished persons who had been rulers or elected officials.

亚略巴古-在雅典的公认的委员会。保罗因为他们的好奇而向他们讲论，并不是保罗在受审。亚略巴古在宗教和教导领域的事具有最高的权威；它由一些做官长的贵族组成。
