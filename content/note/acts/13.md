##### Acts 13:1-52 使徒行传 13：1-52

In Acts 1-12, Peter is the apostle who is on center stage, but for the remaining chapters, Paul is the key figure. Acts 13 and 14 are about Paul's first missionary journey. Estimates say the journey took place somewhere between 46-48 A.D. The first three missionary journeys begin at the church in Antioch, Syria.

在使徒行传 1-12章，彼得是被主要记述的使徒，但在接下来的章节里，保罗成为了主要人物。使徒行传13和14章记载了保罗的第一次传教之旅。此行估计发生在公元46-48年间的某个时期。起初三次的传教旅行都由叙利亚的安提阿教会开始。

1 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul. 2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Who did the Holy Spirit call? 3 So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.  What did the congregation do before sending Saul and Barnabas off?

1 在安提阿的教会中，有几位先知和教师，就是巴拿巴和称呼尼结的西面、古利奈人路求，与分封之王希律同养的马念，并扫罗。2 他们事奉主、禁食的时候，圣灵说：「要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗，去做我召他们所做的工。」圣灵召谁去做工？3 于是禁食祷告，按手在他们头上，就打发他们去了。会众在打法扫罗和巴拿巴走之前做了什么事?

###### On Cyprus 在塞浦路斯

4 The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus. Why might they have started with Cyprus? (Hint: Acts 4:36) 

5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. Where did they begin their work? Why? John was with them as their helper. Who was John? (Hint: Acts 12:12 See Notes.)

6 They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. Where is Paphos located?  There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, What do we learn about Bar-Jesus? 

7 who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. Why did Sergius Paulus want to see Barnabas and Saul? 

8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith. Why would Elymas try to turn Sergius Paulus from faith? 

9 Then Saul, who was also called Paul, What name will Saul be known by from this time on?) filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, 10 “You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! What does it mean to be a child of the devil? (Hint: John 8:43-44) You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? 

11 Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, not even able to see the light of the sun.” What was God's judgment? Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 12 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord. Why did the proconsul believe?

4 他们既被圣灵差遣，就下到西流基，从那里坐船往塞浦路斯去。他们为什么先到塞浦路斯去？（提示：使徒行传4:36）

5 到了撒拉米，就在犹太人各会堂里传讲　神的道，他们在哪里开始他们的做工？为什么？也有约翰作他们的帮手。约翰是谁？（提示：使徒行传 12:12注释）

6 经过全岛，直到帕弗，帕弗在什么地方？ 在那里遇见一个有法术、假充先知的犹太人，名叫巴·耶稣。我们对巴·耶稣有哪些了解？

7 这人常和方伯士求·保罗同在。士求·保罗是个通达人，他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来，要听　神的道。为什么士求·保罗想要见巴拿巴和保罗？

8 只是那行法术的以吕马（这名翻出来就是行法术的意思）敌挡使徒，要叫方伯不信真道。为什么以吕马要叫士求·保罗不信真道？

9 扫罗又名保罗，扫罗从此要被称为什么名字被圣灵充满，定睛看他，10 说：「你这充满各样诡诈奸恶，魔鬼的儿子，众善的仇敌，成为魔鬼的儿子意味着什么？（提示：约翰福音 8:43-44）你混乱主的正道还不止住吗？

11 现在主的手加在你身上，你要瞎眼，暂且不见日光。」神怎样审判的？他的眼睛立刻昏蒙黑暗，四下里求人拉着手领他。12 方伯看见所做的事，很希奇主的道，就信了。方伯为什么相信？

###### In Pisidian Antioch 在彼西底的安提阿

13 From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. 14 From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down. Where did Paul and his companions go? Why? 

15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.” What were Paul and his companions asked?

13 保罗和他的同人从帕弗开船，来到旁非利亚的别加，约翰就离开他们，回耶路撒冷去。14 他们离了别加往前行，来到彼西底的安提阿，在安息日进会堂坐下。保罗和他的同人去了哪里？为什么？

15 读完了律法和先知的书，管会堂的叫人过去，对他们说：「二位兄台，若有什么劝勉众人的话，请说。」保罗和同伴被要求做什么？

16 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! Who was in the synagogue? 

17 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country; Where does Paul decide to start his exhortation? 18 for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness; 19 and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. 20 All this took about 450 years.


16 保罗就站起来，举手，说：「以色列人和一切敬畏　神的人，请听。在会堂里的是什么人？

17 这以色列民的　神拣选了我们的祖宗，当民寄居埃及的时候抬举他们，用大能的手领他们出来；保罗的劝勉选择从什么时期开始？18 又在旷野容忍他们，约有四十年。19 既灭了迦南地七族的人，就把那地分给他们为业；20 此后给他们设立士师，约有四百五十年，直到先知撒母耳的时候。

“After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 21 Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. 22 After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’ What kind of man was David? Why is Paul recounting the history for the people?

21 后来他们求一个王，　神就将便雅悯支派中基士的儿子扫罗，给他们作王四十年。22 既废了扫罗，就选立大卫作他们的王，又为他作见证说：『我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。』23 从这人的后裔中，　神已经照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。大卫是什么样的人？保罗为什么向这些人重述历史？


23 “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. What connection has Paul made? 

24 Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. What was John's work? 

25 As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ What does Paul want the congregation to understand?


23 从这人的后裔中，　神已经照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。保罗做了怎样衔接？

24 在他没有出来以先，约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。约翰的工作是什么？

25 约翰将行尽他的程途说：『你们以为我是谁？我不是基督；只是有一位在我以后来的，我解他脚上的鞋带也是不配的。』保罗想让会众明白什么？

26 “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. What message was sent? 

27 The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. 28 Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 29 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. What happened to Jesus? Why? 

30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. Why is it important to have witnesses?

26 「弟兄们，亚伯拉罕的子孙和你们中间敬畏　神的人哪，这救世的道是传给我们的。什么样的道被传讲？

27 耶路撒冷居住的人和他们的官长，因为不认识基督，也不明白每安息日所读众先知的书，就把基督定了死罪，正应了先知的预言；28 虽然查不出他有当死的罪来，还是求彼拉多杀他；29 既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话，就把他从木头上取下来，放在坟墓里。什么事发生在耶稣身上？为什么？

30 神却叫他从死里复活。31 那从加利利同他上耶路撒冷的人多日看见他，这些人如今在民间是他的见证。32 我们也报好信息给你们，就是那应许祖宗的话，为什么见证非常重要？

32 “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors 33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. How did God fulfill His promise? As it is written in the second Psalm:
   “‘You are my son;
   today I have become your father.’ (Psalm 2:7)
   34 God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said,
   “‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’(Isaiah 55:3)
   35 So it is also stated elsewhere:
   “‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’(Psalm 16:10)  

32 我们也报好信息给你们，就是那应许祖宗的话，33 神已经向我们这作儿女的应验，叫耶稣复活了。神如何应验祂的应许？正如诗篇第二篇上记着说：你是我的儿子，我今日生你。（诗篇2:7） 34 论到　神叫他从死里复活，不再归于朽坏，就这样说：我必将所应许大卫那圣洁、可靠的恩典赐给你们。（以赛亚书55:3）35 又有一篇上说：你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。（诗篇16:10）

36 “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed. 37 But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. What is the difference between David and Jesus?

38 “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. What message does Paul want his hearers to remember? 

40 Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you: 41 “‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’(Habakkuk 1:5)”

36 「大卫在世的时候遵行了　神的旨意，就睡了，归到他祖宗那里，已见朽坏；37 惟独　神所复活的，他并未见朽坏。大卫和耶稣之间有何区别？

38 所以，弟兄们，你们当晓得：赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。39 你们靠摩西的律法，在一切不得称义的事上信靠这人，就都得称义了。保罗想要听众想起什么？

40 所以，你们务要小心，免得先知书上所说的临到你们。41 主说：你们这轻慢的人要观看，要惊奇，要灭亡；因为在你们的时候，我行一件事，虽有人告诉你们，你们总是不信。」（哈巴谷书 1:5）

42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. What was the initial response to Paul and Barnabas? 

43 When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. What message were Paul and Barnabas given?

44 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. Who came to hear the word of the Lord? 

45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him. Who did the Jews not want to hear the message?

42 他们出会堂的时候，众人请他们到下安息日再讲这话给他们听。起初保罗和巴拿巴受到怎样的回应？

43 散会以后，犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人多有跟从保罗、巴拿巴的。二人对他们讲道，劝他们务要恒久在　神的恩中。保罗和巴拿巴传讲什么样的信息？

44 到下安息日，合城的人几乎都来聚集，要听　神的道。哪些人来听神的道？

45 但犹太人看见人这样多，就满心嫉妒，硬驳保罗所说的话，并且毁谤。犹太人不想让谁听道？

46 Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. What message did Paul and Barnabas give to the Jews? 

47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us:
   “‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,
   that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’"  (Isaiah 49:6) Who is "you" in this verse?

48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. How did the Gentiles receive Paul and Barnabas message?

49 The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. 50 But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. Why incite men and women of high standing? They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. What happened to Paul and Barnabas?  

51 So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium. What does it mean to shake off the dust?  52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

46 保罗和巴拿巴放胆说：「　神的道先讲给你们原是应当的；只因你们弃绝这道，断定自己不配得永生，我们就转向外邦人去。保罗和巴拿巴对犹太人说了什么？

47 因为主曾这样吩咐我们说：我已经立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行救恩，直到地极。」（以赛亚书49:6）这节圣经里的“你”指的是谁？

48 外邦人听见这话，就欢喜了，赞美　神的道；凡预定得永生的人都信了。外邦人是如何领受保罗和巴拿巴的信息的？

49 于是主的道传遍了那一带地方。50 但犹太人挑唆虔敬、尊贵的妇女和城内有名望的人，为什么挑唆尊贵的男女？逼迫保罗、巴拿巴，将他们赶出境外。保罗和巴拿巴遭遇了什么？

51 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土，就往以哥念去了。跺下脚上的尘土是什么意思？52 门徒满心喜乐，又被圣灵充满。
