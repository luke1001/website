##### Acts 7:1-60 使徒行传7：1-60

The following address by Stephen is very long. He was defending himself against a triple charge of blasphemy: against God, against Moses, and against the temple. The one great theme which runs throughout the speech is that of God's grace to Israel and Israel's disobedience.

- Charge 1 - Stephen's defense against blaspheming God. Acts 7:1-18

- Charge 2 - Stephen's defense against blaspheming Moses. Acts 7: 18-43

- Charge 3 - Stephen's defense against blaspheming the Temple. Acts 7: 44-53.

Instead of being defensive, Stephen takes the offensive. The end of chapter 6 concluded with " they saw that his face was like the face of an angel." Jesus had given his disciples a promise for those occasions when they would be put on trail. Matthew 10:19-20 "Do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say, for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you." Stephen was now filled with the Holy Spirit to such a degree that it was evident in his physical appearance.

以下司提反的演讲很长。他在为自己受到的亵渎神亵渎摩西亵渎圣殿的三项控告而辩解。贯穿演讲的一个重要的主题就是神对以色列的恩典以及以色列的悖逆。

- 控告1----司提反对亵渎神的控告的辩解。使徒行传 7：1-18

- 控告 2----司提反对亵渎摩西的控告的辩解。使徒行传 7：18-43

- 控告 3----司提反对亵渎圣殿的控告的辩解。使徒行传7：44-53

司提反不是被动防御而是主动攻击。在第六章结束提到了“在公会里坐着的人，都是定睛看他，见他的面貌，好像天使的面貌。”在门徒们遇到试炼的时候如何应对，主耶稣已给了他们应许。马太福音10：19-20 “10:19 - 你们被交的时候，不要思虑怎样说话或说什么话。到那时候，必赐给你们当说的话。10:20 - 因为不是你们自己说的，乃是你们父的灵在你们里头说的。”司提反已被圣灵大大充满以至于从他的面貌上看都是显而易见的。

###### Stephen’s Speech to the Sanhedrin 司提反对公会讲话

1 Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”

2 To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! What did Stephen call the people who put him on trial? The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran. 3 ‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’ (Cite from Gen. 12:1) What is Abraham called? Who appeared to Abraham? What was the message?

7:1 - 大祭司就说，这些事果然有麽。

7:2 - 司提反说，诸位父兄请听。司提反对那些捉拿他的人是如何称呼的？当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在米所波大米还未住哈兰的时候，荣耀的神向他显现，7:3 - 对他说，你要离开本地和亲族，往我要指示你的地方去。（引自创世纪12：1）亚伯拉罕被称为什么？谁向亚伯拉罕显现？说了什么？

4 “So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. 5 He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. What promise was Abraham given? 

6 God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. Which country had enslaved the Israelites?  

7 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’ (Cite from Gen. 15:13,14) 8 Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.

7:4 - 他就离开迦勒底人之地住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后，神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。7:5 - 在这地方神并没有给他产业，连立足之地也没有给他。但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业。那时他还没有儿子。亚伯拉罕得到什么应许？

7:6 - 神说，他的后裔，必寄居外邦，那里的人，要叫他们作奴仆，苦待他们四百年。那个国家奴役了以色列人？

7:7 - 神又说，使他们作奴仆的那国，我要惩罚，以后他们要出来，在这地方事奉我。（引自创世纪15：13，14）7:8 - 神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒，第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各，雅各生十二位先祖。

9 “Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him 10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace. How did God bless Joseph? 

11 “Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. 12 When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first visit. 13 On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. 14 After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. How did God use Joseph? 

15 Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died. 16 Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.

7:9 - 先祖嫉妒约瑟，把他卖到埃及去。神却与他同在，7:10 - 救他脱离一切苦难，又使他在埃及王法老面前，得恩典有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。神如何赐福与约瑟？

7:11 - 后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒，大受艰难，我们的祖宗，就绝了粮。7:12 - 雅各听见在埃及有粮，就打发我们的祖宗，初次往那里去。7:13 - 第二次约瑟与弟兄相认，他的亲族也被法老知道了。7:14 - 约瑟就打发弟兄请父亲雅各，和全家七十五个人都来。神如何使用约瑟？

7:15 - 于是雅各下了埃及，后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里。7:16 - 又被带到示剑，葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。

17 “As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt had greatly increased. 18 Then ‘a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.’(Cite from Exodus 1:8) 19 He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. What happened to the Israelites under the new king? 

20 “At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for by his family. 21 When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. 22 Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. What do we learn about Moses?

23 “When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. 24 He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. 25 Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. What had the Israelites failed to realize? 26 The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?’ What did Moses attempt?

7:17 - 及至神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到，以色列民在埃及兴盛众多，7:18 - 直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。（引自出埃及记1：8）7:19 - 他用诡计待我们的宗族，苦害我们的祖宗，叫他们丢弃婴孩，使婴孩不能存活。新王兴起后以色列人发生了什么事？

7:20 - 那时，摩西生下来，俊美非凡，在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。7:21 - 他被丢弃的时候，法老的女儿拾了去，养为自己的儿子。7:22 - 摩西学了埃及人一切的学问，说话行事，都有才能。关于摩西我们都学到了什么？

7:23 - 他将到四十岁，心中起意，去看望他的弟兄以色列人。7:24 - 到了那里，见他们一个人受冤屈，就护庇他，为那受欺压的人报仇，打死了埃及人。7:25 - 他以为弟兄必明白神是藉他的手搭救他们。他们却不明白。以色列人没有明白什么？7:26 - 第二天，遇见两个以色列人争斗，就劝他们和睦，说，你们二位是弟兄，为什么彼此欺负呢。摩西试图要做什么？

27 “But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? 28 Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’(Cite from Exodus 2:14)What did Moses realize happened? 

29 When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. 30 “After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. 31 When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer look, he heard the Lord say: 32 ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ (Cite from Exodus 3:6 )Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. Who appeared to Moses?

33 “Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’(Cite from Exodus 3:5,7,8,10) What was God's plan for Moses?

7:27 - 那欺负邻舍的，把他推开说，谁立你作我们的首领，和审判官呢。7:28 - 难道你要杀我，像昨天杀那埃及人麽。（引自出埃及记2：14）摩西意识到发生了什么事？

7:29 - 摩西听见这话就逃走了，寄居于米甸。在那里生了两个儿子。7:30 - 过了四十年，在西乃山的旷野，有一位天使，从荆棘火焰中，向摩西显现。7:31 - 摩西见了那异象，便觉希奇。正进前观看的时候，有主的声音说，7:32 - 我是你列祖的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。（引自出埃及记3：6）摩西战战竞竞，不敢观看。谁向摩西显现？

7:33 - 主对他说，把你脚上的鞋脱下来。因为你所站之地是圣地。7:34 - 我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了。他们悲叹的声音，我也听见了。我下来要救他们，你来，我要差你往埃及去。（引自出埃及记3：5，7，8，10）神对摩西有什么计划？

35 “This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’ How had Moses been rejected? He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 36 He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the wilderness. What do we learn about Moses in vs. 35-36?

37 “This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people.’(Cite from Deut. 18:15) 38 He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.39 “But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. What had the ancestors refused? 

40 They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!’(Cite from Exodus 32:1)

7:35 - 这摩西，就是百姓弃绝说，谁立你作我们的首领，和审判官的。摩西是如何被弃绝的？神却藉那在荆棘中显现之使者的手，差派他作首领，作救赎的。7:36 - 这人领百姓出来，在埃及，在红海，在旷野，四十年间行了奇事神迹。从35-36节关于摩西我们又学到了什么？

7:37 - 那曾对以色列人说，神要从你们弟兄中间，给你们兴起一位先知像我的，就是这位摩西。（引自申命记18：15）7:38 - 这人曾在旷野会中，和西乃山上与那对他说话的天使同在，又与我们的祖宗同在，并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。7:39 - 我们的祖宗不肯听从，反弃绝他，心里归向埃及，他们的祖宗弃绝了什么？

7:40 - 对亚伦说，你且为我们造些神像，在我们前面引路。因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。（引自出埃及记32：1）

41 That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made. How did the Israelites show their unbelief? 

42 But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets:
   “‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
   forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?
43 You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek
   and the star of your god Rephan,
   the idols you made to worship. Why did God turn away from the Israelites?
Therefore I will send you into exile’ beyond Babylon. What was God's punishment?


7:41 - 那时，他们造了一个牛犊，又拿祭物献给那像，欢喜自己手中的工作。以色列人如何表现出他们的不信？

7:42 - 神就转脸不顾，任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰，正如先知书上所写的说，以色列家阿，你们四十年间在旷野，岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我麽。7:43 - 你们抬着摩洛的帐幕，和理番神的星。就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。神为什么远离以色列人？因此，我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。神对他们的惩罚是什么？

44 “Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. 45 After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, 46 who enjoyed God’s favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him. What did Solomon, David's son, build?

48 “However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the prophet says:
   49 “‘Heaven is my throne,
   and the earth is my footstool.
What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord.
   Or where will my resting place be?
50 Has not my hand made all these things?’(Cite from Isaiah 66:1,2)What was God trying to tell the Israelites?


7:44 - 我们的祖宗在旷野，有法柜的帐幕，是神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式作的。7:45 - 这帐幕，我们的祖宗相继承，当神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候，他们同约书亚把张幕搬进承受为业之地，直存到大卫的日子。7:46 - 大卫在神面前蒙恩，祈求为雅各的神豫备居所。7:47 - 却是所罗门为神造成殿宇。大卫的儿子所罗门建造了什么？

7:48 - 其实至高者并不住人手所造的。就如先知所言，7:49 - 主说，天是我的座位，地是我的脚凳。你们要为我造何等的殿宇，那里是我安息的地方呢。7:50 - 这一切都是我手中所造的麽。（引自以赛亚书66：1，2）神要告诉以色列人什么？

51 “You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. Who is Stephen calling stiff-necked? What does it mean to still be uncircumcised? You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Who did they resist? 52 Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him— 53 To whom is Stephen referring? you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it.”What was Stephen telling the Sanhedrin?

7:51 - 你们这硬着颈项，心与耳未受割礼的人，司提反称谁是硬着颈项的？未受割礼是什么意思？常时抗拒圣灵。你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样。他们抗拒谁？7:52 - 那一个先知，不是你们祖宗逼迫呢。他们也把豫先传说那义者要来的人杀了。如今你们又把那义者卖了，杀了。这里司提反在讲谁？7:53 - 你们受了天使所传的律法，竟不遵守。司提反在告诉公会什么？

###### Notes: 注释

Covenant of circumcision - A solemn agreement made between God and Abraham. "Walk before me and be blameless. I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers." Gen. 17:1b-2.
The sign and seal of the covenant was circumcision.

割礼的约 --- 神与亚伯拉罕之间的庄严的约。“你当在我面前作完全人，我就与你立约，使你的后裔极其繁多。”创世纪17：1b-2.这约的印记就是割礼。

Tabernacle of the covenant law - It was a symbol of God's presence and power with the Israelites wherever it went. The ark was a chest made of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold inside and out. It was 3 feet, 9 inches long and 2 feet, 3 inches wide and high. God commanded Moses to put in the ark three items: a golden pot of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written.

法柜的帐幕--- 它所到之处象征着神和大能均与以色列人同在。约柜是一个由皂荚木做的，内外镶金的柜子。它3英尺9英寸长，高和宽均为2英尺3英寸。神命令摩西将三件东西放进约柜里：一金罐的吗哪，亚伦发芽的杖，和写着十诫的两个石板。

###### The Stoning of Stephen 司提反被石头打死

54 When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. Why were they furious? 55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 56 “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.” What did Stephen see?

57 At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, 58 dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. We will read more about Saul in chapter 9. He was the prosecutor.

59 While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 60 Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.”Who else had expressed words with a similar meaning?  When he had said this, he fell asleep. What does it mean to fall asleep?


7:54 - 众人听见这话，就极其恼怒，向司提反咬牙切齿。他们为什么恼怒？7:55 - 但司提反被圣灵充满，定睛望天，看见神的荣耀，又看见耶稣站在神的右边。7:56 - 就说，我看见天开了，人子站在神的右边。司提反看到了什么？

7:57 - 众人大声喊叫，捂着耳朵，齐心拥上前去。7:58 - 把他推到城外，用石头打他。作见证的人，把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。我们能将在第9章中读到更多关于扫罗的事。他当时是迫害基督徒的人。

7:59 - 他们正用石头打的时候，司提反呼吁主说，求耶稣接收我的灵魂。7:60 - 又跪下大声喊着说，主阿，不要将这罪归于他们。谁还说了相似的话？说了这话就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。睡了指的是什么意思？
