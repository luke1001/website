##### Acts 14:1-28 使徒行传 14:1-28

###### In Iconium 在路司得

1 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed. What happened when they spoke the Gospel? 

2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. What did the Jews do? 

3 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. What did the Lord allow Paul and Barnabas to do? 

4 The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles. 5 There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them. What did some of the Jewish and Gentile leaders plan?

6 But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country, 7 where they continued to preach the gospel. What did Paul and Barnabas continue?

1 二人在以哥念同进犹太人的会堂，在那里讲的，叫犹太人和希腊人信的很多。当他们传福音的时候结果如何？

2 但那不顺从的犹太人耸动外邦人，叫他们心里恼恨弟兄。犹太人做了什么事？

3 二人在那里住了多日，倚靠主放胆讲道，主借他们的手施行神迹奇事，证明他的恩道。主借保罗和巴拿巴做了是什么事？

4 城里的众人就分了党，有附从犹太人的，有附从使徒的。5 那时，外邦人和犹太人，并他们的官长，一齐拥上来，要凌辱使徒，用石头打他们。犹太人和官长有计划做什么事？

6 使徒知道了，就逃往吕高尼的路司得、特庇两个城和周围地方去，7 在那里传福音。保罗和巴拿巴继续做什么事？

###### Notes: 注释：

Iconium - The capital of Lycaonia was located 72 kilometers (45 miles) east of Antioch. Had beautiful fertile plans on which grew plums, apricots, wheat, and flax.


以哥念 -吕高尼的首府位于安提阿以东72公里处（45英里）。土地肥沃，种植有李树、杏树和亚麻。

###### In Lystra and Derbe 在路司得和特庇

8 In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked. Who lived in Lystra? 

9 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed What did the man have? 10 and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and began to walk. Describe the miracle.

8 路司得城里坐着一个两脚无力的人，生来是瘸腿的，从来没有走过。住在路司得的是谁？

9 他听保罗讲道，保罗定睛看他，见他有信心，可得痊愈，这人有什么？10 就大声说：「你起来，两脚站直！」那人就跳起来，而且行走。请描述这个神迹。

11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” What did the crowd think? 

12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker. 13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them. What was the plan?

11 众人看见保罗所做的事，就用吕高尼的话大声说：「有神借着人形降临在我们中间了。」众人在想什么？

12 于是称巴拿巴为宙斯，称保罗为希耳米，因为他说话领首。13 有城外宙斯庙的祭司牵着牛，拿着花圈，来到门前，要同众人向使徒献祭。众人计划做什么事？

14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: 15 “Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. What did Paul and Barnabas tell the crowd? We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them. What was the message? 

16 In the past, he let all nations go their own way. 17 Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.” How is this message different than the message when they addressed Jews? 18 Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.

14 巴拿巴、保罗二使徒听见，就撕开衣裳，跳进众人中间，喊着说：15 「诸君，为什么做这事呢？我们也是人，性情和你们一样。保罗和巴拿巴向众人申明什么？我们传福音给你们，是叫你们离弃这些虚妄，归向那创造天、地、海，和其中万物的永生　神。保罗和巴拿巴在传讲什么？

16 他在从前的世代，任凭万国各行其道；17 然而为自己未尝不显出证据来，就如常施恩惠，从天降雨，赏赐丰年，叫你们饮食饱足，满心喜乐。」这些话语和他们对犹太人讲的话语有什么不同？18 二人说了这些话，仅仅地拦住众人不献祭与他们。

19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead. What happened to Paul? 

20 But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. What happened when the disciples gathered around him? The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. Where are Paul and Barnabas going?

19 但有些犹太人从安提阿和以哥念来，挑唆众人，就用石头打保罗，以为他是死了，便拖到城外。保罗遭遇了什么？

20 门徒正围着他，他就起来，走进城去。门徒正围着他的时候，发生了什么事？第二天，同巴拿巴往特庇去，保罗和巴拿巴要去哪里？

###### The Return to Antioch in Syria 回到叙利亚的安提阿

21 They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. What happened when the Gospel was preached in Derbe? Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, 

22 strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. Why was it brave for the disciples to return to these cities? What was their purpose? “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said. 

23 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust. What did Paul and Barnabas find in each city? Who did Paul and Barnabas appoint? 

24 After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia, 25 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.26 From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. 27 On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. What did Paul and Barnabas do when they arrived back. 

28 And they stayed there a long time with the disciples. What are some possible reasons why they stayed a long time?

21 对那城里的人传了福音，使好些人作门徒，当福音传到特庇时发生了什么？就回路司得、以哥念、安提阿去，

22 坚固门徒的心，劝他们恒守所信的道；为什么门徒们要极有勇气才会再次访问这些城市？他们有什么目的？又说：「我们进入　神的国，必须经历许多艰难。」

23 二人在各教会中选立了长老，又禁食祷告，就把他们交托所信的主。保罗和巴拿巴在每个城市做了什么事？选立了哪些人？

24 二人经过彼西底，来到旁非利亚。25 在别加讲了道，就下亚大利去，26 从那里坐船，往安提阿去。当初，他们被众人所托、蒙　神之恩、要办现在所做之工，就是在这地方。27 到了那里，聚集了会众，就述说　神借他们所行的一切事，并　神怎样为外邦人开了信道的门。当保罗和巴拿巴返回时，他们做了什么事？

28 二人就在那里同门徒住了多日。有哪些可能的原因使他们住了多日？
