##### Acts 21:1-40 使徒行传 21:1-40

The ship which Paul and his many companions boarded at Miletus followed a course along the southwestern coast of Asia Minor. Stops were ;made on the elongated island of Cos and at the city of Rhodes. At Rhodes would have seen the 33 meters (105 feet) bronze statue of Apollo, another one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It is thought the ship that they were on was going nor farther or it was a small ship not fit for sailing the open seas.

保罗和他许多同伴所乘的船从米利都起行沿着小亚细亚的西南海岸线航行。他们在细长的岛屿哥士和罗底城停留。罗底城中铸有33米（105英尺）高的阿波罗铜像。这个铜像被称为古代七大奇迹之一。人们认为他们所搭乘的船没有继续前行，或者是因为这是一艘小船不适宜在大海里远航。

###### On to Jerusalem 上耶路撒冷

1 After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Kos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara. 2 We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail. 3 After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo. Why did the ship stop at Tyre? 

4 We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Who did Paul seek out? Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. What did the disciples urge Paul? 

5 When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray. Who came to say good-bye to Paul? 

6 After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home. What took place before left them?

1 我们离别了众人，就开船一直行到哥士。第二天到了罗底，从那里到帕大喇，2 遇见一只船要往腓尼基去，就上船起行。3 望见塞浦路斯，就从南边行过，往叙利亚去，我们就在泰尔上岸，因为船要在那里卸货。船为什么停在泰尔？

4 找着了门徒，就在那里住了七天。保罗在寻找什么人？他们被圣灵感动，对保罗说：「不要上耶路撒冷去。」这些门徒对保罗有什么劝告？

5 过了这几天，我们就起身前行。他们众人同妻子儿女，送我们到城外，我们都跪在岸上祷告，彼此辞别。哪些人来向保罗告别？

6 我们上了船，他们就回家去了。在分别之前，他们做了什么？

7 We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day. What happened in Ptolemais? 

8 Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. Whose house did he stay at? What do you remember about Philip? (Hint: Acts 8:26-40) 

9 He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. What abilities did Philip's 4 unmarried daughter have?

10 After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. What do remember about Agabus 15 years earlier? (Hint Acts 11:27-29.) 

11 Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’” What was Agabus telling would happen to Paul if he went to Jerusalem?

7 我们从泰尔行尽了水路，来到多利买，就问那里的弟兄安，和他们同住了一天。在多利买发生了什么事？

8 第二天，我们离开那里，来到凯撒利亚，就进了传福音的腓利家里，和他同住。他是那七个执事里的一个。保罗住在谁的家里？你还记得关于腓利的事吗？（提示，使徒行传11:27-29）

9 他有四个女儿，都是处女，是说预言的。腓利的四个女儿有什么能力？

10 我们在那里多住了几天，有一个先知，名叫亚迦布，从犹太下来，我们还记得15年前的亚迦布吗？（提示，使徒行传11:27-29）

11 到了我们这里，就拿保罗的腰带捆上自己的手脚，说：「圣灵说：犹太人在耶路撒冷，要如此捆绑这腰带的主人，把他交在外邦人手里。」亚迦布对保罗上耶路撒冷的事说了什么？

12 When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. Why do you think the people believed Agabus? 

13 Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” What was Paul's response? 

14 When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be done.” How did Paul conclude the discussion?

15 After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem. 16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. Where did Paul and his companions find hospitality? He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples. When do you think Mnason might have met Paul?

12 我们和那本地的人听见这话，都苦劝保罗不要上耶路撒冷去。你认为人们为什么会相信亚迦布的话？

13 保罗说：「你们为什么这样痛哭，使我心碎呢？我为主耶稣的名，不但被人捆绑，就是死在耶路撒冷也是愿意的。」保罗是如何回应的？

14 保罗既不听劝，我们便住了口，只说：「愿主的旨意成就」，便了。保罗是如何结束这场讨论的？

15 过了几日，我们收拾行李上耶路撒冷去。16 有凯撒利亚的几个门徒和我们同去，带我们到一个久为门徒的家里，叫我们与他同住；保罗和同伴们在哪里住宿？他名叫拿孙，是塞浦路斯人。你认为拿孙曾在什么时候遇见的保罗？

###### Notes: 注释

Prophesied - This gift is having the ability to speak and teach what God has revealed in His Word.. In 1 Corinthians 14:1 Paul tells the believers to strive for this gift of prophecy, and goes on to rate it far above the gift of speaking in tongues. "He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified." 1 Corinthians 14:5.

说预言 - 这是神的恩赐，就是可以传讲神在祂话语里的启示。在哥林多前书14:1，保罗告诉信徒要切慕这样说预言（中文圣经译为讲道）的恩赐，并且认为这比说方言更强。因为说方言的，若不翻出来，使教会被造就，那作先知讲道的，就比他强了。（哥林多前书14:5）

Prophet -Receives revelations from God about the future.

先知 - 从神那里领受关于未来的启示。

###### Paul’s Arrival at Jerusalem 保罗抵达耶路撒冷

17 When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly. How was Paul greeted? 

18 The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. 19 Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. Why did Paul want to meet with James and the elders?

20 When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. What problem is being discussed? Is it wrong for the Jews to continue to follow Jewish customs? 

21 They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. Is this what Paul told the Jews? What did Paul tell the Jews in regard to the Gentiles?  

22 What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come, 23 so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow. 24 Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. How is Paul going to show that he is not insisting that Jews give up their customs?  Then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law. Why is this going to be done publically? 

25 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.” What had been sent to the Gentiles?

26 The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them. How do we know if Paul agreed to the plan?


17 到了耶路撒冷，弟兄们欢欢喜喜地接待我们。保罗受到了怎样的接待？

18 第二天，保罗同我们去见雅各；长老们也都在那里。19 保罗问了他们安，便将　神用他传教，在外邦人中间所行之事，一一地述说了。保罗为什么要去见雅各和长老们？

20 他们听见，就归荣耀与　神，对保罗说：「兄台，你看犹太人中信主的有多少万，并且都为律法热心。他们讨论了什么事？犹太人继续遵行犹太习俗是错误的吗？

21 他们听见人说，你教训一切在外邦的犹太人离弃摩西，对他们说，不要给孩子行割礼，也不要遵行条规。这是保罗对犹太人所传讲的吗？保罗对犹太人讲了那些关乎外邦人的事？

22 众人必听见你来了，这可怎么办呢？23 你就照着我们的话行吧！我们这里有四个人，都有愿在身。24 你带他们去，与他们一同行洁净的礼，替他们拿出规费，叫他们得以剃头。保罗将怎样证明他并没有坚持要犹太人放弃他们的习俗的？这样，众人就可知道，先前所听见你的事都是虚的；并可知道，你自己为人，循规蹈矩，遵行律法。为什么这事要公开做？

25 至于信主的外邦人，我们已经写信拟定，叫他们谨忌那祭偶像之物，和血，并勒死的牲畜，与奸淫。」他们给外邦人带去了什么？

26 于是保罗带着那四个人，第二天与他们一同行了洁净的礼，进了殿，报明洁净的日期满足，只等祭司为他们各人献祭。我们如何知道保罗是否同意这个计划？

###### Notes: 注释

Purification rites - The time had come for the men to complete their vow. They were required to purify themselves by having the priest bring sacrifices in the temple. When this was done, they would have their hair cut and the priest would take the hair and burn t on the altar. Paul was asked to the assume the expense of the animals for the sacrifices

洁净的礼 - 这是人们许愿结束的时候。他们需要到圣殿里由祭司献祭来洁净自己。在这之后他们要剃头，祭司把他们的头发烧在坛上。保罗被要求承担献祭所需的祭牲的费用。

######  Paul Arrested 保罗被捕

27 When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. What was almost over in seven days? Why were Jews in Jerusalem at this time? They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, 28 shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place. How did these Jews stir up the people? And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” 29 (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.) On what did the Jews base their charge?


27 那七日将完，从亚细亚来的犹太人看见保罗在殿里，什么事将在这七天里结束?犹太人为什么这时在耶路撒冷？就耸动了众人，下手拿他，

28 喊叫说：「以色列人来帮助，这就是在各处教训众人糟践我们百姓和律法，并这地方的。这些犹太人是怎样耸动众人的？他又带着希腊人进殿，污秽了这圣地。」

（29 这话是因他们曾看见以弗所人特罗非摩同保罗在城里，以为保罗带他进了殿。）犹太人根据什么来控告保罗的？

30 The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut. What happened to Paul? 

31 While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. Who heard about the riot? 

32 He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. What happened when the Roman troops showed up?

33 The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. Why did the troops  arrest Paul? 

34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. Why couldn't the crowd agree on a charge? Why was Paul taken to the barracks? 

35 When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers. 36 The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!” What did the crowd want?

30 合城都震动，百姓一齐跑来，拿住保罗，拉他出殿，殿门立刻都关了。保罗遭遇了什么了

31 他们正想要杀他，有人报信给营里的千夫长说：「耶路撒冷合城都乱了。」谁得到了骚乱的信息？

32 千夫长立时带着兵丁和几个百夫长，跑下去到他们那里。他们见了千夫长和兵丁，就止住不打保罗。当罗马兵丁赶到后发生了什么？

33 于是千夫长上前拿住他，吩咐用两条铁链捆锁；又问他是什么人，做的是什么事。兵丁为什么逮捕保罗？

34 众人有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的；千夫长因为这样乱嚷，得不着实情，就吩咐人将保罗带进营楼去。为什么众人不能一致的控告？保罗为什么被带到营楼里？

35 到了台阶上，众人挤得凶猛，兵丁只得将保罗抬起来。36 众人跟在后面，喊着说：「除掉他！」人们想要怎样？

###### Notes:  注释

Brought him into the temple - Gentiles were allowed only in the Court of the Gentiles. This court was divided from the areas reserved for Jewish worshipers, and the Court of the Men and the Court of the Women. Dividing these areas from the Court of the Gentiles was a marble screen. Inscriptions on this screen strictly forbade the Gentiles to enter the other Courts under the penalty of death.To the devout Jews, defiling the temple by bringing the Greeks into the forbidden areas was sacrilegious, or the worst crime possible.

带他进了殿 - 外邦人只准进外邦人院。外邦人院与犹太敬拜者区以及女院由大理石屏风隔离开。在墙面上铭刻严禁外邦人进入其它区域，否则将治死。对于虔诚的犹太人来说，带希腊人进入禁止的区域是污秽圣殿，亵渎神，或是最糟糕的罪行。

The barracks - was named Antonia by King Herod in honor of his supporter, Mark Anthony. At each corner was a tower, 30 meters (100 feet) tall permitting Roman authorities to look down upon the temple complex for surveillance. In addition to being a barracks, the fortress contained many apartments, baths, and courtyards. At times it served as a royal palace. There were two sets of stairs connecting the fortress with the temple.

营楼 - 被希律王命名为安东尼楼，为要纪念他的支持者马可安东尼。每个角上都有一座30米（100英尺）高塔，可以使罗马人监视圣殿里的动向。除了作为营楼之外，里面还建有住处、澡堂、庭院。当时这里作为宫殿。有两处台阶连接圣殿和营楼。

###### Paul Speaks to the Crowd 保罗为自己辩护

37 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?”
“Do you speak Greek?” he replied. 

38 “Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?” Who did the commander think Paul was?

39 Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people.” What was Paul's request?

40 After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic
In what language did Paul address the crowd?

37 将要带他进营楼，保罗对千夫长说：「我对你说句话可以不可以？」他说：「你懂得希腊话吗？

38 你莫非是从前作乱、带领四千凶徒往旷野去的那埃及人吗？」千夫长认为保罗是什么人？

39 保罗说：「我本是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，并不是无名小城的人。求你准我对百姓说话。」保罗有什么要求？

40 千夫长准了。保罗就站在台阶上，向百姓摆手，他们都静默无声，保罗便用希伯来话对他们说：保罗用什么语言对众人说话？

###### Notes: 注释

The Egyptian - Shortly before this time an Egyptian who was a radical anti-Roman revolutionary, let many of his followers out of Jerusalem to the Mt. of Olives with the promise that he could cause the walls of the city to collapse. The Romans killed 400 and captured 200, however the Egyptian escaped.

那埃及人 - 在此不久前，有一个埃及人是一个激进的反对罗马的革命者，他驱使很多跟随者聚集在耶路撒冷城外的橄榄山上，许诺他将使城墙倒塌。罗马人杀害了400人，捉住了200人，但是那埃及人逃脱了。
