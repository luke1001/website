##### Acts 11:1-30  使徒行传 11:1-30

It can be seen that news of what happened at Caesarea spread throughout Judea. As soon as Peter returned from his trip to Caesarea, however, he was sharply criticized.

我们看到在凯撒利亚发生的事传遍了犹太地。彼得刚从凯撒利亚返回即遭到严厉的批评。

###### Peter Explains His Actions 彼得解释他的行为

1 The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him 3 and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.” Why would this question surprise you? What did the circumcised believers believe? (Hint: Think about Jesus death and resurrection.)

4 Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: 5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. 6 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. 7 Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’8 “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’9 “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ 10 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again. 11 “Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. 12 The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. 13 He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. 14 He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’15 “As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. 16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 17 So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?” What did Peter remember?

18 When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.” What was the change in attitude toward the Gentile Christians?

1 使徒和在犹太的众弟兄听说外邦人也领受了　神的道。2 及至彼得上了耶路撒冷，那些奉割礼的门徒和他争辩说：3 「你进入未受割礼之人的家和他们一同吃饭了。」这个问题可能会使你感到惊讶的原因是什么？奉割礼的门徒相信什么？（提示：思考耶稣的受难和复活）

4 彼得就开口把这事挨次给他们讲解说：5 「我在约帕城里祷告的时候，魂游象外，看见异象，有一物降下，好像一块大布，系着四角，从天缒下，直来到我跟前。6 我定睛观看，见内中有地上四足的牲畜和野兽、昆虫，并天上的飞鸟。7 我且听见有声音向我说：『彼得，起来，宰了吃！』8 我说：『主啊，这是不可的！凡俗而不洁净的物从来没有入过我的口。』9 第二次，有声音从天上说：『　神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。』10 这样一连三次，就都收回天上去了。11 正当那时，有三个人站在我们所住的房门前，是从凯撒利亚差来见我的。12 圣灵吩咐我和他们同去，不要疑惑。同着我去的，还有这六位弟兄，我们都进了那人的家。13 那人就告诉我们，他如何看见一位天使站在他屋里，说：『你打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来，14 他有话告诉你，可以叫你和你的全家得救。』15 我一开讲，圣灵便降在他们身上，正像当初降在我们身上一样。16 我就想起主的话说：『约翰是用水施洗，但你们要受圣灵的洗。』17 神既然给他们恩赐，像在我们信主耶稣基督的时候给了我们一样；我是谁，能拦阻　神呢？」彼得想起了什么？

18 众人听见这话，就不言语了，只归荣耀与　神，说：「这样看来，　神也赐恩给外邦人，叫他们悔改得生命了。」众人对外邦信徒的态度有什么样的变化？

###### Notes: 注释

Uncircumcised men - The Gentiles would not observe the laws of clean and unclean food and would violate Jewish regulations concerning food preparation.

未受割礼之人– 外邦人不曾遵守有关洁净和食物的律法，因此他们触犯了犹太人饮食的饮食禁忌。

###### The Church in Antioch 安提阿的教会

19 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. Who did the Jewish community talk to about Jesus resurrection?

20 Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. Who else was finally receiving the good news about Jesus? When did we learn of another man from Cyrene? (Hint: Luke 23:26) 

21 The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. 22 News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. What do you remember about Barnabas? (Hint: Acts 4:36-37, Acts 9:26-27) 

23 When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. 24 He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord. What else do we learn about Barnabas?

25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 26 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. Why was Saul in Taurus?So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. How long did Barnabas and Saul work together in Antioch? Why would they stay so long? The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. What new name were the followers of Jesus given?

27 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) Where would the famine spread? 

29 The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. 30 This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul. How did the believers living in Antioch help the believers in Jerusalem?


19 那些因司提反的事遭患难四散的门徒直走到腓尼基和塞浦路斯，并安提阿；他们不向别人讲道，只向犹太人讲。犹太门徒向哪些人传讲耶稣的复活？

20 但内中有塞浦路斯和古利奈人，他们到了安提阿也向希腊人传讲主耶稣。还有哪些人也听到了关于耶稣的福音？我们还在何处学到了另外一个古利奈人（提示:路加福音23:26）

21 主与他们同在，信而归主的人就很多了。22 这风声传到耶路撒冷教会人的耳中，他们就打发巴拿巴出去，走到安提阿为止。你还记得哪些关于巴拿巴的事？（提示:使徒行传4:36-37,使徒行传9:26-27）

23 他到了那里，看见　神所赐的恩就欢喜，劝勉众人，立定心志，恒久靠主。24 这巴拿巴原是个好人，被圣灵充满，大有信心。于是有许多人归服了主。我们学到哪些关乎巴拿巴的事？

25 他又往大数去找扫罗，26 找着了，就带他到安提阿去。扫罗为什么在大数？他们足有一年的工夫和教会一同聚集，教训了许多人。巴拿巴和扫罗一起在安提阿工作了多久？为什么他们在那里停留这么久？门徒称为「基督徒」是从安提阿起首。跟随耶稣的人被称为什么？

27 当那些日子，有几位先知从耶路撒冷下到安提阿。28 内中有一位，名叫亚迦布，站起来，借着圣灵指明天下将有大饥荒。（这事到克劳第年间果然有了。）饥荒将在哪里发生？

29 于是门徒定意照各人的力量捐钱，送去供给住在犹太的弟兄。30 他们就这样行，把捐项托巴拿巴和扫罗送到众长老那里。居住在安提阿的信徒是如何帮助在耶路撒冷的信徒的？

###### Notes: 注释

Antioch - Antioch, located in Syria, was considered the third most important city of the Roman Empire, after Rome and Alexandria. The combination of sea trade and desert trade on a constant east west flow, along with the political power seat placed there made the city's growth unrestrained. There were many impressive public buildings and also a reputation for gambling and prostitution. Caesar Augustus built a circus there seating 20,000 people and Herod the Great paved the main street of the city with white marble blocks for 4 kilometers (2.5 miles.) It was the only city whose streets were lighted at night, oil lamps being used. A large Jewish community lived there, having fled Jerusalem after Stephen's death, and converted many Greeks to proselytes of Judaism.


安提阿– 安提阿座落于叙利亚，被认为是罗马帝国中仅次于罗马和亚历山大的第三大重要城市。这里连接着东西方的海上和陆地贸易常年川流不息，同时政治的重要地位也使这座城市充满生机。这里有许多宏伟的公共建筑，也因赌博和妓院而闻名。凯撒奥古斯都建造的竞技场可容纳20,000名观众，大希律用白色大理石铺设了长达4公里(2.5英里) 的城市主干道。这是唯一一座在夜晚使用油灯为街道照明的城市。有很多犹太人在司提反殉道后逃离耶路撒冷，聚居在这里，并使很多希腊人转变而皈依犹太教信仰。

###### Cyrene - North African coastal city. 古利奈– 北非沿海的城市。

Claudius - was the fourth Roman emperor (41-54) The reign of Claudius included the invasion and conquest of Britain in 43 AD.

克劳第– 第四位罗马皇帝(41-54)，克劳第执政期间，公元43年，罗马侵略并征服了英国。
