##### Acts 20:1-38 使徒行传  20:1-38

Luke does not tell us much about the next portion of the third journey. Paul revisits the churches established in Macedonia and Greece (Achaia).Paul's plan to sail to Syria from Achaia was changed when he discovered that the Jews had made a plot against him. He decided to return by land.

路加并没有告诉我们很多关于第三次旅行余下的信息。保罗重访了在马其顿和希腊（亚该亚）建立的教会。保罗计划从亚该亚乘船往叙利亚去，但因为他预先知道了犹太人要密谋害他就改变了计划。他准备由陆路返回。

###### Through Macedonia and Greece 保罗再访问马其顿和希腊

1 When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia. What was the uproar about? 

2 He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece, 3 where he stayed three months. How long was Paul in Corinth? Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia. What caused Paul to change his plans? 

4 He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. Where were these men from?

5 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. Where did Paul send some of his traveling companions? 

6 But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days. Who else is with Paul?

1 乱定之后，保罗请门徒来，劝勉他们，就辞别起行，往马其顿去。扰乱的起因是什么？

2 走遍了那一带地方，用许多话劝勉门徒，然后来到希腊。3 在那里住了三个月，保罗在哥林多住了多久？将要坐船往叙利亚去，犹太人设计要害他，他就定意从马其顿回去。保罗改变计划的原因是什么？

4 同他到亚细亚去的，有庇哩亚人毕罗斯的儿子所巴特，帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和西公都，还有特庇人该犹，并提摩太，又有亚细亚人推基古和特罗非摩。这些人是从哪里来的？

5 这些人先走，在特罗亚等候我们。保罗打发他旅行的同伴去哪里？

6 过了除酵的日子，我们从腓立比开船，五天到了特罗亚，和他们相会，在那里住了七天。还有谁与保罗同行？

###### Eutychus Raised From the Dead at Troas  在特罗亚的犹推古从死里复活

7 On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Why did the people gather?  Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. How long had Paul been talking? 

8 There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting. 9 Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. Where was Eutychus sitting? When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. What just happened? 

10 Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!” What miracle did Paul perform? 11 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. How long did Paul stay? 12 The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.

7 七日的第一日，我们聚会擘饼的时候，大家为什么聚会？保罗因为要次日起行，就与他们讲论，直讲到半夜。保罗讲了多久？

8 我们聚会的那座楼上，有好些灯烛。9 有一个少年人，名叫犹推古，坐在窗台上，困倦沉睡。保罗讲了多时，犹推古坐在哪里？少年人睡熟了，就从三层楼上掉下去；扶起他来，已经死了。发生了什么事？

10 保罗下去，伏在他身上，抱着他，说：「你们不要发慌，他的灵魂还在身上。」保罗行了什么神迹？11 保罗又上去，擘饼，吃了，谈论许久，直到天亮，这才走了。保罗停留了多久？12 有人把那童子活活地领来，得的安慰不小。


###### Paul’s Farewell to the Ephesian Elders 保罗与以弗所的长老们告别

13 We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot. What had Paul decided?

14 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. 15 The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus. 16 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. Why did Paul decide to sail past Ephesus?

13 我们先上船，开往亚朔去，意思要在那里接保罗；因为他是这样安排的，他自己打算要步行。保罗做了什么决定？

14 他既在亚朔与我们相会，我们就接他上船，来到米推利尼。15 从那里开船，次日到了基阿的对面；又次日，在撒摩靠岸；又次日，来到米利都。16 乃因保罗早已定意越过以弗所，免得在亚细亚耽延，他急忙前走，巴不得赶五旬节能到耶路撒冷。保罗为什么不在亚细亚耽延？

17 From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. Who did Paul meet in Miletus? 

18 When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia. 19 I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents. What is Paul reminding the elders? 

20 You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house. 21 How has Paul taught the people? I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. Who has Paul taught? Why would Paul talk about how he spent his time with them?

22 “And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. Who is directing Paul to go to Jerusalem? 

23 I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me. What does Paul know lies ahead? 

24 However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying to the good news of God’s grace. What race is Paul speaking about?


17 保罗从米利都打发人往以弗所去，请教会的长老来。保罗在米利都与哪些人见面？

18 他们来了，保罗就说：「你们知道，自从我到亚细亚的日子以来，在你们中间始终为人如何，19 服事主，凡事谦卑，眼中流泪，又因犹太人的谋害，经历试炼。保罗提醒了长老们哪些事？

20 你们也知道，凡与你们有益的，我没有一样避讳不说的，或在众人面前，或在各人家里，我都教导你们；21保罗是怎样教导这些人的？ 又对犹太人和希腊人证明当向　神悔改，信靠我主耶稣基督。保罗向哪些人教导？保罗为什么要讲述他是如何在他们中间做工的？

22 现在我往耶路撒冷去，心甚迫切，不知道在那里要遇见什么事；谁在引导保罗向耶路撒冷去？

23 但知道圣灵在各城里向我指证，说有捆锁与患难等待我。保罗知道在前面等待他的是什么？

24 我却不以性命为念，也不看为宝贵，只要行完我的路程，成就我从主耶稣所领受的职事，证明　神恩惠的福音。  保罗所说的路程是指什么？

25 “Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again. What does Paul want the elders to know? 

26 Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you. What does Paul mean by verse 26? 

27 For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. What has Paul taught the elders from Ephesus? 

28 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood. What responsibility did these men have? 

29 I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. What is Paul's warning?  

30 Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them. Where will these distorters of truth come from?  

31 So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears. 32 “Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. What will God's Word give them? 

33 I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing. 34 You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions. How did Paul take care of his needs while he traveled? 

35 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ” Who must we help?

36 When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. How did Paul finish his meeting? 

37 They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. 38 What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. What grieved the men? Then they accompanied him to the ship.


25 「我素常在你们中间来往，传讲　神国的道；如今我晓得，你们以后都不得再见我的面了。保罗要长老们知道什么？

26 所以我今日向你们证明，你们中间无论何人死亡，罪不在我身上。保罗在26节说的是什么意思？

27 因为　神的旨意，我并没有一样避讳不传给你们的。保罗向以弗所来的长老们教导了什么？

28 圣灵立你们作全群的监督，你们就当为自己谨慎，也为全群谨慎，牧养　神的教会，就是他用自己血所买来的。这些人有哪些责任？

29 我知道，我去之后必有凶暴的豺狼进入你们中间，不爱惜羊群。保罗的警告是什么？

30 就是你们中间，也必有人起来说悖谬的话，要引诱门徒跟从他们。这些悖谬真理的话将从哪里来的？

31 所以你们应当警醒，记念我三年之久昼夜不住地流泪、劝戒你们各人。32 如今我把你们交托　神和他恩惠的道；这道能建立你们，叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。神的道将带给他们什么？

33 我未曾贪图一个人的金、银、衣服。34 我这两只手常供给我和同人的需用，这是你们自己知道的。保罗在旅行的时候是怎样供给自己的需要的？

35 我凡事给你们作榜样，叫你们知道应当这样劳苦，扶助软弱的人，又当记念主耶稣的话，说：『施比受更为有福。』」  我们应当帮助什么样的人？

36 保罗说完了这话，就跪下同众人祷告。保罗怎样结束这次见面的？

37 众人痛哭，抱着保罗的颈项，和他亲嘴。38 叫他们最伤心的，就是他说「以后不能再见我的面」那句话，什么使这些人感到伤心？于是送他上船去了。
