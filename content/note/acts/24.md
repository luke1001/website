##### Acts 24:1-27 使徒行传 24:1-27

Paul was kept in custody in Caesarea for two years. During that time he was on trial before Felix, the governor, and also before Festus, the successor to Felix. When Festus was faced with the problem of writing up the charges against Paul for Emperor Nero, he called upon King Agrippa II for consultation. In a very formal assembly of dignitaries, Paul addressed Agrippa for the purpose of showing his innocence of all the charges laid against him.  Agrippa and other concluded that Paul was innocent, but since Paul appealed to Caesar he would have to be sent to Rome.

保罗被关押在凯撒利亚两年。在这段时间里，他先后在巡抚腓力斯以及他的继任者波求·非斯都面前受审。保罗因为犹太人的控告，向非斯都要求上告于该撒的时候，非斯都与亚基帕王商议这件事。于是在许多尊贵人组成的议会面前，保罗向亚基帕王陈述自己的清白和所有针对他的不实指控。亚基帕王和其他人一致认为保罗是无辜的，但因他曾要求上告于凯撒，所以就把他送去罗马。

###### Paul’s Trial Before Felix 保罗在腓力斯面前受审

1 Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. Who came to Caesarea? 

2 When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. 3 Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. 4 But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. How would you describe this introduction?

5 “We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect 6 and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. What three charges did Tertullus make against Paul?  What do you notice about the third charge? 

[7 Some manuscripts include "and we would have judged him in accordance with our law. But the commander Lysias came and took him from us with much violence, ordering his accusers to comebefore you."] 8 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.” How does Tertullus say commander Lysias Interfered? What conclusion does Tertullus want Felix to make?

9 The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. What support does Tertullus get?

10 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Does Felix follow Tertullus advice, and examine Paul himself? What does Felix do? Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. How does Paul  not begin his defense? 

11 You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12 My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. What does Paul refute? 

13 And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. What does Paul want the governor to understand? 14 However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. Why was Paul at the temple? I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,  How does Paul live his life? 

15 and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. What does Paul further add? 

16 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. What is important to Paul?

17 “After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. Why does Paul explain he came to the temple? 

18 I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. What does Paul add about the situation? 

19 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. Who should be at the trial? Why? 

20 Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin— 21 unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’” To what does Paul admit?

22 Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. With what was Felix familiar? “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”When will the case be decided?  

23 He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. What courtesy was Paul given?

24 Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. What did Felix and Drusilla want? 

25 As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. Why do you think Felix was afraid? When I find it convenient, I will send for you.” 

26 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. What did Felix want from Paul?

27 When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison. For how long was Paul left in prison? Why did Felix leave Paul in prison?

1过了五天，大祭司亚拿尼亚同几个长老，和一个辩士帖土罗下来，向巡抚控告保罗。哪些人来到了凯撒利亚？

2保罗被提了来，帖土罗就告他说：3「腓力斯大人，我们因你得以大享太平，并且这一国的弊病，因着你的先见得以更正了；我们随时随地满心感谢不尽。4惟恐多说，你嫌烦絮，只求你宽容听我们说几句话。你怎样看这一段开始的陈述？

5我们看这个人，如同瘟疫一般，是鼓动普天下众犹太人生乱的，又是拿撒勒教党里的一个头目，6连圣殿他也想要污秽；我们把他捉住了。帖士罗告保罗哪三样事？你对这三样事有什么看法？（有古卷加：要按我们的律法审问，

7不料，千夫长吕西亚前来，甚是强横，从我们手中把他夺去，吩咐告他的人到你这里来。) 8你自己究问他，就可以知道我们告他的一切事了。」帖士罗是怎么叙述千夫长吕西亚的干涉的？帖士罗想让腓力斯做出什么结论？

9众犹太人也随着告他说：「事情诚然是这样。」帖士罗得到了哪些人的帮助？

10巡抚点头叫保罗说话。腓力斯是否听了帖士罗的话就自己判断保罗呢？腓力斯是怎么做的？他就说：「我知道你在这国里断事多年，所以我乐意为自己分诉。保罗是如何开始自己的辩护的？

11你查问就可以知道，从我上耶路撒冷礼拜到今日不过有十二天。12他们并没有看见我在殿里，或是在会堂里，或是在城里，和人辩论，耸动众人。保罗是如何驳斥的？

13他们现在所告我的事并不能对你证实了。保罗想让巡抚明白什么事？14但有一件事，我向你承认，就是他们所称为异端的道，保罗为什么会在圣殿里？我正按着那道事奉我祖宗的　神，又信合乎律法的和先知书上一切所记载的，保罗的生活是怎样的？

15并且靠着　神，盼望死人，无论善恶，都要复活，就是他们自己也有这个盼望。保罗还说明了什么？

16我因此自己勉励，对　神对人，常存无亏的良心。保罗看什么事是至关重要的？

17过了几年，我带着周济本国的捐项和供献的物上去。保罗为什么解释他去圣殿的原因？

18正献的时候，他们看见我在殿里已经洁净了，并没有聚众，也没有吵嚷，惟有几个从亚细亚来的犹太人。保罗对当时的情形还做了哪些说明？

19他们若有告我的事，就应当到你面前来告我。谁应当出席这次审判？为什么？

20即或不然，这些人若看出我站在公会前，有妄为的地方，他们自己也可以说明。21纵然有，也不过一句话，就是我站在他们中间大声说：『我今日在你们面前受审，是为死人复活的道理。』」保罗承认了什么？

22腓力斯本是详细晓得这道，腓力斯详细晓得什么？就支吾他们说：「且等千夫长吕西亚下来，我要审断你们的事。」这件事情将在什么时候判断？

23于是吩咐百夫长看守保罗，并且宽待他，也不拦阻他的亲友来供给他。保罗受到了什么优待？

24过了几天，腓力斯和他夫人—犹太的女子土西拉—一同来到，就叫了保罗来，听他讲论信基督耶稣的道。腓力斯和土西拉想要什么？

25保罗讲论公义、节制，和将来的审判。腓力斯甚觉恐惧，你认为腓力斯为什么会感到恐惧？说：「你暂且去吧，等我得便再叫你来。」

26腓力斯又指望保罗送他银钱，所以屡次叫他来，和他谈论。腓力斯想从保罗那里得什么？

27过了两年，波求·非斯都接了腓力斯的任；腓力斯要讨犹太人的喜欢，就留保罗在监里。保罗在监狱里待了多久，腓力斯为什么要把保罗留在监里？
