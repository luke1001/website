##### Acts 4:1-37  使徒行传 4:1-37 

Peter’s preaching attracted the attention of the temple priests, the captain of the temple’s security agents, and the Sadducees. They were all “greatly disturbed because the aposltles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.” The captain was second in authority to the high priest; he had charge of the Levitical police force of the temple. 

彼得的讲道引起圣殿里的祭司、守殿官和撒都该人的注意。他们因“使徒教训百姓，本着耶稣，传说死人复活，就很烦恼。”守殿官的权柄仅次于大祭司；他掌管守殿的利未人警力。

###### Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin  彼得、约翰在公会被查问 

1 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. 

2 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. Why were the priests, captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees disturbed? In whom did they not believe? 

3 They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. What would happen the next day? 

4 But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand. How many people heard the message and believed? 

5 The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. Why do you think they met? 

6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family. What do you remember about Annas? Caiaphas? 

7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or what name did you do this?” We have an idea about the education of the men questioning Peter and John. What were Peter’s and John’s education and occupation?Why would this be considered a trap for Peter and John? 

1 使徒对百姓说话的时候，祭司们和守殿官，并撒都该人忽然来了。

2 因他们教训百姓，本着耶稣，传说死人复活，就很烦恼，为什么祭司们和守殿官，并撒都该人感到烦恼呢？他们不信谁？

3于是下手拿住他们；因为天已经晚了，就把他们押到第二天。第二天会发生什么事？

4 但听道之人有许多信的，男丁数目约到五千。有多少人听道并且信了？ 

5 第二天，官府、长老，和文士在耶路撒冷聚会，你认为他们为什么聚会？

6 又有大祭司亚那和该亚法、约翰、亚历山大，并大祭司的亲族都在那里，你还记得亚那、该亚法吗？

7 叫使徒站在当中，就问他们说：「你们用什么能力，奉谁的名做这事呢？」我们可以看出问询彼得和约翰的人所受到的教育程度。彼得和约翰的教育程度如何，是做什么职业的呢？为什么说这可看作是对彼得和约翰所设的陷阱？ 

8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! What did it mean that Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit? 

9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, 10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. In whose name was the man healed? Why would this make the Jewish leaders angry? 

11 Jesus is “‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’ Explain vs. 11. Why would this further anger the leaders? 

12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.” How is salvation found? What else did the beggar receive besides physical healing

13 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. Read Matthew 10:19-20? What can we learn from this reading? 

14 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. 15 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. What do you remember about the Sanhedrin? 

16 “What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it. Why were they worried? 

17 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.” What was the plan to stop the disciples? 

那时彼得被圣灵充满，对他们说：彼得被圣灵充满是什么意思？

9 「治民的官府和长老啊，倘若今日因为在残疾人身上所行的善事查问我们他是怎么得了痊愈，10 你们众人和以色列百姓都当知道，站在你们面前的这人得痊愈是因你们所钉十字架、　神叫他从死里复活的拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名。这个人是因谁的名得医治的？为什么这会使犹太人的官长生气呢？

11 他是你们匠人所弃的石头，已成了房角的头块石头。请解释11节的含义。为什么这会更加激怒那些官长？

12 除他以外，别无拯救；因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。」救恩建立在什么基础上？那个求周济的人除了身体得医治外还得到了什么？

13 他们见彼得、约翰的胆量，又看出他们原是没有学问的小民，就希奇，认明他们是跟过耶稣的；阅读马太福音 10:19-20？我们可以从中学到什么？

14 又看见那治好了的人和他们一同站着，就无话可驳。15 于是吩咐他们从公会出去，就彼此商议说：我们还记得哪些关于公会的事？

16 「我们当怎样办这两个人呢？因为他们诚然行了一件明显的神迹，凡住耶路撒冷的人都知道，我们也不能说没有。他们为什么事而感到烦恼？

17 惟恐这事越发传扬在民间，我们必须恐吓他们，叫他们不再奉这名对人讲论。」他们阻止使徒的计划是什么？

18 Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him? You be the judges! 

20 As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”What was Peter and John’s response to the Sanhedrin plan? What else could the Sanhedrin have done? 21 After further threats they let them go. What happened to Peter and John? They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. What made it difficult to punish the disciples? 22 For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. For how long was the man crippled? 

18 于是叫了他们来，禁止他们总不可奉耶稣的名讲论教训人。19 彼得、约翰说：「听从你们，不听从　神，这在　神面前合理不合理，你们自己酌量吧！彼得和约翰是怎样回应公会的？公会还能做什么？

20 我们所看见所听见的，不能不说。」21 官长为百姓的缘故，想不出法子刑罚他们，又恐吓一番，把他们释放了。彼得和约翰的结果怎样？这是因众人为所行的奇事都归荣耀与　神。为什么难以刑罚使徒？22 原来借着神迹医好的那人有四十多岁了。这个人瘸了多久？

###### The Believers Pray 门徒的祷告 

23 On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them. Why would Peter and John report this? 

24 When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. Who is “they” in vs. 24? To whom did the disciples pray? “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. 25 You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: Who gave King David the power to speak about God and the coming of Jesus? “‘Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 26 The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed one. (Taken from Psalm 2:1-2.) What had David prophesied? 

23 二人既被释放，就到会友那里去，把祭司长和长老所说的话都告诉他们。彼得和约翰会为什么要述说这些？

24 他们听见了，就同心合意地高声向　神说：24节中的“他们”指谁？门徒向谁祷告？「主啊！你是造天、地、海，和其中万物的，25 你曾借着圣灵，托你仆人—我们祖宗大卫的口，说：谁赐给大卫王能力可以讲说神的事和耶稣的来临？ 外邦为什么争闹？ 万民为什么谋算虚妄的事？ 26 世上的君王一齐起来， 臣宰也聚集， 要敌挡主， 并主的受膏者。[引用自诗篇 2:1-2]大卫做了怎样的预言？

27 Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. What had Herod, Pilate and the Jewish people done? 

28 They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. 29 Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. What did the disciples ask of God? 30 Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”What else did they ask of God?What didn’t they ask of God? 

31 After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. What gift of God were they given? What is the Word of God? 

27 希律和本丢·彼拉多，外邦人和以色列民，果然在这城里聚集，要攻打你所膏的圣仆耶稣，希律、彼拉多和以色列民做了什么？

28 成就你手和你意旨所预定必有的事。29–30 他们恐吓我们，现在求主鉴察，一面叫你仆人大放胆量讲你的道，门徒向神求什么？一面伸出你的手来医治疾病，并且使神迹奇事因着你圣仆耶稣的名行出来。」他们还向神求什么？他们没有向神求什么？

31 祷告完了，聚会的地方震动，他们就都被圣灵充满，放胆讲论　神的道。神赐给他们什么恩赐？神的道是什么？

###### The Believers Share Their Possessions 信徒分享自己的财产 

32 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. Who is the real owner of all that we posses? How did the people show their faith? 

33 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. What was the disciples main message? And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all 34 that there were no needy persons among them. What was the result of the sharing of goods? For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales 35 and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need. 36 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”), 37 sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet. Why was it unusual for Joseph or Barnabas to sell a field he owned? We will learn more of Barnabas in Acts 11:22, 25, 30. 

32 那许多信的人都是一心一意的，没有一人说他的东西有一样是自己的，都是大家公用。谁是我们所有财产的真正主人？人们怎样见证他们的信心的？

33 使徒大有能力，见证主耶稣复活；使徒传讲的主要信息是什么？众人也都蒙大恩。34 内中也没有一个缺乏的；分享财产的结果是什么？因为人人将田产房屋都卖了，把所卖的价银拿来，35 放在使徒脚前，照各人所需用的，分给各人。36有一个利未人，生在塞浦路斯，名叫约瑟，使徒称他为巴拿巴（巴拿巴翻出来就是劝慰子）。37 他有田地，也卖了，把价银拿来，放在使徒脚前。约瑟或巴拿巴卖了自己的田地有什么特别之处？我们会在使徒行传11:22,25,30 里学到更多关于巴拿巴的事。
