##### Acts 10:1-48 使徒行传 10:1-48

In Acts chapter 8, Philip brought the saving Gospel to a man from Ethiopia. In chapter 9 Peter brought Tabitha/Dorcas back to life and stayed with a tanner, a Gentile. In chapter 10, Peter will be asked to fully embrace the Gentiles. The forgiving grace of God in Christ was for non-Jews as well as for Jews.

在使徒行传8章，腓利把得救的福音传给了一个衣索匹亚人。在第9章彼得使大比大/多加复活并且和一个外邦硝皮匠住在一起。在第10章，彼得将要完全的接纳外邦人。从神而来在基督里面赦罪的恩典临到外邦人中就如同犹太人一样。

###### Cornelius Calls for Peter 哥尼流邀请彼得

1 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. 2 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. What do we learn about Cornelius and his family? What does it mean to be devout? 

3 One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!” Who appeared to Cornelius?

4 Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. How did Cornelius answer the Lord? The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. 5 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.” What instructions did the angel give to Cornelius?

7 When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. 8 He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. How did Cornelius respond to the angel's instructions? Why was it necessary to have a soldier go with them?


1 在凯撒利亚有一个人，名叫哥尼流，是「意大利营」的百夫长。2 他是个虔诚人，他和全家都敬畏　神，多多周济百姓，常常祷告　神。我们对哥尼流和他的家庭有哪些了解？虔诚是什么意思？

3 有一天，约在申初，他在异象中明明看见　神的一个使者进去，到他那里，说：「哥尼流。」什么向哥尼流显现？

4 哥尼流定睛看他，惊怕说：「主啊，什么事呢？」哥尼流是怎样回应主的？天使说：「你的祷告和你的周济达到　神面前，已蒙记念了。5 现在你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来。6 他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里，房子在海边上。」天使给哥尼流什么指示？

7 向他说话的天使去后，哥尼流叫了两个家人和常伺候他的一个虔诚兵来，8 把这事都述说给他们听，就打发他们往约帕去。哥尼流是如何回应天使的指示的？为什么需要士兵与他们同行？

###### Peter’s Vision 彼得的异象

9 About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. Why was Peter on the roof? 10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. What happened on vs. 10? 

11 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. 12 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds. 13 Then a voice told him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.” What did God ask of Peter?

14 “Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.” Why did Peter refuse? 15 The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.” What was God trying to tell Peter?

16 This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. Why three times?

17 While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. 18 They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. Who arrived at Simon the tanner's house?

19 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three men are looking for you. 20 So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.” What else did God tell Simon?

21 Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?”22 The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.” What message did the men give to Peter? 

23 Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. How did Peter show hospitality?


9 第二天，他们行路将近那城。彼得约在午正，上房顶去祷告，为什么彼得在房顶上10 觉得饿了，想要吃。那家的人正预备饭的时候，彼得魂游象外，在第10节发生了什么事？

11 看见天开了，有一物降下，好像一块大布，系着四角，缒在地上，12 里面有地上各样四足的走兽和昆虫，并天上的飞鸟；13 又有声音向他说：「彼得，起来，宰了吃！」神要彼得做什么？

14 彼得却说：「主啊，这是不可的！凡俗物和不洁净的物，我从来没有吃过。」彼得为什么拒绝？15 第二次有声音向他说：「　神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。」神要告诉彼得什么？

16 这样一连三次，那物随即收回天上去了。为什么是三次？

17 彼得心里正在猜疑之间，不知所看见的异象是什么意思。哥尼流所差来的人已经访问到西门的家，站在门外，18 喊着问：「有称呼彼得的西门住在这里没有？」谁到了硝皮匠西门的家？

19 彼得还思想那异象的时候，圣灵向他说：「有三个人来找你。20 起来，下去，和他们同往，不要疑惑，因为是我差他们来的。」神还对西门说了什么？

21 于是彼得下去见那些人，说：「我就是你们所找的人。你们来是为什么缘故？」22 他们说：「百夫长哥尼流是个义人，敬畏　神，为犹太通国所称赞。他蒙一位圣天使所指示，叫他请你到他家里去，听你的话。」这些人带给彼得什么信息？

23 彼得就请他们进去，住了一宿。彼得是怎么款待这些人的？


###### Notes: 注释：

Noon - One of the regular hours of prayer.

午正– 每日固定的祷告时间之一。

###### Peter at Cornelius’s House 彼得在哥尼流家中

The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along. Who else went with Peter? 

24 The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. Who had Cornelius invited? 

25 As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. 26 But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.” What did Peter want to make clear?

27 While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. 28 He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean. What barrier had been removed? 

29 So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?”

30 Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me 31 and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. 32 Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ 33 So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.” Why were Cornelius and his household gathered?


次日，起身和他们同去，还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去；还有谁和彼得同去？

24 又次日，他们进入凯撒利亚，哥尼流已经请了他的亲属密友等候他们。哥尼流邀请了谁？

25 彼得一进去，哥尼流就迎接他，俯伏在他脚前拜他。26 彼得却拉他，说：「你起来，我也是人。」彼得要讲明什么？

27 彼得和他说着话进去，见有好些人在那里聚集，28 就对他们说：「你们知道，犹太人和别国的人亲近来往本是不合例的，但　神已经指示我，无论什么人都不可看作俗而不洁净的。去除了怎样的障碍？

29 所以我被请的时候，就不推辞而来。现在请问：你们叫我来有什么意思呢？」

30 哥尼流说：「前四天，这个时候，我在家中守着申初的祷告，忽然有一个人穿着光明的衣裳，站在我面前，31 说：『哥尼流，你的祷告已蒙垂听，你的周济达到　神面前已蒙记念了。32 你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来，他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。』33 所以我立时打发人去请你。你来了很好；现今我们都在　神面前，要听主所吩咐你的一切话。」为什么哥尼流和他的家人一起聚集？

34 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism 35 but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. What had Peter come to realize? 

36 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. 37 You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. With what were the listeners familiar?

39 “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, 40 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. Why was it important to tell them God raised Jesus? 

41 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. What did Peter want Cornelius's household to understand? 43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” What would believers receive?

44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. 45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. 46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. How did God show these people believed? Then Peter said, 

47 “Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. Who might stand in the way? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” 

48 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days. Why ask Peter to stay?

34 彼得就开口说：「我真看出　神是不偏待人。35 原来，各国中那敬畏主、行义的人都为主所悦纳。彼得明白了什么？

36 神借着耶稣基督（他是万有的主）传和平的福音，将这道赐给以色列人。37 这话在约翰宣传洗礼以后，从加利利起，传遍了犹太。38 神怎样以圣灵和能力膏拿撒勒人耶稣，这都是你们知道的。他周流四方，行善事，医好凡被魔鬼压制的人，因为　神与他同在。听得人都熟悉哪些事？

39 他在犹太人之地，并耶路撒冷所行的一切事，有我们作见证。他们竟把他挂在木头上杀了。40 第三日，　神叫他复活，显现出来；为什么告诉他们神使耶稣复活这件事如此重要？

41不是显现给众人看，乃是显现给　神预先所拣选为他作见证的人看，就是我们这些在他从死里复活以后和他同吃同喝的人。42 他吩咐我们传道给众人，证明他是　神所立定的，要作审判活人、死人的主。彼得想要哥尼流全家明白什么？

43 众先知也为他作见证说：『凡信他的人必因他的名得蒙赦罪。』」信的人将得到什么？

44 彼得还说这话的时候，圣灵降在一切听道的人身上。45 那些奉割礼、和彼得同来的信徒，见圣灵的恩赐也浇在外邦人身上，就都希奇；46 因听见他们说方言，称赞　神为大。神怎样显明这些人信了？

47 于是彼得说：「这些人既受了圣灵，与我们一样，谁能禁止用水给他们施洗呢？」什么人可能会来禁止？

48 就吩咐奉耶稣基督的名给他们施洗。他们又请彼得住了几天。为什么要请彼得住下来？
