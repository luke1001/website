##### Acts 5:1-42 使徒行传 5：1-42 

The first Christian congregation’s members at Jerusalem were eager in their knowledge of Jesus. They assembled daily to hear the Word of God, offered up prayers and partook of the Lord’s Supper. In this chapter we will read about a couple who professed to believe in Jesus did. 

耶路撒冷的第一个基督教教会的会众们都急切地要认识主耶稣。他们每天都聚会来学习神的话语，祷告和领圣餐。在这一章中我们会读到一对公开宣信主耶稣的夫妇。

###### Ananias and Sapphira 亚拿尼亚和撒非喇 

1 Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. What had Ananias and Sapphira decided? 2 With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet. How did Ananias try to deceive the apostles? What had entered into the heart of Ananias? Who does this remind you of? 

5:1有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，同他的妻子撒非喇，卖了田产。亚拿尼亚和撒非喇做了什么决定？5:2 把价银私自留下几分，他的妻子也知道，其余的几分，拿来放在使徒脚前。亚拿尼亚是如何企图要欺骗使徒的？什么入了亚拿尼亚的心？这会让你想到谁？ 

3 Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? What knowledge did Peter have? 4 Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? What sin(s) had Ananias committed? You have not lied just to human beings but to God.” Who had they actually tried to deceive? 

5:3彼得说，亚拿尼亚为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，把田地的价银私自留下几分呢？彼得知道什么？5:4田地还没有卖，不是你自己的吗？既卖了，价银不是你作主吗？你怎么心里起这意念呢？亚拿尼亚犯了什么罪？你不是欺哄人，是欺哄神了。他们其实是欺骗了谁？ 

5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. What was God trying to tell the people? 6 Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. What took place? 

5:5亚拿尼亚听见这话，就仆倒断了气。听见的人都甚惧怕。神这是要告诉人们什么？5:6有些少年人起来，把他包裹抬出去埋葬了。发生了什么事？ 

7 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Why do you think Sapphira came? 

8 Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?” What was Peter giving Sapphira? “Yes,” she said, “that is the price.”What did Sapphira decide? 

9 Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Of what sin(s) did Sapphira commit? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.” What did Peter announce? 

10 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 11 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. What does “great fear” mean? 

5:7约过了三小时，他的妻子进来，还不知道这事。你认为撒非喇为什么进来？

5:8彼得对她说，你告诉我，你们卖田地的价银，就是这些吗？彼得这是在给她什么？她说，就是这些。撒非喇是如何决定的（回应的）？

5:9彼得说，你们为什么同心试探主的灵呢？撒非喇犯了什么罪？埋葬你丈夫之人的脚，已到门口，他们也要把你抬出去。彼得宣布了什么？

5:10妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前，断了气。那些少年人进来，见她已经死了，就抬出去，埋在她丈夫旁边。5:11 全 教 会 ， 和 听 见 这 事 的 人 ， 都 甚 惧 怕 。“甚惧怕”指的是什么意思？

###### The Apostles Heal Many 使徒们医好许多病人 

12 The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. What do you think these signs and wonders were? And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade. Where were the believers meeting? 

13 No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. 

14 Who do you think the highly regarded people were that failed to join them? Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. Of whom were the people not afraid? 

15 As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. 16 Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed. Where did the sick come from? 

5:12 主借使徒的手，在民间行了许多神迹奇事，你认为都是些什么样的神迹奇事？（他们（或作信的人）都同心合意地在所罗门的廊下。信徒们在哪里聚会？


5:13 其余的人，没有一个敢贴近他们。百姓却尊重他们。你认为那些德高望重的却没能加入他们的人们是谁？

5:14 信而归主的人越发增添，连男带女很多）。这些人不惧怕谁？

5:15 甚至有人将病人抬到街上，放在床上，或褥子上，指望彼得过来的时候，或者得他的影儿照在什么人身上。5:16 还有许多人，带着病人，和被污鬼缠磨的，从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来，全都得了医治。病人来自哪里？

###### The Apostles Persecuted 使徒们受逼迫 

17 Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. Why would there be jealousy? 

18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. It is thought that all 12 of the apostles were put in jail. 19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. How were the apostles released? 

20 “Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about this new life.” What were the disciples to do when they were released? 

21 At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. Why had the Sanhedrin gathered? 

22 But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, What had the officers found when they went to the jail? 

23 “We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” 24 On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to. Why were the captain and the temple guard nervous? 

5:17大祭司和他的一切同人，就是撒都该教门的人，都起来，满心忌恨为什么会有忌恨？

5:18就下手拿住使徒，收在外监。（通常被认为）所有12个使徒都被投入了监狱。5:19但主的使者，夜间开了监门，领他们出来，使徒们是如何被放出来的？

5:20说，你们去站在殿里，把这生命的道，都讲给百姓听。被放出来之后他们要做什么事情？

5:21使徒听了这话，天将亮的时候，就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了，叫齐公会的人，和以色列族的众长老，就差人到监里去，要把使徒提出来。犹太公会为什么聚集了起来？

5:22但差役到了，不见他们在监里，就回来禀报说，差役到监里发现了什么？

5:23我们看见监牢关得极妥当，看守的人也站在门外，及至开了门，里面一个人都不见。5:24守殿官和祭司长听见这话，心里犯难，不知这事将来如何。为什么守殿官会紧张？

25 Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.” What was reported? 

26 At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. Why would the people stone them? 

27 The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. 28 “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”Read Matthew 27:24-25.What had members of the Sanhedrin forgot? 

5:25有一个人来禀报说，你们收在监里的人，现在站在殿里教训百姓。有人来禀报了什么？

5:26于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来，并没有用强暴。因为怕百姓用石头打他们。百姓为什么会用石头打他们？

5:27带到了，便叫使徒站在公会前，大祭司问他们说，5:28我们不是严严地禁止你们，不可奉这名教训人吗？你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷，想要叫这人的血归到我们身上。请读马太福音27：24-25.这些犹太公会的人忘记了什么？

29 Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings! 30 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. What is Peter trying to make the Sanhedrin remember? 

31 God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. What happened to Jesus? What was Jesus purpose? 

32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.” What did the disciples witness? Who else was a witness? 

5:29彼得和众使徒回答说，顺从神，不顺从人，是应当的。5:30你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣，我们祖宗的神已经叫他复活。彼得想要让犹太公会的人记起什么？

5:31神且用右手将他高举，（或作他就是神高举在自己的右边）叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心，和赦罪的恩，赐给以色列人。什么事情发生在主耶稣的身上？耶稣来的目的是什么？

5:32我们为这事作见证。神赐给顺从之人的圣灵，也为这事作见证。使徒们为什么事做了见证？还有谁也做了见证？

33 When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. 34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. Who did Gamaiel order to be taken out? Why? 

35 Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. 36 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. What happened after Theudas as killed?

37 After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. What happened to Judas the Galilean’s followers after he was killed? 

38 Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.” Who might the counsel be fighting against? 

5:33公会的人听见就极其恼怒，想要杀他们。5:34但有一个法利赛人，名叫迦玛列，是众百姓所敬重的教法师，在公会中站起来，吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去。迦玛列吩咐把谁带到外面去？为什么？

5:35就对众人说，以色列人哪，论到这些人，你们应当小心怎样办理。5:36从前丢大起来，自夸为大。附从他的人约有四百。他被杀后，附从他的全都散了，归于无有。丢大死后发生了什么事？

5:37此后报名上册的时候，又有加利利的犹大起来，引诱些百姓跟从他，他也灭亡，附从他的人也都四散了。加利利的犹大死后他的追随者都怎么样了？

5:38现在我劝你们不要管这些人，任凭他们吧，他们所谋的，所行的，若是出于人，必要败坏。5:39若是出于神，你们就不能败坏他们。恐怕你们倒是攻击神了。公会可能是与谁作对？

40 His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. What were the apostle once again ordered? 

41 The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. 42 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah. What did the apostles once again resume? 

5:40公会的人听从了他，便叫使徒来，把他们打了，又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道，就把他们释放了。使徒们又再一次被吩咐了什么？

5:41他们离开公会，心里欢喜。因被算是配为这名受辱。5:42他们就每日在殿里，在家里，不住地教训人，传耶稣是基督。使徒们又再一次继续开始做什么事？
