##### Acts 1:1-26  使徒行传 1:1-26


###### Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven 耶稣升天 

1 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach What former writing is connected with this book? 

2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. What instructions had Jesus given? 

3 After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. What did Jesus speak to them about? 

4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, Where were the disciples? but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. What is the promise of the Father? 

5 For John baptized withwater, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.” What do you know about the Holy Spirit? 

1提阿非罗啊，我已经作了前书，论到耶稣开头一切所行所教训的，哪一本前书与这本书相关联？

2直到他借着圣灵吩咐所拣选的使徒，以后被接上升的日子为止。耶稣给了门徒什么吩咐？3他受害之后，用许多的凭据将自己活活地显给使徒看，四十天之久向他们显现，讲说　神国的事。耶稣向他们讲说什么？

4耶稣和他们聚集的时候，嘱咐他们说：「不要离开耶路撒冷，门徒当时在哪里？要等候父所应许的，就是你们听见我说过的。父所应许的是什么？

5约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。关于圣灵，你都知道什么？

6 Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” What do you think the disciples meant by this question?

7 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. What was Jesus answer? 

8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” What is the purpose of the power of the Holy Spirit? How far would the Gospel travel? 

9 After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. How would the ascension of Jesus help the disciples in times to come? 

10 They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. Who were these men? 

11 “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? Who are these men? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.” How will Jesus return? 
 
 6 他们聚集的时候，问耶稣说：「主啊，你复兴以色列国就在这时候吗？」你认为门徒问这个问题的意思是什么？ 

7 耶稣对他们说：「父凭着自己的权柄所定的时候、日期，不是你们可以知道的。耶稣如何回答的？

8 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力，并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地，和撒马利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。圣灵所赋予的能力的目的是什么？福音要传到多远？ 

9 说了这话，他们正看的时候，他就被取上升，有一朵云彩把他接去，便看不见他了。耶稣升天在门徒们未来的日子里能如何帮助他们？ 

10 当他往上去，他们定睛望天的时候，忽然有两个人身穿白衣，站在旁边，说：这些人是谁？

11 「加利利人哪，你们为什么站着望天呢？这些（加利利）人是谁？这离开你们被接升天的耶稣，你们见他怎样往天上去，他还要怎样来。」耶稣会如何再来？

###### Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas 马提亚被拣选代替犹大 

12 Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day’s walkfrom the city. What other recent event happened at the Mount of Olives? 

13 When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 14 They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. What groups of people gathered in the upper room? Why? 

12 有一座山，名叫橄榄山，离耶路撒冷不远，约有安息日可走的路程。当下，门徒从那里回耶路撒冷去，当时在橄榄山上都发生了什么事？

13 进了城，就上了所住的一间楼房；在那里有彼得、约翰、雅各、安得烈、腓力、多马、巴多罗买、马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、奋锐党的西门，和雅各的儿子犹大。14 这些人同着几个妇人和耶稣的母亲马利亚，并耶稣的弟兄，都同心合意地恒切祷告。楼房里都聚集着一群什么人？为什么？

15 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) 16 and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus. 17 He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.” What did Peter want the believers to know? 

15那时，有许多人聚会，约有一百二十名，彼得就在弟兄中间站起来，16说：「弟兄们！圣灵借大卫的口，在圣经上预言领人捉拿耶稣的犹大，这话是必须应验的。17他本来列在我们数中，并且在使徒的职任上得了一分。彼得想要让信徒们知道什么？ 

18 (With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. What do we learn about Judas death? 19 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) 

18这人用他作恶的工价买了一块田，以后身子仆倒，肚腹崩裂，肠子都流出来。关于犹大的死，我们都知道什么？19住在耶路撒冷的众人都知道这事，所以按着他们那里的话给那块田起名叫亚革大马，就是「血田」的意思。 

20 “For,” said Peter, “it is written in the Book of Psalms: “‘May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and, “‘May another take his place of leadership.’ What did Peter suggest? 

20 因为诗篇上写着，说： 愿他的住处变为荒场， 无人在内居住； 又说： 愿别人得他的职分。彼得要说明什么？

21 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us, 22 beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.” What qualifications must the replacement have? 

21所以，主耶稣在我们中间始终出入的时候，22就是从约翰施洗起，直到主离开我们被接上升的日子为止，必须从那常与我们作伴的人中立一位与我们同作耶稣复活的见证。这个替代者必须要符合什么条件？ 

23 So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 24 Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen 25 to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.”Who did he disciples turn to in choosing a replacement? 26 Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles. Who was chosen? Summarize the four steps taken to choose a replacement. 

23于是选举两个人，就是那叫做巴撒巴，又称呼犹士都的约瑟，和马提亚。24–25众人就祷告说：「主啊，你知道万人的心，求你从这两个人中，指明你所拣选的是谁，叫他得这使徒的位分。这位分犹大已经丢弃，往自己的地方去了。」在选择替代者时，门徒向谁求助？26于是众人为他们摇签，摇出马提亚来；他就和十一个使徒同列。谁被选中？请总结一下拣选替代者的四个步骤。
