##### Acts 8:1-40 使徒行传 8：1-40

It has probably been close to six years since Jesus ascended and the Apostles had not yet extended their activity beyond Jerusalem for Jesus had told them to begin there. "and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem". Luke 24:47

Chapters 2-7 dealt with proclaiming the Gospel in Jerusalem. Now the Lord was going to have His Gospel spread to Judea and Samaria. Chapters 8-12 transfers Saul, the ringleader of the persecution, into one of His apostles whose mission was to begin bringing Christianity to the ends of the earth, chapters 13-28.

In this chapter we will learn more about Philip, the evangelist chosen with Stephen. We will read about Philip's work in Samaria and then Philip's role in bringing the man from Ethiopia to faith in Jesus.

此时距耶稣升天大概已有近6年的时间了，使徒们还没有将他们的活动范围扩展到耶路撒冷以外，因为主耶稣告诉他们要从那里开始。“并且人要奉他的名传悔改赦罪的道、从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。”路加福音24：47。

第2到7章讲的是在耶路撒冷传讲福音。此时神要将祂的福音传到犹大和撒玛利亚。第8到12章讲的是保罗悔改，他从一个迫害基督徒的首领变为一位耶稣的使徒，他的使命就是要把福音传到地级（第13到28章）。

在这一章我们会读到腓利，他与司提反一起传福音。我们将会读到腓利在撒玛利亚的事工以及腓利在带领一位埃提阿伯人信主中所起到的作用。

1 And Saul approved of their killing him.  扫罗也喜悦他被害。

###### The Church Persecuted and Scattered 教会受逼迫分散

On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. 2 What happened to the church in Jerusalem and what was the result? Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. 

3 But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison. What was Saul's mission?

8:1      从这日起、耶路撒冷的教会、大遭逼迫．除了使徒以外、门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛利亚各处。8:2         有虔诚的人、把司提反埋葬了、为他捶胸大哭。耶稣撒冷的教会发生了什么事？后果是什么？

8:3           扫罗却残害教会、进各人的家、拉着男女下在监里。保罗的使命是什么？

###### Philip in Samaria 腓利在撒玛利亚

4 Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. Describe what the peopledid when they left Jerusalem. 

5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there. Why do you think Philip was no longer staying in Jerusalem? What do you remember about Samaria? Why would the people go to Samaria? Imagine a conversation from a Jewish stranger coming to Samaria. 6 When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid close attention to what he said. How did the Samaritans receive Philip?

7 For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. What was Philip able to perform? 8 So there was great joy in that city.

8:4      那些分散的人、往各处去传道。请叙述一下人们离开耶路撒冷后都在做什么？

8:5          腓利下撒玛利亚城去、宣讲基督。你认为腓利为什么没再留在耶路撒冷？关于撒玛利亚你都还记得什么？人们为什么会去撒玛利亚？请假想一个来到撒玛利亚的犹太人的对话。8:6  众人听见了、又看见腓利所行的神迹、就同心合意的听从他的话．撒玛利亚人如何对待腓利？

8:7         因为有许多人被污鬼附着、那些鬼大声呼叫、从他们身上出来．还有许多瘫痪的、瘸腿的、都得了医治。腓利做了什么事？8:8            在那城里、就大有欢喜。

###### Simon the Sorcerer 行邪术的西门

9 Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. What did Simon practice? He boasted that he was someone great, 

10 and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, “This man is rightly called the Great Power of God.” What did the people believe about Simon? 

11 They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery. 12 But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 13 Simon himself believed and was baptized. What happened to Simon? And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. Why do you think Simon was astonished?

8:9  有一个人、名叫西门、向来在那城里行邪术、妄自尊大、使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇．西门做了什么？

8:10 无论大小、都听从他、说、这人就是那称为　神的大能者。人们为什么相信西门？

8:11  他们听从他、因他久用邪术、使他们惊奇。8:12      及至他们信了腓利所传　神国的福音、和耶稣基督的名、连男带女就受了洗。8:13      西门自己也信了．既受了洗、就常与腓利在一处．西门发生了什么事？看见他所行的神迹和大异能、就甚惊奇。你认为西门为什么惊奇？

14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. 15 When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Why did Peter and John come? 

17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. What happened in vs. 17?


8:14    使徒在耶路撒冷、听见撒玛利亚人领受了　神的道、就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。8:15            两个人到了、就为他们祷告、要叫他们受圣灵．8:16     因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上．他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。彼得和约翰为什么来？

8:17  于是使徒按手在他们头上、他们就受了圣灵。17节中发生了什么事？

18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money 19 and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” What did Simon not understand?

20 Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! 21 You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. What did Peter realize? 22 Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. 23 For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”24 Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.” What did Simon want?

25 After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. How did Peter and John show their commitment to the Gospel?

8:18    西门看见使徒按手、便有圣灵赐下．就拿钱给使徒、8:19            说、把这权柄也给我、叫我手按着谁、谁就可以受圣灵。西门没有理解什么？

8:20    彼得说、你的银子、和你一同灭亡吧．因你想　神的恩赐、是可以用钱买的。8:21你在这道上、无分无关．因为在　神面前、你的心不正。彼得看出了什么？

8:22      你当懊悔你这罪恶、祈求主．或者你心里的意念可得赦免。8:23       我看出你正在苦胆之中、被罪恶捆绑。8:24    西门说、愿你们为我求主、叫你们所说的、没有一样临到我身上。西门想要什么？

8:25    使徒既证明主道、而且传讲、就回耶路撒冷去、一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。彼得和约翰如何显出他们对福音的委身？

###### Philip and the Ethiopian 腓利与埃提阿伯太监

26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”Where was Philip going?Where was Gaza? What type of road was this? 

27 So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means “queen of the Ethiopians”). Where is Ethiopia? What position did this man have?  This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, 

28 and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the prophet. What do we learn about this man? 

29 The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.” Why do you think the Spirit had to tell Philip to go near the chariot?

8:26           有主的一个使者对腓利说、起来、向南走、往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。腓利要去哪里？迦萨在哪里？这是什么样的路？

8:27           腓利就起身去了．不料、有一个埃提阿伯〔即古实见以赛亚十八章一节〕人、是个有大权的太监、在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库、他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了．埃提阿伯在哪里？这个人是做什么官的？

8:28           现在回来、在车上坐着、念先知以赛亚的书。从这里关于这个太监我们都知道什么？

8:29           圣灵对腓利说、你去贴近那车走。你认为为什么圣灵要腓利去到车那里？

30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked. Why would Philip ask the question?

31 “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. What else do we learn about the Ethiopian?

32 This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading:

   “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,
   and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
   so he did not open his mouth.
33 In his humiliation he was deprived of justice.
   Who can speak of his descendants?
   For his life was taken from the earth.” (Cite from Isaiah 53:7-8)

8:30    腓利就跑到太监那里、听见他念先知以赛亚的书、便问他说、你所念的、你明白么。腓利为什么要问这个问题？

8:31    他说、没有人指教我、怎能明白呢。于是请腓利上车、与他同坐。关于这个埃提阿伯人我们还知道什么？

8:32    他所念的那段经、说、『他像羊被牵到宰杀之地、又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声、他也是这样不开口。 8:33    他卑微的时候、人不按公义审判他．〔原文作他的审判被夺去〕谁能述说他的世代、因为他的生命从地上夺去。』（引自以赛亚书53：7-8）

34 The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” 35 Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. What did the eunuch not  understand? What did Philip tell the eunuch?

36 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?” [37 See note below] 38 And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. Why would the eunuch want to be baptized? 

39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. 40 Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea. What did Philip continue to do?

8:34    太监对腓利说、请问、先知说这话、是指着谁、是指着自己呢、是指着别人呢。8:35    腓利就开口从这经上起、对他传讲耶稣。这个太监不知道什么？腓利告诉了他什么？

8:36    二人正往前走、到了有水的地方．太监说、看哪、这里有水、我受洗有甚么妨碍呢。〔有古卷在此有 8:37    腓利说、你若是一心相信、就可以．他回答说我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子〕8:38    于是吩咐车站住、腓利和太监二人同下水里去、腓利就给他施洗。这个太监为什么想要受洗？

8:39    从水里上来、主的灵把腓利提了去、太监也不再见他了、就欢欢喜喜的走路。8:40    后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利、他走遍那地方、在各城宣传福音、直到该撒利亚。腓利继续做什么？

Acts 8:37 Some manuscripts include here [Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” The eunuch answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”]


使徒行传8：37有古卷在此有【腓利说、你若是一心相信、就可以．他回答说我信耶稣基督是　神的儿子】
