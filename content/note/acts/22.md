###### Acts 22:1-30 使徒行传22:1-30

Paul's speech before the riotous mob was made from one of the flights of stairs which ascended to the Antonia fortress. Paul talked in the Aramaic language which is somewhat similar to Hebrew. It was the international language of non-Greeks in the eastern Roman world. Jews learned Aramaic during the Babylonian Captivity. Paul wanted to get his hostile audience to understand how he, a former persecutor of Christians , came to be a Christian.

保罗在通向营楼的台阶上向底下的暴民们讲话。保罗说的是很类似希伯来文的亚兰文。这种语言是罗马帝国的东部非希腊语系地区的通用语。犹太人在被掳于巴比伦时期掌握了亚兰文。保罗在这时要让这些抵挡他的听众明白，他是怎样由一个迫害基督徒的人转变为基督徒的。

1 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.” 2 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said: 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Where was Paul's background?  I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. How did Paul describe himself? 

4 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, 5 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. How did Paul spend his early years?  I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished. What was Paul determined to do? Who did the Jews not believe in and why?

1 「诸位父兄请听，我现在对你们分诉。」2 众人听他说的是希伯来话，就更加安静了。3 保罗说：「我原是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，长在这城里，保罗是哪里人？在迦玛列门下，按着我们祖宗严紧的律法受教，热心事奉　神，像你们众人今日一样。保罗是怎样描述自己的？

4 我也曾逼迫奉这道的人，直到死地，无论男女都锁拿下监。5 这是大祭司和众长老都可以给我作见证的。保罗从前是怎样的？我又领了他们达与弟兄的书信，往大马士革去，要把在那里奉这道的人锁拿，带到耶路撒冷受刑。」保罗那时要计划做什么事？犹太人不愿意信谁？为什么？

6 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’What do we learn happened to Saul (Paul)?

8 “‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. What did Saul not know? “ ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ he replied. To whom did the voice belong? 

9 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me. 10 “‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked. “ ‘Get up,’ the Lord said, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’ 11 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me. Why was Paul led by the hand to Damascus? What would he learn there

12 “A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. 13 He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him. Who helped Saul receive his sight?

14 “Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. Who chose Saul? What would Saul hear? 

15 You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard. What would Saul's future hold? 16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’ How was Saul going to begin his change of heart?

6 「我将到大马士革，正走的时候，约在晌午，忽然从天上发大光，四面照着我。7 我就仆倒在地，听见有声音对我说：『扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？』我们可以知道在扫罗（保罗）身上发生了什么事？

8 我回答说：『主啊，你是谁？』扫罗不知道的是什么？他说：『我就是你所逼迫的拿撒勒人耶稣。』这声音是谁的？

9 与我同行的人看见了那光，却没有听明那位对我说话的声音。10 我说：『主啊，我当做什么？』主说：『起来，进大马士革去，在那里，要将所派你做的一切事告诉你。』11 我因那光的荣耀不能看见，同行的人就拉着我手进了大马士革。保罗为什么要被拉着手进大马士革？她在哪里要明白什么？

12 那里有一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，按着律法是虔诚人，为一切住在那里的犹太人所称赞。13 他来见我，站在旁边，对我说：『兄弟扫罗，你可以看见。』我当时往上一看，就看见了他。谁帮助保罗恢复了视力？

14 他又说：『我们祖宗的　神拣选了你，叫你明白他的旨意，又得见那义者，听他口中所出的声音。谁拣选了扫罗？扫罗将听到什么信息？

15因为你要将所看见的，所听见的，对着万人为他作见证。16 现在你为什么耽延呢？起来，求告他的名受洗，洗去你的罪。』」扫罗改变心意的起初做了什么？

17 “When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance 18 and saw the Lord speaking to me. ‘Quick!’ he said. ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’ What message did Paul receive? When did Paul receive this message? (Hint: Acts 9:26-30)

19 “‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’ Why did Saul know that the Jewish believers in Jerusalem would not receive him? 21 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”

17 「后来，我回到耶路撒冷，在殿里祷告的时候，魂游象外，18 看见主向我说：『你赶紧地离开耶路撒冷，不可迟延；因你为我作的见证，这里的人必不领受。』保罗领受了什么信息？保罗什么时候领受这些信息的？（提示：使徒行传9:26-30）

19 我就说：『主啊，他们知道我从前把信你的人收在监里，又在各会堂里鞭打他们。20 并且你的见证人司提反被害流血的时候，我也站在旁边欢喜；又看守害死他之人的衣裳。』保罗为什么知道在耶路撒冷的犹太信徒不愿意接纳他？21 主向我说：『你去吧！我要差你远远地往外邦人那里去。』」

Gamaliel - The most honored rabbi of the first century. He was traditionally listed as the head of the schools where men studied to be rabbis.

迦玛列 - 第一世纪时非常尊贵的拉比。传统上，所有培训拉比的学校都以他为领袖。

###### Paul the Roman Citizen 保罗的罗马人身份

22 The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!” Why did the crowd no longer want to listen to Paul?

23 As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, 24 the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. What did the commander not believe? 

25 As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn’t even been found guilty?” What did Paul tell the centurion? Why was this important?

26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. “What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.” 27 The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” What does the commander want to know? “Yes, I am,” he answered.

28 Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.” How did the commander become a citizen of Rome? “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied. 

29 Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. Why would they withdraw? The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.

22 众人听他说到这句话，就高声说：「这样的人，从世上除掉他吧！他是不当活着的。」众人为什么不再愿意听保罗讲话？

23 众人喧嚷，摔掉衣裳，把尘土向空中扬起来。24 千夫长就吩咐将保罗带进营楼去，叫人用鞭子拷问他，要知道他们向他这样喧嚷是为什么缘故。千夫长不信什么？

25 刚用皮条捆上，保罗对旁边站着的百夫长说：「人是罗马人，又没有定罪，你们就鞭打他，有这个例吗？」保罗对百夫长说了什么？为什么这点很重要？

26 百夫长听见这话，就去见千夫长，告诉他说：「你要做什么？这人是罗马人。」27 千夫长就来问保罗说：「你告诉我，你是罗马人吗？」千夫长想要知道什么？保罗说：「是。」

28 千夫长说：「我用许多银子才入了罗马的民籍。」这个千夫长是怎样成为罗马人的？保罗说：「我生来就是。」

29 于是那些要拷问保罗的人就离开他去了。他们为什么要离开？千夫长既知道他是罗马人，又因为捆绑了他，也害怕了。

###### Notes: 注释：

Flogged - Flogging was a techniques commonly employed by Romans to extract the truth or a confession from a person. The being flogged was made to bend over a pillar; his hands and feet were tied to rings in the floor, and his back bared for the lashes administered by two soldiers standing opposite one another with a scourge. The scourge consisted of a short handle with thongs affixed to it, each one of which had a piece of metal or bone fastened to its tip.

鞭子拷问 -罗马人通常用鞭子来拷问人以使他们澄清事实。被拷问的人要被绑在柱子上，手和脚拷在地上的环里，露出脊背，由两名士兵相对站立鞭打。鞭子由带有钉刺的短棒组成每个棒上还附有金属或骨头在顶上。

Roman citizen - Rome watched out for the rights of its citizens. Its laws insured a legal, fair trial for every citizen. If there had been a trial, Paul's citizenship would have been brought out in the open and the commander could lose his post or face death.

罗马人 - 罗马保护它子民的权利。它的法律确保每个罗马人都有得到合法、公平的审判的权利。如果之前有审判的话，保罗的罗马人身份将公布于众，千夫长因此可能失去职位或面临死刑。

###### Paul Before the Sanhedrin 保罗在公会前申诉

30 The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. What did the commander want to find out? So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Who did the commander have brought together?  Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them. Why?

30 第二天，千夫长为要知道犹太人控告保罗的实情，千夫长要了解什么情况？便解开他，吩咐祭司长和全公会的人都聚集，千夫长聚集了哪些人？将保罗带下来，叫他站在他们面前。为什么？
