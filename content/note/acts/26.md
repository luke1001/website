##### Acts 26:1-32 使徒行传 26:1-32

Festus had turned the proceedings over to Agrippa. So it was the king who gave Paul permission to speak in his defense. Religiously Agrippa was a Jew. It should be observed that this was no trial. No accusers or witnesses were present. No verdict would be handed down. Paul consented to speak, not merely to prove his innocence, but to preach the gospel to those present.


非斯都将这场诉讼转交给了亚基帕王。因此是亚基帕王准许保罗为自己辩护。按着宗教信仰亚基帕王是一个犹太人。我们也会发现这并不是一此审判。现场没有控方或见证人出席。将不会有最终的判决。保罗同意在此发言并不仅是为了证明自己的清白，而且还为了传福音给在场的人听。

1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense: 2 “King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews, What did Paul state as the reason he was meeting Agrippa? 

3 and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently. What does Paul know about King Agrippa?

4 “The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem. What does Paul disclose about himself? 

5 They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee. How had Paul lived his life? 

6 And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I am on trial today. What had God promised? 

7 This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope that these Jews are accusing me. What does Paul explain as the reason the Jews are accusing him? 

8 Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? What kind of God was Paul speaking about?

9 “I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. What was Paul's mission when he was a Pharisee?    

10 And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. Who gave Paul the authority to put people into prison?  

11 Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. What Paul mean to blaspheme? I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities. How did Paul show he was determined to persecute those who believed in Jesus? What does Paul want King Agrippa to understand?


1亚基帕对保罗说：「准你为自己辩明。」于是保罗伸手分诉，说：「2亚基帕王啊，犹太人所告我的一切事，今日得在你面前分诉，实为万幸；保罗在此澄明是什么原因使他站在亚基帕王面前分述？

3更可幸的，是你熟悉犹太人的规矩和他们的辩论；所以求你耐心听我。保罗对亚基帕王有怎样的认识？

4我从起初在本国的民中，并在耶路撒冷，自幼为人如何，犹太人都知道。保罗是怎样描述自己的？

5他们若肯作见证就晓得，我从起初是按着我们教中最严紧的教门作了法利赛人。保罗是怎样生活的？

6现在我站在这里受审，是因为指望　神向我们祖宗所应许的；神有怎样的应许？

7这应许，我们十二个支派，昼夜切切地事奉　神，都指望得着。王啊，我被犹太人控告，就是因这指望。关于犹太人控告保罗的原因，保罗是如何说明的？

8神叫死人复活，你们为什么看作不可信的呢？保罗所讲的是怎样的一位神？

9从前我自己以为应当多方攻击拿撒勒人耶稣的名，保罗做法利赛人时，他的目标是什么？

10我在耶路撒冷也曾这样行了。既从祭司长得了权柄，我就把许多圣徒囚在监里。他们被杀，我也出名定案。谁给保罗权柄可以让他把人囚在监狱里？

11在各会堂，我屡次用刑强逼他们说亵渎的话，保罗说的亵渎是什么意思？又分外恼恨他们，甚至追逼他们，直到外邦的城邑。」保罗是怎样显明自己曾经定意要迫害相信耶稣的人的？保罗想要亚基帕王明白什么？

12 “On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 13 About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. What do we learn about this light? 

14 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’15 “Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ What did Saul not know? “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. 

16 ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me. Who appeared to Paul? What was the message? 

17 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. How was Paul rescued?  I am sending you to them 

18 to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ Who was Paul being sent to and for what reasons?

12「那时，我领了祭司长的权柄和命令，往大马士革去。13王啊，我在路上，晌午的时候，看见从天发光，比日头还亮，四面照着我并与我同行的人。我们从这光中学到了什么？

14我们都仆倒在地，我就听见有声音用希伯来话向我说：『扫罗！扫罗！为什么逼迫我？你用脚踢刺是难的！』15我说：『主啊，你是谁？』保罗所不知道的是？主说：『我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。

16你起来站着，我特意向你显现，要派你作执事，作见证，将你所看见的事和我将要指示你的事证明出来。谁向保罗显现了？启示了什么？

17我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。保罗是如何得救的？

18我差你到他们那里去，要叫他们的眼睛得开，从黑暗中归向光明，从撒但权下归向　神；又因信我，得蒙赦罪，和一切成圣的人同得基业。』」保罗被差向哪些人，为什么？

19 “So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven. How did Paul respond to Jesus message? 

20 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. What was Paul's message? 

21 That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. Why did the Jews seize Paul? 

22 But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen— Who else had been preaching this same message? 

23 that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.” What is the message of light?

19 「亚基帕王啊，我故此没有违背那从天上来的异象；保罗是如何回应耶稣的启示的？

20 先在大马士革，后在耶路撒冷和犹太全地，以及外邦，劝勉他们应当悔改归向　神，行事与悔改的心相称。保罗所传的信息是什么？

21 因此，犹太人在殿里拿住我，想要杀我。犹太人为什么要拿住保罗？

22 然而我蒙　神的帮助，直到今日还站得住，对着尊贵、卑贱、老幼作见证；所讲的并不外乎众先知和摩西所说将来必成的事，还有哪些人也传讲了同样的信息？

23 就是基督必须受害，并且因从死里复活，要首先把光明的道传给百姓和外邦人。」光明的道是指什么？

24 At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”How did Festus describe Paul?  

25 “I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying is true and reasonable. 26 The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. Why could the king say that Paul was true and reasonable? I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. What was not done in a corner? 

27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.” What does Paul mean to believe the prophets? Why would King Agrippa believe the prophets?

28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?” Why did King Agrippa not answer the question and instead ask one?

29 Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”What was Paul?


24保罗这样分诉，非斯都大声说：「保罗，你癫狂了吧。你的学问太大，反叫你癫狂了！」非斯都是如何描述保罗的？

25保罗说：「非斯都大人，我不是癫狂，我说的乃是真实明白话。26王也晓得这些事，所以我向王放胆直言，为什么王能晓得保罗所说的是真实明白的。我深信这些事没有一件向王隐藏的，因都不是在背地里做的。什么事不是在背地里做的？

27亚基帕王啊，你信先知吗？我知道你是信的。」保罗说信先知是什么意思？亚基帕王为什么会信先知？

28亚基帕对保罗说：「你想少微一劝，便叫我作基督徒啊！」亚基帕王为什么不回答保罗的问题却反而提出问题？

29保罗说：「无论是少劝是多劝，我向　神所求的，不但你一个人，就是今天一切听我的，都要像我一样，只是不要像我有这些锁链。」保罗是怎样的？

30 The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them. By rising, what did the king end? 31 After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.” What was the conclusion?
   32 Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.” Was Agrippa able to help Festus with the charge to deliver to Caesar?


30于是，王和巡抚并百妮基与同坐的人都起来，王站起来后，显明他最终是什么态度？31退到里面，彼此谈论说：「这人并没有犯什么该死该绑的罪。」他们的结论是什么？

32亚基帕又对非斯都说：「这人若没有上告于凯撒，就可以释放了。」亚基帕王是否能帮助非斯都处理上告于凯撒的案子？

Kick against the goads - Goads were prods to make animas move. It was useless to fight and the animal may only succeed in hurting itself.

用脚踢刺 - 刺是用来戳动物，让它们活动的。动物若和刺争斗不仅没有意义而且只会伤害自己。
