##### Acts 9:1-43 使徒行传 9:1-43

This chapter tells about the conversion of Saul from a persecutor of Christians into one Christ's apostles. Saul's newly created Christ-centered faith replaced his former law-centered thinking. Saul comes to realize that Jesus was in truth the Messiah, the Son of God, and that in Him God really did make atonement for the sins of mankind.

这一章讲的是保罗的悔改，他从一个迫害基督徒的人转变为基督的使徒。在保罗里面，新生的以基督为首的信心代替了他原本以律法为中心的想法。保罗认识到耶稣就是真弥赛亚，神的儿子，通过祂神为人类的罪做了赎罪祭。

###### Saul’s Conversion  扫罗的转变

1 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. What had Saul wanted to do to the disciples? He went to the high priest 

2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. What was Saul's new plan? Who were the people who belonged to the Way? 

3 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” Who was speaking to Saul?

5 “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked.
   “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied. 6 “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” Who was Saul persecuting? What was Jesus command?

7 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. Who were the men traveling with Saul? 

8 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. What happened to Saul? 9 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything. Read Acts 22:3-21 to learn more details about Saul's conversion.


1 扫罗仍然向主的门徒口吐威吓凶杀的话，去见大祭司。扫罗要对门徒们做什么？

2 求文书给大马士革的各会堂，若是找着信奉这道的人，无论男女，都准他捆绑带到耶路撒冷。扫罗的计划是什么？信奉这道的是哪些人？

3 扫罗行路，将到大马士革，忽然从天上发光，四面照着他；4 他就仆倒在地，听见有声音对他说：「扫罗！扫罗！你为什么逼迫我？」是谁在对扫罗说话？

5 他说：「主啊！你是谁？」主说：「我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。6 起来！进城去，你所当做的事，必有人告诉你。」扫罗在逼迫谁？耶稣的命令是什么？

7 同行的人站在那里，说不出话来，听见声音，却看不见人。和扫罗同行的人是谁？

8 扫罗从地上起来，睁开眼睛，竟不能看见什么。有人拉他的手，领他进了大马士革；在扫罗身上发生了什么事？9 三日不能看见，也不吃也不喝。请读使徒行传22:3-21节进一步了解扫罗的转变。

10 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!” Who called Ananias?
   “Yes, Lord,” he answered. What was Ananias reply? 

11 The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.” Why was Ananias to go to Saul?

13 “Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. 14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”What did Ananias know about Saul?

15 But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. What was God's plan for Saul? 16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.” What are some ways Saul might suffer?

17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”How did Ananias obey the Lord? With whom was Saul to be filled? 

18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, What did Saul do when he got up?19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength.

10 当下，在大马士革有一个门徒，名叫亚拿尼亚。主在异象中对他说：「亚拿尼亚。」亚拿尼亚是谁？他说：「主，我在这里。」亚拿尼亚如何回应的？

11 主对他说：「起来！往直街去，在犹大的家里，访问一个大数人，名叫扫罗。他正祷告，12 又看见了一个人，名叫亚拿尼亚，进来按手在他身上，叫他能看见。」为什么亚拿尼亚要去扫罗那里？

13 亚拿尼亚回答说：「主啊，我听见许多人说，这人怎样在耶路撒冷多多苦害你的圣徒，14 并且他在这里有从祭司长得来的权柄捆绑一切求告你名的人。」15 主对亚拿尼亚说：「你只管去！他是我所拣选的器皿，要在外邦人和君王，并以色列人面前宣扬我的名。神对扫罗的计划是什么？

15 主对亚拿尼亚说：「你只管去！他是我所拣选的器皿，要在外邦人和君王，并以色列人面前宣扬我的名。16 我也要指示他，为我的名必须受许多的苦难。」扫罗将会受到什么样的苦难？

17 亚拿尼亚就去了，进入那家，把手按在扫罗身上，说：「兄弟扫罗，在你来的路上向你显现的主，就是耶稣，打发我来，叫你能看见，又被圣灵充满。」亚拿尼亚怎样遵行神的话的？扫罗被谁充满？

18 扫罗的眼睛上，好像有鳞立刻掉下来，他就能看见。于是起来受了洗；扫罗起来后做了什么？19 吃过饭就健壮了。

###### Notes: 注释:

Saul - Saul was born of Jewish parents. His father was a citizen of Taurus, a rich city and the residence of the Roman governor of the province and famed for its schools. Saul's father was a free born Roman and therefore a Roman citizen, as was Saul. Saul's father was also a Pharisee and brought Saul up as a son of the Law. As a boy, Saul learned the trade of making tents out of goat's hair. He lived in Taurus, north of Damascus, during Jesus ministry.

扫罗–扫罗出生在一个犹太家庭。他的父亲居住在大数城。大数是一个富裕的城市，居民包括罗马的官长并且以当地的学校而闻名。扫罗的父亲生来就是自由的罗马公民，扫罗也是如此。扫罗的父亲还是一个法利赛人并且按着律法教养扫罗。从孩子时起，扫罗就学习用山羊毛织帐篷的手艺。在耶稣在地上开展事工是，扫罗居住在大数，大马士革的北面。

High priest - The high priest was probably Caiaphas. The Roman government recognized the high priest's jurisdiction over Jews living outside of Palestine as well as over those within the country. In additional to having official credentials, Saul had a police guard whose function was to arrest Christians and bring them to Jerusalem.

大祭司– 这里的大祭司可能是指该亚法。罗马政府认可大祭司对居住在巴勒斯坦以外及全境的犹太人的司法权。除了正式的文书以外扫罗还得到了护卫兵来帮助他捉拿基督徒并带至耶路撒冷。

Damascus - Damascus is the capital of Syria and claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Damascus was on the trade route between Asia and Egypt. According to the New Testament, the Apostle Paul was converted on the Road to Damascus. In the New testament era there was a large Jewish community living in Damascus, as well as a Christian community. The distance to Damascus from Jerusalem was four to five days travel.

大马士革– 大马士革是叙利亚的首都并被称为世界上最古老的不断有人居住的城市。大马士革位于亚洲和埃及的贸易路线之中。在新约时代，那里有很大的犹太群体和基督徒社群定居。当时从大马士革到耶路撒冷的行程需要四到五天。

###### Saul in Damascus and Jerusalem 扫罗在大马士革和耶路撒冷

Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. How do you think Saul spent the time with the believers in Damascus? 20 At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. What was Saul's message? 21 All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” 22 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah. Why would the Jews be baffled?

23 After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him, 24 but Saul learned of their plan. What was the conspiracy? Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. 25 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall. How did Saul escape?

26 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. Why were the disciples refusing to let Saul join them? 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. Where have we heard of Barnabas? He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. 28 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. How were the disciples treating Saul now?29 He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him. Now who is trying to kill Saul?  30 When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. Where is Saul headed?

31 Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers. What caused the church to increase in numbers?


扫罗和大马士革的门徒同住了些日子，你对扫罗和门徒在大马士革同住怎么看？20 就在各会堂里宣传耶稣，说他是　神的儿子。扫罗传的是什么信息？21 凡听见的人都惊奇，说：「在耶路撒冷残害求告这名的，不是这人吗？并且他到这里来，特要捆绑他们，带到祭司长那里。」22 但扫罗越发有能力，驳倒住大马士革的犹太人，证明耶稣是基督。为什么犹太人会被驳倒？

23 过了好些日子，犹太人商议要杀扫罗，24 但他们的计谋被扫罗知道了。什么计谋？他们又昼夜在城门守候，要杀他。25 他的门徒就在夜间用筐子把他从城墙上缒下去。扫罗怎么逃脱的？

26 扫罗到了耶路撒冷，想与门徒结交，他们却都怕他，不信他是门徒。为什么门徒拒绝与扫罗结交？27 惟有巴拿巴接待他，领去见使徒，我们在哪里听到过巴拿巴？把他在路上怎么看见主，主怎么向他说话，他在大马士革怎么奉耶稣的名放胆传道，都述说出来。28 于是扫罗在耶路撒冷和门徒出入来往，这时门徒是如何对待扫罗的？29 奉主的名放胆传道，并与说希腊话的犹太人讲论辩驳；他们却想法子要杀他。这时谁要杀害扫罗？30 弟兄们知道了就送他下凯撒利亚，打发他往大数去。扫罗要去哪里？

31 那时，犹太、加利利、撒马利亚各处的教会都得平安，被建立；凡事敬畏主，蒙圣灵的安慰，人数就增多了。是什么原因使教会的人数增多？


###### Aeneas and Dorcas 以尼雅和多加

32 As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who lived in Lydda. Why was Peter traveling the country? 33 There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years. 34 “Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up your mat.”In whose name did Peter heal the man? Immediately Aeneas got up. 

35 All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. 36 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor. What do we learn about Tabitha? 

37 About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. 38 Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!” Why would the disciples ask for Peter? 39 Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them. 40 Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” Describe what Peter when he was with Tabitha. She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. 41 He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive. Why did Peter present Tabitha/Dorcas? 

42 This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. 43 Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.


32 彼得周流四方的时候，也到了居住吕大的圣徒那里；为什么彼得要周游四方？33 遇见一个人，名叫以尼雅，得了瘫痪，在褥子上躺卧八年。34 彼得对他说：「以尼雅，耶稣基督医好你了，起来！收拾你的褥子。」彼得奉谁的名医治这个人的？他就立刻起来了。

35 凡住吕大和沙的人都看见了他，就归服主。36 在约帕有一个女徒，名叫大比大，翻希腊话就是多加；她广行善事，多施周济。我们对大比大有哪些了解？

37 当时，她患病而死，有人把她洗了，停在楼上。38 吕大原与约帕相近；门徒听见彼得在那里，就打发两个人去见他，央求他说：「快到我们那里去，不要耽延。」为什么门徒去见彼得？39 彼得就起身和他们同去；到了，便有人领他上楼。众寡妇都站在彼得旁边哭，拿多加与她们同在时所做的里衣外衣给他看。40 彼得叫她们都出去，就跪下祷告，转身对着死人说：「大比大，起来！」描述彼得和大比大在一起时做了什么？她就睁开眼睛，见了彼得，便坐起来。41 彼得伸手扶她起来，叫众圣徒和寡妇进去，把多加活活地交给他们。为什么彼得要把大比大/多加交给众人？

42 这事传遍了约帕，就有许多人信了主。43 此后，彼得在约帕一个硝皮匠西门的家里住了多日。


###### Notes:注释：

Lydda - A days walk from Joppa.

吕大– 距离约帕约一天的路程。

Tanner - Occupations were frequently used with personal names to identify individuals further. In this case it was especially significant. A tanner was involved in treating the skins of dead animals, thus contacting the unclean according to Jewish law; so he was despised by many. Peter's decision to stay with him shows already a willingness to reject Jewish prejudice and prepares the way for Peter's coming vision and mission to the Gentiles.

硝皮匠– 通常把职业和人名连在一起方便识别。这里还有特别的意义。硝皮匠的工作包括处理动物皮毛，按犹太人的律法是不洁净的。因此会被许多人轻视。彼得决定与这个硝皮匠居住在一起，表明他愿意抛弃犹太人的成见并且为彼得将要得到的异象和面向外邦人的事工做预备。
