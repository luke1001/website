##### Acts 15:1-41 使徒行传 15:1-41

The inclusion of more and more Gentiles into the church which initially consisted of Jews was creating a problem which had to be faced and solved. In Acts 15:1-35 Luke states the problem and describes how the church's leaders solved it. The problem was, what is the requirement for Gentiles to have salvation and membership in the Christian church?

教会原本大部分是犹太人，然而随着外邦人越来越多的进入，产生了一个新问题亟需解决。在使徒行传15章1-35节，路加陈述了这个问题并且叙述了教会的领袖是如何解决这些问题的。这个问题就是，外邦人需要什么条件才可以得救并加入教会呢？

The Council at Jerusalem  耶路撒冷的会议

1 Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”What requirement was being told to believers?Where did the people come from? 

2 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. How did Paul and Barnabas handle the situation? 

3 The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. What news did Paul and Barnabas tell others? This news made all the believers very glad. 4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them. What type of greeting did Paul and Barnabas receive when they made it to Jerusalem?

5 Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.” What requirements did some who were formerly Pharisees say had to be kept?

1 有几个人从犹太下来，教训弟兄们说：「你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼，不能得救。」他们教导信徒必须满足什么条件？他们是从哪里来的？

2 保罗、巴拿巴与他们大大地纷争辩论；众门徒就定规，叫保罗、巴拿巴和本会中几个人，为所辩论的，上耶路撒冷去见使徒和长老。保罗和巴拿巴是怎么处理这件事的？

3 于是教会送他们起行。他们经过腓尼基、撒马利亚，随处传说外邦人归主的事，保罗和巴拿巴传说怎样的信息？叫众弟兄都甚欢喜。4 到了耶路撒冷，教会和使徒并长老都接待他们，他们就述说　神同他们所行的一切事。保罗和巴拿巴到了耶路撒冷以后受到了怎么样的接待？

5 惟有几个信徒是法利赛教门的人，起来说：「必须给外邦人行割礼，吩咐他们遵守摩西的律法。」曾经是法利赛人的信徒说了哪些需要遵守的条件？

6 The apostles and elders met to consider this question. Why did they meet to discuss the question? 

7 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. What did Peter tell the group? 

8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. How did God show He accepted the Gentiles? 9 He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. How is everyone purified? 

10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? What is the yoke? How come they or their ancestors could not bear it? 

11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” How are people saved?


6 使徒和长老聚会商议这事；他们为什么要聚会商议？

7 辩论已经多了，彼得就起来，说：「诸位弟兄，你们知道　神早已在你们中间拣选了我，叫外邦人从我口中得听福音之道，而且相信。彼得站起来说了什么？

8 知道人心的　神也为他们作了见证，赐圣灵给他们，正如给我们一样；9 又借着信洁净了他们的心，并不分他们我们。人们是怎么被洁净的？

10 现在为什么试探　神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭放在门徒的颈项上呢？什么是轭？为什么说他们和他们的祖宗都不能背负？

11 我们得救乃是因主耶稣的恩，和他们一样，这是我们所信的。」人们是如何得救的？

12 The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. What else were Paul and Barnabas able to do among the Gentiles?         

13 When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me. 14 Simon(or Peter) has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles. What incident is James talking about? (Hint: Acts 10:-9-32) 15 The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:

12 众人都默默无声，听巴拿巴和保罗述说　神借他们在外邦人中所行的神迹奇事。保罗和巴拿巴还在外邦人中做了哪些事？

13 他们住了声，雅各就说：「诸位弟兄，请听我的话。14 方才西门（或称彼得）述说　神当初怎样眷顾外邦人，从他们中间选取百姓归于自己的名下；雅各所举的是哪件事？（提示：使徒行传10:9-32）15 众先知的话也与这意思相合。

16 “‘After this I will return
   and rebuild David’s fallen tent.
Its ruins I will rebuild,
   and I will restore it,
17 that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
   even all the Gentiles who bear my name,
says the Lord, who does these things’(Amos 9:11,12)  
   18 things known from long ago. What does verse 17 tell us?
   19 “It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. 20 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. To whom is the letter to being written? What is the first thing the Gentiles should abstain from? What is the second? What is the third? Who does James want the Gentiles to be considerate towards? 

21 For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” What is still read in the synagogues?

16 正如经上所写的：
此后，我要回来，
重新修造大卫倒塌的帐幕，
把那破坏的重新修造建立起来，
17       叫余剩的人，
就是凡称为我名下的外邦人，
都寻求主。（阿摩司书 9:11,12）
18 这话是从创世以来显明这事的主说的。 19 「所以据我的意见，不可难为那归服　神的外邦人；20 只要写信，吩咐他们禁戒偶像的污秽和奸淫，并勒死的牲畜和血。这封信是写给谁的？外邦人首先要禁戒什么？第二呢？第三是什么？雅各想要外邦基督徒注重什么事？

21 因为从古以来，摩西的书在各城有人传讲，每逢安息日，在会堂里诵读。」会堂里诵读什么？


###### The Council’s Letter to Gentile Believers 会议的复函

22 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Who made the decision to send additional men? They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers. 

23 With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. 24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. Why were additional men chosen to go with Paul and Barnabas? 

28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.

22 那时，使徒和长老并全教会定意从他们中间拣选人，差他们和保罗、巴拿巴同往安提阿去；是谁决定额外拣选人与他们同去？所拣选的就是称呼巴撒巴的犹大和西拉。这两个人在弟兄中是作首领的。

23 于是写信交付他们，内中说：「使徒和作长老的弟兄们问安提阿、叙利亚、基利家外邦众弟兄的安。24 我们听说，有几个人从我们这里出去，用言语搅扰你们，惑乱你们的心。其实我们并没有吩咐他们。25 所以，我们同心定意，拣选几个人，差他们同我们所亲爱的巴拿巴和保罗往你们那里去。26 这二人是为我主耶稣基督的名不顾性命的。27 我们就差了犹大和西拉，他们也要亲口诉说这些事。为什么额外拣选人与保罗和巴拿巴同行？

28 因为圣灵和我们定意不将别的重担放在你们身上，惟有几件事是不可少的，29 就是禁戒祭偶像的物和血，并勒死的牲畜和奸淫。这几件你们若能自己禁戒不犯就好了。愿你们平安！」

30 So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. 31 The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. How did the people receive the message? 

32 Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers. What do we learn about Judas and Silas? 

33 After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. How were they sent off? [34 Some manuscripts include here: But Silas decided to remain there.] 35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. What did Paul and Barnabas continue?

30 他们既奉了差遣，就下安提阿去，聚集众人，交付书信。31 众人念了，因为信上安慰的话就欢喜了。众人如何接受这个信息的？

32 犹大和西拉也是先知，就用许多话劝勉弟兄，坚固他们。我们对犹大和西拉有哪些了解？

33 住了些日子，弟兄们打发他们平平安安地回到差遣他们的人那里去。【有古卷加：34 惟有西拉定意仍住在那里。】35 但保罗和巴拿巴仍住在安提阿，和许多别人一同教训人，传主的道。保罗和巴拿巴继续做什么工作？

###### Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas 保罗和巴拿巴分手

36 Sometime later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.” Where did Paul want to go? 

37 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, What do you remember about John Mark? 

38 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. What were Paul's objections?  (Acts 13:13) 

39 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, 40 but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. How many teams are going out now? 

41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. This is the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey. Barnabas and John Mark go the island of Cyprus. We do not hear of Barnabas any more.

36 过了些日子，保罗对巴拿巴说：「我们可以回到从前宣传主道的各城，看望弟兄们景况如何。」保罗想到哪里去？

37 巴拿巴有意要带称呼马可的约翰同去；你的约翰马可的事还有什么印象？

38 但保罗因为马可从前在旁非利亚离开他们，不和他们同去做工，就以为不可带他去。保罗反对的理由是什么？（使徒行传13:13）

39 于是二人起了争论，甚至彼此分开。巴拿巴带着马可，坐船往塞浦路斯去；40 保罗拣选了西拉，也出去，蒙弟兄们把他交于主的恩中。现在出现了几个团队？

41 他就走遍叙利亚、基利家，坚固众教会。这是保罗第二次传福音之旅的开始。巴拿巴和约翰马可去往塞浦路斯岛上。我们从此就再没有关于巴拿巴的消息了。
