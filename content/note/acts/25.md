##### Acts 25:1-27 使徒行传 25：1-27

Festus first appears as a governor who was intent on carrying out his duties as governor of Judea. Only three days after his arrival in the Roman capital, Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem. It was important to become acquainted with the political and religious situation there. It was the headquarters for the Sanhedrin, the body which regulated the life of the Jews all over the province, as much as Rome would allow.

非斯都首先作为巡抚出现在这里，他要行使做犹太地巡抚的职责。在他抵达罗马行省的首府凯撒利亚之后仅三天就上去耶路撒冷了。熟悉了解那里的政治、宗教情形是非常重要的。耶路撒冷是撒都该人的总部，撒都该人是在罗马政府的许可下管理犹太人在行省生活的团体。

###### Paul’s Trial Before Festus 保罗在非斯都面前受审

1 Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,  2 where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul. Why had Festus gone to Jerusalem? What did the Jewish leaders eventually bring? 

3 They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way. What did the Jewish leaders want from Festus? 

4 Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. 5 Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, they can press charges against him there.” How did Festus reply?

6 After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. How long did Festus spend in Jerusalem? The next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him. What did Festus order when he returned to Caesarea? 

7 When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them. What do we once again learn about the charges brought against Paul?

8 Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.” In what three areas did Paul make his defense? Which defense was new?

9 Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?” Why was Festus willing to send Paul to Jerusalem?

10 Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to be tried. Why should Paul be tried in Caesar's court? What was Paul reminding Festus? I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. What had Paul concluded? 

11 If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. What was Paul trying to make Festus realize? But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. What else did Paul want Festus to understand? I appeal to Caesar!” To whom was Paul appealing and why?

12 After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!” According to Roman law, what did Festus have to grant?


1 非斯都到了任，过了三天，就从凯撒利亚上耶路撒冷去。2 祭司长和犹太人的首领向他控告保罗，非斯都为什么要上耶路撒冷去？犹太人的首领又有什么计划？

3 又央告他，求他的情，将保罗提到耶路撒冷来，他们要在路上埋伏杀害他。犹太人的首领对非斯都有什么请求？

4 非斯都却回答说：「保罗押在凯撒利亚，我自己快要往那里去」；5 又说：「你们中间有权势的人与我一同下去，那人若有什么不是，就可以告他。」 非斯都是怎么回答的？

6 非斯都在他们那里住了不过十天八天，就下凯撒利亚去；非斯都在耶路撒冷住了多久？第二天坐堂，吩咐将保罗提上来。当非斯都从该撒利亚回来时下了什么命令？

7 保罗来了，那些从耶路撒冷下来的犹太人周围站着，将许多重大的事控告他，都是不能证实的。我们再次对这些指着保罗的控告有了怎样的认识？

8 保罗分诉说：「无论犹太人的律法，或是圣殿，或是凯撒，我都没有干犯。」保罗在哪三方面为自己辩护？那一项是新提出来的？

9 但非斯都要讨犹太人的喜欢，就问保罗说：「你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里听我审断这事吗？」非斯都为什么想要把保罗送去耶路撒冷？

10 保罗说：「我站在凯撒的堂前，这就是我应当受审的地方。为什么保罗当在凯撒的堂前受审？保罗提醒非斯都什么事？我向犹太人并没有行过什么不义的事，这也是你明明知道的。保罗做了怎样的总结？

11 我若行了不义的事，犯了什么该死的罪，就是死，我也不辞。保罗要让非斯都明白什么？他们所告我的事若都不实，就没有人可以把我交给他们。还有那些事是保罗要让非斯都明白的？我要上告于凯撒。」保罗要向谁控告？为什么？

12 非斯都和议会商量了，就说：「你既上告于凯撒，可以往凯撒那里去。」根据罗马律法，非斯都需要授予什么许可？

###### Notes: 注释：

Festus - Very little is known about Festus prior to his becoming the procurator of Judea. He was of a senatorial rank and was procurator from 60-62 A.D. He came to power at a difficult time. Although Festus was inclined to act righteously, he was unable to undo the mischief done by his predecessor, Felix. He was inclined to give in to the Jewish authorities and in the case of Paul, for  him to appeal to Caesar for a better quality of justice.

During his term of office Festus learned the outcome of a case submitted to Nero by Felix. Nero ruled against the Jews in their demand for greater participation in the government of Caesarea. This decision contribute the great rebellion of 66. A.D. Festus died in office after having served only two years.

非斯都 - 我们对非斯都成为犹太长官之前的事知之甚少。他是参议院中的一员，在公元60-62年做总督。在他掌权的时期，时局动荡。尽管非斯都倾向于秉性公义，但仍无法改变他的前任腓力斯所留下的祸根。在保罗的事上，他倾向于听从犹太人的首领，但允许保罗上告于凯撒以获得更公正的审判。

在非斯都的任期内，他承受了由腓力斯提交给尼禄的一个事件的结果。尼禄反对犹太人提出在该撒利亚有更大的自治权的要求。公元66年，这个决定促成了一次大规模的起义。非斯都在任两年后去世。

###### Festus Consults King Agrippa 非斯都与亚基帕王商议

13 A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. Why did King Agrippa and Bernice come to Caesarea? 

14 Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner. 15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned. Why did Festus discuss the case with King Agrippa?

16 “I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges. How did Festus try to make himself out as a man of Roman justice? 

17 When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in. 18 When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. What crimes was Festus expecting? 

19 Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. What charges were made? What had Paul discussed with Festus? 

20 I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; With what was Festus not familiar? What had Festus already done? so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges. What had Festus forgotten? 

21 But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.” What does Festus not tell King Agrippa about why he wanted to send Paul to Jerusalem?

22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.”He replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.” Who will Paul once again be able to give testimony about his beliefs?



13 过了些日子，亚基帕王和百妮基氏来到凯撒利亚，问非斯都安。亚基帕王和百妮基氏为什么来到凯撒利亚？

14 在那里住了多日，非斯都将保罗的事告诉王，说：「这里有一个人，是腓力斯留在监里的。15 我在耶路撒冷的时候，祭司长和犹太的长老将他的事禀报了我，求我定他的罪。非斯都为什么要和亚基帕王讨论这件事？

16 我对他们说，无论什么人，被告还没有和原告对质，未得机会分诉所告他的事，就先定他的罪，这不是罗马人的条例。非斯都是如何让自己显得像一个秉承罗马公义的人的？

17 及至他们都来到这里，我就不耽延，第二天便坐堂，吩咐把那人提上来。18 告他的人站着告他；所告的，并没有我所逆料的那等恶事。非斯都原本以为会有什么样的罪行？

19 不过是有几样辩论，为他们自己敬鬼神的事，又为一个人名叫耶稣，是已经死了，保罗却说他是活着的。非斯都是怎样判断的？保罗曾经和非斯都谈论过什么？

20 这些事当怎样究问，我心里作难，非斯都对什么事不熟悉？他已经做了什么决定？所以问他说：『你愿意上耶路撒冷去，在那里为这些事听审吗？』

21 但保罗求我留下他，要听皇上审断，我就吩咐把他留下，等我解他到凯撒那里去。」关于非斯都要把保罗送去耶路撒冷的原因，有哪些他没有告诉亚基帕王？

22 亚基帕对非斯都说：「我自己也愿听这人辩论。」非斯都说：「明天你可以听。」保罗又有机会向谁见证他自己的信仰？



###### Notes: 注释：

King Agrippa - was a great grandson of Herod the Great through his Hasmonean wife, Mariamne. The kingdom of Agrippa included considerable territory in the region of Caesarea Philippi, and parts of Galilee, Perea, and Judea. Agrippa was also given jurisdiction over the temple in Jerusalem. He was a sister to Drusilla (wife of Felix) and married to his sister Bernice. Bernice was also the mistress of the general Titus, who destroyed Jerusalem in 70 A.D  and was the emperor from 79-81 A.D.

亚基帕王 -亚基帕王是大希律和他的塔斯马尼亚妻子玛丽安妮的重孙。亚基帕王的国土包括该撒利亚腓立比的大部分地区、加利利的一部分、佩雷亚以及犹太地。亚基帕王也对耶路撒冷的圣殿有管辖权。他是土西拉（腓力斯的妻子）的妹夫，他娶了土西拉的妹妹伯妮斯。伯妮斯还是提多将军的情妇。提多在公元70年摧毁了耶路撒冷，并在公元79-81年做罗马皇帝。

###### Paul Before Agrippa  保罗在亚基帕王面前

23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. How did Agrippa and Bernice enter the room? Who else was in attendance? At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. Who came in? How do you think Paul was dressed? 

24 Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. What had the Jews wanted? 

25 I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome. What does Festus leave out? What had Festus failed to do? 

26 But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Why is this a strange statement to make? Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write. What was Festus hoping would come out of this hearing? 

27 For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”What are your thoughts about Festus?


23 第二天，亚基帕和百妮基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长和城里的尊贵人进了公厅。亚基帕王和百妮基是怎样进来的？还有哪些人也参与了？非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗带进来。 谁被带进来了？你认为保罗这时的穿着怎样？

24 非斯都说：「亚基帕王和在这里的诸位啊，你们看这人，就是一切犹太人，在耶路撒冷和这里，曾向我恳求、呼叫说：『不可容他再活着。』犹太人求什么？

25 但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪，并且他自己上告于皇帝，所以我定意把他解去。非斯都没有说明什么？非斯都没有做到什么？

26 论到这人，我没有确实的事可以奏明主上。为什么有这样一句不寻常的话？因此，我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在查问之后有所陈奏。非斯都希望这次查问能有什么样的结果？

27 据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪案是不合理的。」你对非斯都有什么看法？
