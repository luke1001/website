##### Acts 12:1-25 使徒行传12:1-25

In chapter 12 the church in Jerusalem is experiencing another outbreak instigated by unbelieving Jews and implemented through King Herod. The king beheaded the apostle James, the first apostle know to have experienced martyrdom. This Herod is a grandson of Herod the Great who ruled at the time of Christ's birth. Herod Agrippa was educated in Rome with the imperial family. He was given additional territory and eventually his kingdom was as large as Herod the Great.

在12章里耶路撒冷的教会在希律王的治下再次经历了来自不信的犹太人的搅扰。希律王砍下了使徒雅各的头，使之成为我们知道的第一个殉道的使徒。这个希律是耶稣降生时期做王的大希律的孙子。希律亚基帕在罗马和皇室子女一起受教育。他得到了额外的领土，并且最终他的王国和大希律一样大。

###### Peter’s Miraculous Escape From Prison 彼得奇妙的脱离监狱

1 It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them. 2 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword. What happened to James? 

3 When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. Who was Herod trying to please? This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread. 

4 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. What was Herod planning?

5 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. How did the believers show concern for Peter?

1 那时，希律王下手苦害教会中几个人，2 用刀杀了约翰的哥哥雅各。雅各遭遇了什么？

3 他见犹太人喜欢这事，又去捉拿彼得。希律要讨谁的喜悦？那时正是除酵的日子。

4 希律拿了彼得，收在监里，交付四班兵丁看守，每班四个人，意思要在逾越节后把他提出来，当着百姓办他。希律有什么计划？

5 于是彼得被囚在监里；教会却为他切切地祷告　神。教会是怎样关心彼得的？

6 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. 7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter’s wrists. Why weren't guards aware of what was happening?

8 Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him. 9 Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. What did Peter think was actually happening? 

10 They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. Describe Peter's escape. 11 Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.” Who did Peter acknowledge as responsible for his rescue? What do you think the Jewish people wanted to have done to Peter?

12 When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. 13 Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door. 14 When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”Why didn't Rhoda let Peter in?

15 “You’re out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”16 But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. 17 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. Why would Peter tell them to be quiet? “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,” he said, and then he left for another place. Why would Peter go to another place?

18 In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 19 After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. How did Herod hold the guards responsible for Peter's escape?

6 希律将要提他出来的前一夜，彼得被两条铁链锁着，睡在两个兵丁当中；看守的人也在门外看守。7 忽然，有主的一个使者站在旁边，屋里有光照耀，天使拍彼得的肋旁，拍醒了他，说：「快快起来！」那铁链就从他手上脱落下来。为什么看守的人毫无觉察？ 

8 天使对他说：「束上带子，穿上鞋。」他就那样做。天使又说：「披上外衣，跟着我来。」9 彼得就出来跟着他，不知道天使所做是真的，只当见了异象。彼得自以为发生了什么事？

10 过了第一层第二层监牢，就来到临街的铁门，那门自己开了。他们出来，走过一条街，天使便离开他去了。请描述彼得的获救。11 彼得醒悟过来，说：「我现在真知道主差遣他的使者，救我脱离希律的手和犹太百姓一切所盼望的。」彼得认识到是谁救他出来的？你认为犹太人想要对彼得怎样？

12 想了一想，就往那称呼马可的约翰、他母亲马利亚家去，在那里有好些人聚集祷告。13 彼得敲外门，有一个使女，名叫罗大，出来探听，14 听得是彼得的声音，就欢喜的顾不得开门，跑进去告诉众人说：「彼得站在门外。」罗大为什么没有立即让彼得进门？

15 他们说：「你是疯了！」使女极力地说：「真是他！」他们说：「必是他的天使！」16 彼得不住地敲门。他们开了门，看见他，就甚惊奇。17 彼得摆手，不要他们作声，彼得为什么让他们不要作声？就告诉他们主怎样领他出监；又说：「你们把这事告诉雅各和众弟兄。」于是出去，往别处去了。彼得为什么要往别处去？

18 到了天亮，兵丁扰乱得很，不知道彼得往哪里去了。19 希律找他，找不着，就审问看守的人，吩咐把他们拉去杀了。希律如何处置看守的彼得的人的？

###### Herod’s Death 希律的死

Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there. 20 He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king’s country for their food supply.  Why did the people of Tyre and Sidon want to meet with Herod?

21 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. 22 They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.” What did the people call Herod? 23 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died. Why did the angel strike Herod down. 24 But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.

19后来希律离开犹太，下凯撒利亚去，住在那里。20 希律恼怒推罗、西顿的人。他们那一带地方是从王的地土得粮，因此就托了王的内侍臣伯拉斯都的情，一心来求和。为什么推罗、西顿的人想要见希律？

21 希律在所定的日子，穿上朝服，坐在位上，对他们讲论一番。22 百姓喊着说：「这是神的声音，不是人的声音。」人们怎么称呼希律的？23 希律不归荣耀给　神，所以主的使者立刻罚他，他被虫所咬，气就绝了。为什么主的使者惩罚希律？24 神的道日见兴旺，越发广传。

###### Barnabas and Saul Sent Off 巴拿巴和扫罗奉差遣

25 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark. What mission were Paul and Barnabas on? (Hint: Acts 11:25-26)To where did they return?

25 巴拿巴和扫罗办完了他们供给的事，就从耶路撒冷回来，带着称呼马可的约翰同去。保罗和巴拿巴在做什么事？(提示:使徒行传11:25-26 )他们将要回到哪里？

###### Notes: 注释

New Testament Tyre and Sidon were prosperous Roman port cities. Early in Jesus’ ministry, people from Sidon and Tyre heard about the things He did. They came to see Him (Mark 3:8) and be healed by Him (Luke 6:17). Later in His ministry, Jesus visited the region of Sidon and Tyre. There He healed the Canaanite (Syrophoenician) woman’s daughter (Matt. 15:21–28; Mark 7:24–31).

新约圣经中推罗和西顿是罗马繁荣的港口城市。在耶稣事工的早期，推罗和西顿的人们听说了耶稣的事。他们来见耶稣(马可福音3:8节) 并得到祂的医治 (路加福音6:17节) 。在耶稣事工的晚期，耶稣曾到推罗和西顿的地方去。在那里，祂医治了迦南（叙利亚人）妇人的女儿（马太福音15:21-28；马可福音7:24-31）
