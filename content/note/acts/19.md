##### Acts 19:1-41 使徒行传 19:1-41

Paul's third journey also originated at Antioch in Syria. How long Paul stayed there after his second journey before setting out a third time is not known. For the most part the third journey covered the same territory as the second one. Since Paul spent three years in Ephesus, the whole trip probably lasted at least four years. When Paul left we do not hear of any travel companions, however, co-workers are present. In chapter 18 Paul traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia. Chapter 19 begins with Paul in Ephesus.

保罗的第三次旅行也是从叙利亚的安提阿启程的。我们并不清楚保罗自结束第二次旅行后等候了多久才开始第三次旅行的。这一次保罗所去的地方和第二次大概一致。我们知道保罗在以弗所住了三年多，因此他这一次旅行至少有四年以上的时间。当保罗启程的时候，我们并不了解他的同伴的详情，但是我们我们确知有人与他同工。在十八章记载了，保罗穿行在加拉太和弗吕家地区。第十九章以保罗在以弗所开始。

###### Paul in Ephesus 保罗在以弗所

1 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. Why did Paul take the road through the interior? There he found some disciples 

2 and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”What question did Paul ask the disciples? They answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”

3 So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?” 
“John’s baptism,” they replied. 
4 Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. What was John's baptism? He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” 

5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. What is the baptism of Jesus? 6 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. 7 There were about twelve men in all. What happened when they were baptized?

1 亚波罗在哥林多的时候，保罗经过了上边一带地方，就来到以弗所；保罗为什么要经过上边一带地方？在那里遇见几个门徒，

2 问他们说：「你们信的时候受了圣灵没有？」保罗向门徒们问什么？他们回答说：「没有，也未曾听见有圣灵赐下来。」

3 保罗说：「这样，你们受的是什么洗呢？」他们说：「是约翰的洗。」4 保罗说：「约翰所行的是悔改的洗，约翰的洗礼是什么意思？告诉百姓当信那在他以后要来的，就是耶稣。」

5 他们听见这话，就奉主耶稣的名受洗。什么是耶稣的洗？

6 保罗按手在他们头上，圣灵便降在他们身上，他们就说方言，又说预言28。

7 一共约有十二个人。当他们受了洗后发生了什么？

8 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. For how long did Paul speak about the kingdom of God? 

9 But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. What is "the Way"? So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. Why did Paul leave and go to the lecture hall of Tyrannus? 

10 This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. What was the result of Paul staying for so long?


8 保罗进会堂，放胆讲道，一连三个月，辩论　神国的事，劝化众人。保罗用了多长时间在那里讲神国的道？

9 后来，有些人心里刚硬不信，在众人面前毁谤这道，“这道”是指什么？保罗就离开他们，也叫门徒与他们分离，便在推喇奴的学房天天辩论。保罗为什么离开并去推嘞奴的学房？

10 这样有两年之久，叫一切住在亚细亚的，无论是犹太人，是希腊人，都听见主的道。保罗住在那里的产生了什么果效？

11 God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, 12 so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. How were some people cured?

13 Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.” Why were some of the Jews invoking the name of Jesus? 14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. 15 One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?” What did the evil spirit know? 16 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. What do we learn about the evil spirit?

11 神借保罗的手行了些非常的奇事；12 甚至有人从保罗身上拿手巾或围裙放在病人身上，病就退了，恶鬼也出去了。人们是怎样得医治的？

13 那时，有几个游行各处、念咒赶鬼的犹太人，向那被恶鬼附的人擅自称主耶稣的名，说：「我奉保罗所传的耶稣敕令你们出来！」为什么这些犹太人要称耶稣的名？

14 做这事的，有犹太祭司长士基瓦的七个儿子。15 恶鬼回答他们说：「耶稣我认识，保罗我也知道。你们却是谁呢？」恶鬼都知道什么？

16 恶鬼所附的人就跳在他们身上，胜了其中二人，制伏他们，叫他们赤着身子受了伤，从那房子里逃出去了。我们对恶鬼有哪些了解？

17 When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Whose name became very important? 

18 Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done. 19 A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. What had some of the believers still practiced? When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. What had some of those who practiced sorcery realized? 

20 In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. What was the result?


17 凡住在以弗所的，无论是犹太人，是希腊人，都知道这事，也都惧怕；主耶稣的名从此就尊大了。谁的名被尊大了？

18 那已经信的，多有人来承认诉说自己所行的事。19 平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。信的人还做过什么事？他们算计书价，便知道共合五万块钱。这些行邪术的认识到了什么？

20 主的道大大兴旺，而且得胜，就是这样。结果如何？

21 After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. Where was Paul going to go next? “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit Rome also.” What were Paul's future travel plans? 

22 He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. Where were Timothy and Erastus going?


21 这些事完了，保罗心里定意经过了马其顿、亚该亚，就往耶路撒冷去；保罗之后又计划往哪里去？又说：「我到了那里以后，也必须往罗马去看看。」保罗对未来的旅行计划是什么？

22 于是从帮助他的人中打发提摩太、以拉都二人往马其顿去，自己暂时等在亚细亚。提摩太和以拉都要往哪里去？

###### Notes: 注释：

Lecture hall of Tyrannus - Tyrannus was philosopher 

推喇奴的学房 － 推喇奴是当时的一位哲学家

A drachma was a silver coin worth about a day’s wages.

五万块钱 －一块钱银币的价值相当于一天的工资。

###### The Riot in Ephesus 以弗所的暴动

23 About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. Why do you think there was a disturbance about the Christian teachings? 

24 A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there. What do you know about Demetrius? 

25 He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: “You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business. How did these craftsmen earn a living? 

26 And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. How do you know Paul was successful in his teaching?  

27 There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.”What was Demetrius upset about?  


23 那时，因为这道起的扰乱不小。你认为为什么基督教的教导会引起扰乱？

24 有一个银匠，名叫底米丢，是制造亚底米神银龛的，他使这样手艺人生意发达。你对底米丢有哪些了解？

25 他聚集他们和同行的工人，说：「众位，你们知道我们是倚靠这生意发财。这些手艺人靠什么为生？

26 这保罗不但在以弗所，也几乎在亚细亚全地，引诱迷惑许多人，说：『人手所做的，不是神。』这是你们所看见所听见的。你怎样得知保罗的教导是否成功？

27 这样，不独我们这事业被人藐视，就是大女神亚底米的庙也要被人轻忽，连亚细亚全地和普天下所敬拜的大女神之威荣也要消灭了。」底米丢为什么事而感到气愤？

28 When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 29 Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the theater together. What happened to two of Paul's companions? 

30 Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. 31 Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. What message was being sent to Paul?

32 The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. Describe the scene. 33 The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. What was Alexander trying to accomplish? 

34 But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” What was the crowd's response?


28 众人听见，就怒气填胸，喊着说：「大哉，以弗所人的亚底米啊！」29 满城都轰动起来。众人拿住与保罗同行的马其顿人该犹和亚里达古，齐心拥进戏园里去。保罗的同伴遭遇了什么？

30 保罗想要进去，到百姓那里，门徒却不许他去。31 还有亚细亚几位首领，是保罗的朋友，打发人来劝他，不要冒险到戏园里去。人们给保罗带了什么信？

32 聚集的人纷纷乱乱，有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的；大半不知道是为什么聚集。请描绘当时的情形。33 有人把亚历山大从众人中带出来，犹太人推他往前，亚历山大就摆手，要向百姓分诉；亚历山大要做什么？

34 只因他们认出他是犹太人，就大家同声喊着说：「大哉！以弗所人的亚底米啊。」如此约有两小时。众人是如何回应的？

35 The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? What does the city clerk tell us about the goddess Artemis? 

36 Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do anything rash. 37 You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. How does the clerk describe Paul? 

38 If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. How should the matter be decided? 

39 If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. What did the city clerk insist must happen?  

40 As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today. What was the clerk afraid would happen? In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.” 

41 After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. What happened after the clerk spoke?


35 那城里的书记安抚了众人，就说：「以弗所人哪，谁不知道以弗所人的城是看守大亚底米的庙和从宙斯那里落下来的像呢？城里的书记的话使我们对大亚底米有哪些了解？

36 这事既是驳不倒的，你们就当安静，不可造次。37 你们把这些人带来，他们并没有偷窃庙中之物，也没有谤我们的女神。这个书记怎样讲论保罗的？

38 若是底米丢和他同行的人有控告人的事，自有放告的日子29，也有方伯可以彼此对告。这个事件应当怎样处理？

39 你们若问别的事，就可以照常例聚集断定。城里的书记要求怎样处理这件事？

40 今日的扰乱本是无缘无故，这个书记担心会发生什么事？我们难免被查问。论到这样聚众，我们也说不出所以然来。」

41 说了这话，便叫众人散去。这个书记说完话后，事情有怎样的结果？

###### Notes: 注释：

Artemis - The goddess Artemis was worshiped more widely among the Greeks than any other deity (known as Diana among the Romans). Ephesus was the focal point for countless tourists and pilgrims who visited the magnificent temple each year. The visitors purchased souvenirs manufactured by silversmiths and other craftsmen? There was a spring festival devoted to the worship of Artemis which included athletic, dramatic, and musical contests.

亚底米 － 希腊人对女神亚底米的崇拜超过其它一切神祇（罗马人称其为雅典娜）。每年无数游客和朝觐者涌向以弗所来拜访这里的宏伟的神庙。人们购买很多银匠和其他手艺人所做的纪念品。在每年春季有专为崇拜亚底米的盛大节日，包括有体育、戏剧和音乐会等。
