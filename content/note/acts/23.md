##### Acts 23:1-35 使徒行传23:1-35

Paul was no longer bound. This is not a trial, but rather an informal hearing with both the men of the Sanhedrin and Paul present. Paul had probably been asked to make an opening statement and immediately the high priest Ananias ordered Paul to be struck in the mouth.

保罗不再被捆绑。这并不是审判，而是非正式的听取公会和保罗的分述。保罗可能被要求做公开的声明，但是大祭司亚拿尼亚立即吩咐人打他的嘴。

1 Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.” What did Paul tell the Sanhedrin?

2 At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. What was ordered? Why? 

3 Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! What is a whitewashed wall? What does whitewash cover? You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!”What did Paul's reply mean?

4 Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high priest!” What was Paul told? 5 Paul replied, “Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’ (Exodus 22:28)”

1 保罗定睛看着公会的人，说：「弟兄们，我在　神面前行事为人都是凭着良心，直到今日。」保罗告诉公会的人什么实情？

2 大祭司亚拿尼亚就吩咐旁边站着的人打他的嘴。这是什么命令，为什么？

3 保罗对他说：「你这粉饰的墙，　神要打你！什么是粉饰的墙？粉饰要遮掩什么？你坐堂为的是按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我吗？」保罗的回答意味着什么？

4 站在旁边的人说：「你辱骂　神的大祭司吗？」保罗被告知什么？5 保罗说：「弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司；经上记着说：『不可毁谤你百姓的官长。』」（出埃及记22:28）

6 Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, What do you remember about the Pharisees and the Sadducees? called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.” What did Paul tell them? 

7 When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. What broke out at this informal hearing? 

8 (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.) Why did a dispute break out?

9 There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this man,” they said. What did the Pharisees find? “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” Who might have talked with Paul 

10 The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. What was happening in the dispute? He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks. What were the troops ordered?

11 The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, “Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.” What message did Paul receive from the Lord?


6 保罗看出大众一半是撒都该人，一半是法利赛人，你对法利赛人和撒都该人还有哪些映像？就在公会中大声说：「弟兄们，我是法利赛人，也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问，是为盼望死人复活。」保罗对他们说了什么？

7 说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人就争论起来，会众分为两党。在这个非正式的分述上发生了什么争执？

8 因为撒都该人说，没有复活，也没有天使和鬼魂；法利赛人却说，两样都有。为什么会发生这样的争执？

9 于是大大地喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来争辩说：「我们看不出这人有什么恶处，这些法利赛人说明了什么？倘若有鬼魂或是天使对他说过话，怎么样呢？」谁可能向保罗说话？

10 那时大起争吵，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，在这争端中发生了什么事？就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。兵丁得到什么命令？

11 当夜，主站在保罗旁边，说：「放心吧！你怎样在耶路撒冷为我作见证，也必怎样在罗马为我作见证。」保罗从主那里得到什么信息？

###### The Plot to Kill Paul 杀害保罗的阴谋

12 The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. What was the conspiracy? 13 More than forty men were involved in this plot. How many were involved in the plot? 14 They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. Who did these forty Jews go to? 15 Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here.” What was the plan? When else have we learned of a plot to kill an innocent man?

16 But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. Who learned of the plot? Why was it easy for the young man to see Paul?
   17 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.” Where did Paul want his nephew taken? 18 So he took him to the commander.
   The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”
   19 The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What is it you want to tell me?” How did the commander handle the situation?

20 He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him. 21 Don’t give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request.” How soon was the attack going to happen?

22 The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone that you have reported this to me.” Why would the young man receive that warning?

12 到了天亮，犹太人同谋起誓，说：「若不先杀保罗就不吃不喝。」犹太人的计谋是什么？

13 这样同心起誓的有四十多人。有多少人一同起誓？

14 他们来见祭司长和长老，说：「我们已经起了一个大誓，若不先杀保罗就不吃什么。这四十个犹太人去见谁？

15 现在你们和公会要知会千夫长，叫他带下保罗到你们这里来，假作要详细察考他的事；我们已经预备好了，不等他来到跟前就杀他。」这个详细计划是怎样的？我们还曾在什么时候看到过一个杀害无辜人的计谋？

16 保罗的外甥听见他们设下埋伏，就来到营楼里告诉保罗。谁知道了这个计谋？为什么这个年轻人可以轻易的见保罗？

17 保罗请一个百夫长来，说：「你领这少年人去见千夫长，他有事告诉他。」保罗想让他外甥去哪里？

18 于是把他领去见千夫长，说：「被囚的保罗请我到他那里，求我领这少年人来见你；他有事告诉你。」19 千夫长就拉着他的手，走到一旁，私下问他说：「你有什么事告诉我呢？」千夫长怎么处理这个情况的？

20 他说：「犹太人已经约定，要求你明天带下保罗到公会里去，假作要详细查问他的事。21 你切不要随从他们；因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓说，若不先杀保罗就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。」犹太人的计谋还有多久就要实现？

22于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说：「不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。」年轻人在此为什么被提醒？
   
###### Paul Transferred to Caesarea 保罗被解交到凯撒利亚

23 Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight. 24 Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.” How is the commander going to ensure Paul's safety? Where is Paul going? Caesarea is 110 kilometers (68 miles)from Jerusalem.

25 He wrote a letter as follows: 26 Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings. 27 This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen. How did the commander change his story?  

28 I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin. 29 I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment. What did the commander say he found out?  What didn't the commander include in the report? 

30 When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him. Who else is going to come to Caesarea?

31 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris. 67 kilometers (42 miles) 32 The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks. 33 When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him. Who did the cavalry turn Paul over to? 

34 The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, 35 he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.”Why did Governor Felix decide to hear the case? Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace. Was Paul kept in chains or as a prisoner? Why?


23 千夫长便叫了两个百夫长来，说：「预备步兵二百，马兵七十，长枪手二百，今夜亥初往凯撒利亚去；24 也要预备牲口叫保罗骑上，护送到巡抚腓力斯那里去。」千夫长如何确保保罗的安全？保罗要被送去哪里？凯撒利亚距离耶路撒冷110公里（68英里）

25 千夫长又写了文书，26 大略说：「克劳第·吕西亚，请巡抚腓力斯大人安。27 这人被犹太人拿住，将要杀害，我得知他是罗马人，就带兵丁下去救他出来。千夫长编造了什么事实？

28 因要知道他们告他的缘故，我就带他下到他们的公会去，29 便查知他被告是因他们律法的辩论，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。千夫长说他查明了什么事实？他在信中没有说明什么？

30 后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我，我就立时解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人在你面前告他。」还有谁将要去凯撒利亚？

31 于是，兵丁照所吩咐他们的，将保罗夜里带到安提帕底。67公里（42英里）32 第二天，让马兵护送，他们就回营楼去。33 马兵来到凯撒利亚，把文书呈给巡抚，便叫保罗站在他面前。马兵把保罗交给了谁？

34 巡抚看了文书，问保罗是哪省的人，既晓得他是基利家人，35 就说：「等告你的人来到，我要细听你的事」；巡抚腓力斯为什么要细听这件事？便吩咐人把他看守在希律的衙门里。保罗现在是否被锁链困锁或是被看作囚犯？为什么？
       
###### Notes: 注释：

Governor Felix - Felix as governor of Judea would have jurisdiction, since Paul had been arrested in Jerusalem. But if Paul, a native of Cilicia, had been guilty of insurrection, Roman law required Felix turn the case over to the governor of Syria because Cilicia was under his rule. But the commander's letter had contained no hint of Paul been an agitator or rebel against Rome.


巡抚腓力斯 - 腓力斯作为犹太地的巡抚应该对这件事有管辖权，因为保罗是在耶路撒冷被捆绑的。但如果保罗，作为基利家人，犯了叛乱的罪，罗马法律规定腓力斯需要把这件事交给叙利亚的巡抚来处理，因为基利家在叙利亚巡抚的治下。然而，百夫长的信件并没有指出保罗有鼓动叛乱的行为。

A letter - In accord with Roman law, the commander, Claudius Lysias, was required to submit a written statement when he referred a prisoner to governor Felix.

文书 - 根据罗马律法，千夫长，克劳第·吕西亚，移交囚犯给巡抚腓力斯时需要提交一份书面证明。
