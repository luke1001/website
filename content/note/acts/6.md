##### Acts 6: 1-15 使徒行传 6：1-15

A considerable length of time may have transpired since the end of chapter 5. The church continued to grow, but this gave rise to inevitable problems, both from within and from without. At this stage of its development the church was entirely Jewish in its composition.

从第五章结束（到第六章）有相当长一段时间。教会继续增长，但是这也导致了不可避免的问题，教会内部的和来自教会外的。在教会的这个发展阶段，教会的会众全是犹太人。

###### The Choosing of the Seven 拣选七执事

1 In those days when the number of disciples Why were the early Christians called disciples? was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. What problem has developed? 2 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. What were the Apostles trying to correct at what cost? 3 Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 4 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.” What was the solution? What were the qualifications of the seven?

5 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 6 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.

6:1那时，门徒增多，为什么早期基督徒被称为门徒？有说希利尼话的犹太人，向希伯来人发怨言。因为在天天的供给上忽略了他们的寡妇。出现了什么问题？6:2十二使徒叫众门徒来，对他们说，我们撇下神的道，去管理饭食，原是不合宜的。使徒们试图要纠正什么，以什么代价？6:3所以弟兄们，当从你们中间选出七个有好名声，被圣灵充满，智慧充足的人，我们就派他们管理这事。6:4但我们要专心以祈祷传道为事。解决方法是什么？七执事要符合什么标准？

6:5大众都喜悦这话，就拣选了司提反，乃是大有信心，圣灵充满的人，又拣选腓利，伯罗哥罗，尼迦挪，提门，巴米拿，并进犹太教的安提阿人尼哥拉。6:6叫他们站在使徒面前。使徒祷告了，就按手在他们头上。

7 So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith. What was the result of the Apostles having additional time (not waiting on tables)? Who are the priests?

6:7神的道兴旺起来。在耶路撒冷门徒数目加增的甚多。也有许多祭司信从了这道。使徒们有了更多的时间（不用管理饭食），这带来什么好的结果？祭司是谁？

###### Notes: 注释

Hellenistic Jews - Jews who were born in lands other than Palestine and adopted the Greek language and culture.

- Greek was an increasingly common language. The Old Testament had been translated into Greek before Christ was born to accommodate the Greek speaking Jews need to hear the Bible in their own language. That version is known as the Septuagint.

说希利尼话的犹太人 --- 出生于巴勒斯坦以外地区的犹太人，他们接受了希利尼的语言和文化。

- 希腊语（希利尼话）是一门日益普遍的语言。在基督降世以先旧约就被翻译为希利尼语，这是为了让那些说希利尼话的犹太人可以用自己的语言来听圣经。那个版本的旧约被称为是七十士译本。

Hebraic Jews - Those who spoke the Aramaic and/or Hebrew languages of Palestine and preserved Jewish culture and customs.

希伯来人 --- 那些讲巴勒斯坦的亚兰文和/或希伯来语的人，并保留了犹太文化和习俗。

Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism - All seven , including Stephen, have Greek names; suggesting that they were chosen from the Greek-speaking part of the congregation from where the criticism had come. Nicolas was a former Gentile, a convert to Judaism before becoming a Christian. We will learn more about Philip is Acts 8.

腓利，伯罗哥罗，尼迦挪，提门，巴米拿，并进犹太教的安提阿人尼哥拉 --- 这七个人，包括司提反，都有希腊文名字；这说明他们都是从说希利尼话的会众中选出来的，最开始的抱怨也是从说希利尼话的会众中来的。尼哥拉是一个外邦人，在成为一个基督徒之前又转为犹太教。我们会在使徒行传8中学到关于腓利的事情。

Laid their hands on them - Laying on of hands was used to confer a blessing.

按手在他们头上--- 按手礼被用来赐福。


###### Stephen Seized 司提反被捉拿

8 Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. What ability did Stephen have? 9 Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen. 10 But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke. What were these men unable to do?

11 Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”Who did the Freedmen bring in and what was the charge?

12 So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. What is another name for the teachers of the law? They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. What is the Sanhedrin? 13 They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law. What is the holy place? What is the law? 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us.” Who else had this charge brought against Him?

15 All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel. What does it mean to have a face like and angel?

6:8司提反满得恩惠能力，在民间行了大奇事和神迹。司提反有了什么能力？6:9当时有称利百地拿会堂的几个人，并有古利奈，亚力山太，基利家，亚西亚，各处会堂的几个人，都起来，和司提反辩论。6:10司提反是以智慧和圣灵说话，众人敌挡不住。这些人没能做什么？

6:11就买出人来说，我们听见他说谤？？摩西，和神的话。这些利百地拿会堂的人将谁牵扯进来，给出了什么控告？

6:12他们又耸动了百姓，长老，并文士，文士的另一个称呼是什么？就忽然来捉拿他，把他带到公会去，什么是犹太会众？6:13设下假见证说，这个人说话，不住地糟践圣所和律法。什么是圣所？什么是律法？6:14我们曾听见他说，这拿撒勒人耶稣，要毁坏此地，也要改变摩西所交给我们的规条。谁也受到这样的控告？

6:15在公会里坐着的人，都定睛看他，见他的面貌，好像天使的面貌。面貌好像天使，这指的是什么意思？

###### Notes: 注释

Freedmen - Persons who had been freed from slavery. Most likely they had been prisoners of war. They came from different areas.

利百地拿 --- 从奴役中解脱出来的自由人。很可能他们曾是战犯。他们来自不同的地方。
