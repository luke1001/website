##### Acts 3:1-26  使徒行传 3：1-26 

Jesus promised (Mark 16:15-19) His Apostles before His ascension that He would grant them power to perform miracles. In chapter 3, we read of the first miracle performed by one of the Apostles (men who are sent) after Jesus ascension. All the miracles performed by the Apostles in the name of Jesus were in the service of His Gospel, for the spreading of His saving Word. We will read of a conflict between the Sanhedrin (Jewish governing body) and Peter after Peter healed a crippled man. 

在马可福音16：15-19中，耶稣在升天前告诉祂的门徒们祂会赐给他们行神迹的能力。在第三章中，我们会读到耶稣升天后由使徒（被差的人）所行的第一个神迹。使徒们奉耶稣的名所行的神迹都是为了服务于福音，为了传扬祂救赎的话语。 我们会读到在彼得治愈了一个瘸腿的人后发生的一场在他和犹太会堂（犹太人的管理机构）之间的争执。

###### Peter Heals a Lame Beggar 彼得治愈一个瘸腿的乞丐 

1 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon. Why were Peter and John at the temple? What did they no longer need to perform? Why? 

2 Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. For how long was the man lame? On whose mercy was the man depending? 

3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. 4 Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Why do you think they stared at the man? Then Peter said, “Look at us!” 5 So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. What was the beggar expecting? 

3:1 申初祷告的时候，彼得，约翰，上圣殿去。彼得和约翰为什么会在圣殿？他们不需要再做什么？为什么？ 

3:2 有一个人，生来是瘸腿的，天天被人抬来，放在殿的一个门口，那门名叫美门，要求进殿的人周济。这个人瘸腿已经有多久了？这个人靠谁的恩惠来为生？ 

3:3 他看见彼得约翰将要进殿，就求他们周济。 3:4 彼得约翰定睛看他。你认为他们为什么盯着他看？彼得说，你看我们。 3:5 那人就留意看他们，指望得着什么。这个乞丐在期待什么？

6 Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.”In whose name did Peter command the man to walk.In whose name did Jesus perform miracles (John 1:14)? 

7 Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 8 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. Describe in detail what just happened? 

9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God, What was the man’s first response? 10 they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. Do you think the people should have been surprised? Explain 

3:6 彼得说，金银我都没有，只把我所有的给你，我奉拿撒勒人耶稣基督的名，叫你起来行走。彼得奉谁的名叫这人起来行走？耶稣奉谁的名行神迹（约翰福音1：14）？ 

3:7 于是拉着他的右手，扶他起来，他的脚和踝子骨，立刻健壮了。 3:8 就跳起来，站着，又行走。同他们进了殿，走着，跳着，赞美神。请详细描述一下这里发生了什么事？

3:9 百姓都看见他行走，赞美神。这人的第一反应是什么？ 3:10 认得他是那素常坐在殿的美门口求周济的，就因他所遇着的事，满心希奇惊讶。

###### Notes: 注释 

Up to the temple - the Temple was built on Mount Moriah, the highest point in the city. 

上圣殿去 — 圣殿建在城的最高点摩利亚山上。

Temple gate called Beautiful - This gate led into the Court of the Women. It was called “beautiful” because it was the most elaborately and artistically embellished gate. 

这门名叫美门—这门通向女院。它之所以被称为美门是因为它最精心最艺术的装饰。

###### Peter Speaks to the Onlookers 彼得对旁观的百姓说教 

11 While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. What is Solomon’s Colonnade? Why would the people come running? 

12 When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why did Peter ask the question? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? 

13 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. What did Peter want to make clear? Why would Peter say “God of our fathers” You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. What strong connection is Peter trying to make? 

14 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. What additional connection is Peter making? 

15 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. What else does Peter want the people to understand? 

16 By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see. In whom did the man believe? What is the purpose for preaching of the Law and the Gospel in vs. 13-16?

 3:11 那人正在称为所罗门的廊下，拉着彼得，约翰。众百姓一齐跑到他们那里，很觉希奇。所罗门的廊是什么？为什么众百姓都一齐跑来？ 

3:12 彼得看见，就对百姓说，以色列人哪，为什么把这事当作希奇呢？彼得为什么问这个问题？为什么定睛看我们，以为我们凭自己的能力和虔诚，使这人行走呢？ 

3:13 亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各的神，就是我们列祖的神，已经荣耀了他的仆人耶稣。彼得要澄清什么？彼得为什么说“我们列祖的神”？（仆人或作儿子）你们却把他交付彼拉多。彼拉多定意要释放他，你们竟在彼拉多面前弃绝了他。彼得要将什么紧紧联系在一起？ 

3:14 你们弃绝了那圣洁公义者，反求着释放一个凶手给你们。彼得又做了什么联系？ 

3:15 你们杀了那生命的主，神却叫他从死里复活了。我们都是为这事作见证。彼得还想让人们知道什么？ 

3:16 我们因信他的名，他的名便叫你们所看见所认识的这人，健壮了。正是他所赐的信心，叫这人在你们众人面前全然好了。这人信谁？在13-16节中传讲律法与福音的目的是什么？

17 “Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. 18 But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer. What had been foretold? 

19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, Why should the people repent (law)? Explain “repent”. What will the people receive? 

20 and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus. What will the people receive (Gospel)? 

21 Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. What has God promised? 

22 For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. Read Deuteronomy 18: 18-19. What connection is Peter making? 

23 Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.’ What will happen to the people who do not believe? 

3:17 弟兄们，我晓得你们作这事，是出于不知，你们的官长也是如此。 3:18 但神曾借众先知的口，预言基督将要受害，就这样应验了。预言了什么？ 

3:19 所以你们当悔改归正，使你们的罪得以涂抹，这样，那安舒的日子，就必从主面前来到。人为什么要悔改（律法）？解释“悔改”。人们会得到什么？ 

3:20 主也必差遣所预定给你们的基督耶稣降临。人会得到什么（福音）？ 

3:21 天必留他，等到万物复兴的时候，就是神从创世以来，借着圣先知的口所说的。神应许了什么？ 

3:22 摩西曾说，主神要从你们弟兄中间，给你们兴起一位先知像我，凡他向你们所说的，你们都要听从。请读申命记18：18-19. 彼得在做什么联系？ 

3:23 凡不听从那先知的，必要从民中全然灭绝。不信的人会发生什么事？

24 “Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days. Read @ Samuel 7:12-13. What has been foretold? 

25 And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.’ What promise was given to Abraham? 

26 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.” To whom did God first send Jesus? 

3:24 从撒母耳以来的众先知，凡说预言的，也都说到这些日子。请读撒母耳记下7：12-13. 预言了什么？ 

3:25 你们是先知的子孙，也承受神与你们祖宗所立的约，就是对亚伯拉罕说，地上万族，都要因你的后裔得福。神给了亚伯拉罕什么应许？ 

3:26 神既兴起他的仆人，（或作儿子）就先差他到你们这里来，赐福给你们，叫你们各人回转，离开罪恶。神将耶稣先差到谁那里去？

###### Notes: 注释: 

Solomon’s Colonnade - This was the covered portion of the temple which extended along the eastern edge. It was some distance from the gate called Beautiful. It was customary for Jews and Gentiles to assemble there.

所罗门的廊—延伸在圣殿的东面，有所覆盖的廊子。距美门有些距离。通常犹太人和外邦人在这里聚集。
