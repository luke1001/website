##### Acts 18:1-28 使徒行传 18:1-28

From Athens Paul traveled to Corinth, about 97 kilometers (60 miles) to the west. Before reaching Corinth Paul would have passed the site where the athletic events known as the Isthmian Games were held every 2 years. These ranked second in importance to the Olympic Games.

保罗从雅典向西往哥林多去，行程97公里（60英里）。在他抵达哥林多之前可能会经过哥林多地峡运动会举办的地方。这个运动会每两年举办一次。被誉为是仅次于奥林匹克的运动会。

###### In Corinth 在哥林多

1 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Why were Aquila and Priscilla in Corinth? Paul went to see them, 

3 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. Why did Paul work? 

4 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks. How did Paul spend his Saturdays?

1 这事以后，保罗离了雅典，来到哥林多。2 遇见一个犹太人，名叫亚居拉，他生在本都；因为克劳第命犹太人都离开罗马，新近带着妻百基拉，从意大利来。亚居拉和百基拉为什么会在哥林多？保罗就投奔了他们。

3 他们本是制造帐棚为业。保罗因与他们同业，就和他们同住做工。保罗为什么要做工？

4 每逢安息日，保罗在会堂里辩论，劝化犹太人和希腊人。保罗在安息日时做什么？

5 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. Why do you think it took Silas and Timothy such a long time to meet up with Paul?  (Hint: I Thessalonians 3:1-8 This is a letter Paul wrote to the Thessalonians' congregation) 6 But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” What was Paul's reaction to the Jews who were abusive?


5 西拉和提摩太从马其顿来的时候，保罗为道迫切，向犹太人证明耶稣是基督。你认为为什么西拉和提摩太为什么花了这么长时间才和保罗见面？（提示：帖撒罗尼迦前书3:1-8，这是保罗写给帖撒罗尼迦人的书信）

6 他们既抗拒、毁谤，保罗就抖着衣裳，说：「你们的罪归到你们自己头上，与我无干。从今以后，我要往外邦人那里去。」保罗是如何回应犹太人的辱骂的？

7 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. What did we learn the phrase "a worshiper of God" meant? 

8 Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; What do we learn about Crispus? and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.

9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent. 10 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.” What message did the Lord give to Paul in a vision? Why? 

11 So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God. What did Paul do while staying in Corinth for a year and a half?

7 于是离开那里，到了一个人的家中；这人名叫提多·犹士都，是敬拜　神的，他的家靠近会堂。我们从“是敬拜神的”这句话中可以知道哪些信息？

8 管会堂的基利司布和全家都信了主，我们对基利司布有哪些了解？还有许多哥林多人听了，就相信受洗。

9 夜间，主在异象中对保罗说：「不要怕，只管讲，不要闭口，10 有我与你同在，必没有人下手害你，因为在这城里我有许多的百姓。」主在异象中给保罗什么样的指示？为什么？

11 保罗在那里住了一年零六个月，将　神的道教训他们。保罗住在哥林多的一年半中都做了什么事？

12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment. 13 “This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.” What was the charge?

14 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you. 15 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.” What was Gallio's decision? 

16 So he drove them off. 17 Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever. What happened to Sosthenes the synagogue leader?

12 到迦流作亚该亚方伯的时候，犹太人同心起来攻击保罗，拉他到公堂，13 说：「这个人劝人不按着律法敬拜　神。」控告的原因是什么？

14 保罗刚要开口，迦流就对犹太人说：「你们这些犹太人！如果是为冤枉或奸恶的事，我理当耐性听你们。15 但所争论的，若是关乎言语、名目，和你们的律法，你们自己去办吧！这样的事我不愿意审问」；迦流做了怎样的审判？

16 就把他们撵出公堂。17 众人便揪住管会堂的所提尼，在堂前打他。这些事迦流都不管。管会堂的所提尼遭遇了什么事？

###### Notes: 注释

Corinth - was a strategic port city and a prosperous commercial center. Corinth had been destroyed by the Romans in 146 B.C. because of its opposition to Roman rule. The population was either killed or sold into slavery. In 44 B.C. Julius Caesar ordered that Corinth be rebuilt as a Roman colony. The population consisted of liberated slaves and ex-service soldiers from Italy, Roman officials, businessmen, and craftsmen. Corinth was well known for its pottery and brass. The Corinth of Paul's time had the reputation of being excessively immoral. Ritual prostitution in the temple of Aphrodite was common. It is reported that there were more than a thousand slaves who engaged in the practice of prostitution.


哥林多 - 是一个重要的战略港口和繁荣的商业中心。公元前146年，哥林多曾因反抗罗马的统治而被罗马人摧毁。当时的人口或是被杀或被卖为奴隶。公元前44年，尤利乌斯·恺撒重建哥林多城作为罗马的殖民地。居住在当地的是获得自由的奴隶、从意大利退役的军人、罗马官员、商人和手工艺者。哥林多以陶器和铜器闻名。在保罗时代的哥林多城还以有极端的不道德出名。在维纳斯神庙里就蓄有庙妓。据载，当时有千余名奴隶从事卖淫。

Titius Justus - Titius Justus was Gentile convert to Judaism who had been worshipping with the Jews prior to his becoming a Christian.


提多·犹士都 - 提多·犹士都是皈依犹太教的外邦人，在他成为基督徒之前是和犹太人一起敬拜的。

Gallio - From an inscription found near Delphi, Gallio was proconsul from 52-53. Gallio was the brother of philosopher Seneca, who was a tutor of Nero. Later he was executed by Nero for involvement in a plot to overthrow the emperor.


迦流 - 根据在特耳菲发现的碑文记载，迦流在52-53年间做方伯。迦流是哲学家塞尼加的兄弟。塞尼加是尼禄的老师。后来迦流因卷入一场推翻皇帝的阴谋而被尼禄处决。

###### Priscilla, Aquila and Apollos 百基拉、亚居拉和亚波罗

18 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Who traveled with Paul? What was in Syria? Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken. Why would Paul end his vow? 

19 They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 20 When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined. Who wanted Paul to spend more time with them? 

21 But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus. Who stayed behind  in Ephesus?

22 When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch. Jerusalem was high above sea level which is why people went "up" to Jerusalem.

18 保罗又住了多日，就辞别了弟兄，坐船往叙利亚去；百基拉、亚居拉和他同去。谁和保罗同行？叙利亚有什么事发生？他因为许过愿，就在坚革哩剪了头发。保罗为什么要还愿？

19 到了以弗所，保罗就把他们留在那里，自己进了会堂，和犹太人辩论。20 众人请他多住些日子，他却不允，谁想要保罗多住些日子？

21 就辞别他们，说：「　神若许我，我还要回到你们这里」；于是开船离了以弗所。谁留在了以弗所？

22 在凯撒利亚下了船，就上耶路撒冷去问教会安，随后下安提阿去。因为耶路撒冷城建在海平面以上，所以人们说“上”耶路撒冷。

23 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. This is the beginning of Paul's third missionary journey. Why did Paul make this trip?

24 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. What do we learn about Apollos? 

25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. What does it mean to know only the baptism of John?

26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately. What do you think Priscilla and Aquila shared with Apollos?


23 住了些日子，又离开那里，挨次经过加拉太和弗吕家地方，坚固众门徒。这是保罗第三次旅行传道的起始。保罗为什么开始这次旅行呢？

24 有一个犹太人，名叫亚波罗，来到以弗所。他生在亚历山大，是有学问的，最能讲解圣经。我们对亚波罗有哪些了解？

25 这人已经在主的道上受了教训，心里火热，将耶稣的事详细讲论教训人；只是他单晓得约翰的洗礼。“单晓得约翰的洗礼”是什么意思？

26 他在会堂里放胆讲道；百基拉、亚居拉听见，就接他来，将　神的道给他讲解更加详细。你认为百基拉和亚居拉会给亚波罗讲解什么信息？

27 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. What cities were in the region of Achaia? When he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed. 28 For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah. What message did Apollos bring with him?

27 他想要往亚该亚去，弟兄们就勉励他，并写信请门徒接待他。亚该亚都有哪些城市？他到了那里，多帮助那蒙恩信主的人，28 在众人面前极有能力驳倒犹太人，引圣经证明耶稣是基督。亚波罗带来了什么样的信息？

Notes:注释
Vow - The vow involved letting one's hair grow for an extended period of time. It is likely that Paul during the difficult period in Corinth made such a vow.
许愿 - 许愿包含在一定时期不减头发。保罗可能在哥林多城经历困难的时候许过愿。

Ephesus - Leading commercial city of Asia Minor, the capital of provincial Asia. It boasted a pagan temple to the Roman goddess Diana one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

以弗所 - 小亚细亚地区的重要商业城市，亚细亚行省的首府。它以罗马女神雅典娜的生面而著名。雅典娜神庙是古代世界的七大奇观之一。

Baptism of John - It is generally believed that many of John the Baptist's disciples left after his death, telling those who they met what they knew of John and Jesus.
约翰的洗礼 - 人们通常认为，在施洗约翰死后，他的很多门徒四散离开并向所遇见的人传讲关于约翰和耶稣的事。
