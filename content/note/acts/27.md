##### Acts 27: 1-44 使徒行传 27:1-44

Festus had decided that there was nothing further he could do in Paul's case. When Paul left for Rome, he was but one of many persons aboard the ship, and a prisoner at that. As the journey continued the apostle's role became increasingly important as God wanted Paul to arrive in Rome as His apostolic witness in that capital (See Acts 23:11). Luke's account of this dramatic voyage is acknowledged by marine experts to be one of the most vivid and instructive ancient documents available about navigation in New Testament times.

非斯都决定关于保罗的事他没有什么可做的了。当保罗出发去罗马的时候，是和一群囚犯一起，以一个囚犯的身份登船的。随着他的行程，使徒保罗的角色更加重要了，因为神要使保罗抵达罗马，成为神在首都的使徒见证人（使徒行传23:1-44）。路加对此次航行的记载激动人心，同时也被海事专家认为是在新约圣经时代中对航海记载的最生动详实的古代文献。


During his journey to Rome, Paul rode on three ships. The first one took him from Caesarea to Myra in the province of Lycia in the southwestern corner of Asia Minor. The second one, a grain vessel, carried him from Myra to the island of Crete and then over to the island of Malta (Melita) about 97 kilometers (sixty miles) south of Sicily, where the ship was torn apart by the raging storm when its bow became imbedded in a sandbar. The third ship transported Paul from Malta to Syracuse and on to Puteoli in the Bay of Naples, Italy. From Puteoli Paul traveled to Rome on foot.

在保罗去罗马的旅程里，他共乘坐了三艘船。第一艘船载他自该撒利亚启程到了吕家省的每拉，位于小亚细亚的西南角。第二艘是运粮船，带他自每拉到克里特岛，之后又经过马耳他岛 (Melita) ，这座岛位于西西里以南约97公里（60英里）。这艘船在这里陷在沙洲中并被狂风大浪摧毁。第三艘船带保罗自马耳他到了叙拉古。接着又到了意大利那不勒斯海湾的部丢利。保罗从部丢利经陆路抵达罗马。

###### Paul Sails for Rome 保罗坐船往罗马

1 When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. Who is "we" in verse one?What is a centurion? 

2 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Where was the ship headed? Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. Who else was with Paul and Luke?

3 The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. What was Paul allowed? Why? What had Paul won from Julius? 

4 From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. Why do you think they did not sail in the open waters from Sidon to Myra? 

5 When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. 6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. What had the centurion arranged? 

7 We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. What did the wind not allow? 

8 We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. What do we learn about this ship from verses 37 & 38?  The plan had been to take a course through the Greek islands to the north of Crete. But the strong wind from the northmade them sail past Cape Salmone and into the port of Fair Havens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

9 Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Day of Atonement. Why was it becoming dangerous? So Paul warned them, 

10 “Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.” What did Paul warn 

11 But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. Whose advice did the centurion follow? Why do you think he didn't listen to Paul? 

12 Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. Why was it decided not to winter in Fair Havens? This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. Find where you think Phoenix was located.

1非斯都既然定规了，叫我们坐船往意大利去，便将保罗和别的囚犯交给御营里的一个百夫长，名叫犹流。第一节中的我们包括哪些人？百夫长是什么意思？

2有一只亚大米田的船，要沿着亚细亚一带地方的海边走，我们就上了那船开行；这艘船的目的地是哪里？有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人亚里达古和我们同去。还有谁和保罗与路加一起同行？

3第二天，到了西顿；犹流宽待保罗，准他往朋友那里去，受他们的照应。保罗得到什么准许？为什么？保罗从犹流那里得到了什么？

4从那里又开船，因为风不顺，就贴着塞浦路斯背风岸行去。你认为他们为什么不直接通过大海从西顿到每拉？

5过了基利家、旁非利亚前面的海，就到了吕家的每拉。6在那里，百夫长遇见一只亚历山大的船，要往意大利去，便叫我们上了那船。百夫长做了什么安排？

7一连多日，船行得慢，仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻，就贴着克里特背风岸，从撒摩尼对面行过。风对他们造成了什么困难？

8我们沿岸行走，仅仅来到一个地方，名叫佳澳；离那里不远，有拉西亚城。根据7节和8节我们对这艘船有哪些了解？他们的航行计划是穿过希腊海岛到达克里特北部。但从北风使航程改为经过撒摩尼到达佳澳。

9走的日子多了，已经过了禁食的节期，行船又危险，为什么变得危险了？保罗就劝众人说：

10「众位，我看这次行船，不但货物和船要受损伤，大遭破坏，连我们的性命也难保。」保罗的警告是什么？

11但百夫长信从掌船的和船主，不信从保罗所说的。百夫长信从了谁的话语？你认为他为什么不听保罗的话？

12且因在这海口过冬不便，船上的人就多半说，不如开船离开这地方，或者能到菲尼基过冬。他们为什么决定不在佳澳过冬？菲尼基是克里特的一个海口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。请你查看菲尼基的地点在哪里？

###### Notes: 注释：

Imperial Regiment - These soldiers were on what we would call "detached duty". They were not attached to a Roman garrison at one place or another, and they were not part of a Roman army engaged in a war. They move performed special police duties.

御营 - 这些士兵在执行我们今天称为“临时任务”的事物。他们不隶属于罗马在各地的防区，他们也不属于罗马的作战部队。他们经行各地承担特别的警察职责。

Lee - the side that the wind touches last as it crosses the boat, the downwind side of the boat.

背风岸 - 船体的受风之处，船的顺风面。

Alexandrian ship - A ship from Egypt that was loaded with grain. The Roman Empire depended on Egyptian grain. Such grain ships were under state control or Julius, as a Roman official, when it came to decisions relating to the movement of the ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

亚历山大的船 - 由埃及而来的船，装载着粮食。罗马帝国依赖埃及的粮食。这种运粮船属于国有或罗马长官犹流所有。因为它的航向而决定乘这艘船。

Day of Atonement - Usually falls in the latter part of September or in October. Jews traditionally observe this holy day with a 25-hour period of fasting and intensive prayer, seeking forgiveness for wrongs done against God  and against other human beings. At the end of Yom Kippur, one considers oneself absolved by God.

赎罪日 - 通常是在九月末或十月。传统上，犹太人以25小时的禁食和大量的祈祷来守这个日子，寻求对抵挡神的恶行或干犯了其他人的赦免。在赎罪日结束的时候，人被神所赦免。

The dangerous time for sailing was between the middle of September and the early part of November. Between November 11 and March 10, navigation stopped entirely.

对于航海来说危险的时期是在九月中旬和十一月的早期。在十一月11日和三月10日之间，航行是完全停止的。

###### The Storm  海上的风暴

13 When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. What were the weather conditions when they left Fair Havens? 

14 Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down from the island. What is another name for a Northeaster or hurricane? 

15 The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along. Why couldn't the ship head into the wind? 

16 As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure, Why would they have to make the lifeboat secure? 

17 so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Now what had to be done to secure the ship? Because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along. What else was done to keep the ship from drifting southwest? 

18 We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. What had not stopped? What was done? Why? 

19 On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. What was next thrown overboard? 

20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved. Why had they given up hope?

21 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. What does Paul remind the men on the ship? Why? 

22 But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. Why should they listen to Paul? 

23 Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me 

24 and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; Who was Paul to stand before? and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’ What else had the angel told Paul? 

25 So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. What did Paul confess? 

26 Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.” What must happen to the ship?

13这时，微微起了南风，他们以为得意，就起了锚，贴近克里特行去。当他们离开佳澳的时候天气怎样？

14不多几时，狂风从岛上扑下来；那风名叫「友拉革罗」。友拉革罗或狂风还被成为什么？

15船被风抓住，敌不住风，我们就任风刮去。船为什么不能迎风前行？

16贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行，那岛名叫高大，在那里仅仅收住了小船。他们为什么要把小船收住？

17既然把小船拉上来，就用缆索捆绑船底，他们还做了什么事来保护船？又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅，就落下篷来，任船飘去。他们还做了什么来避免船向西南漂流？

18我们被风浪逼得甚急，第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。什么事没有止息？人们还做了什么事？为什么？

19到第三天，他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。他们还抛弃了什么？

20太阳和星辰多日不显露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了。他们为什么没有指望了？

21众人多日没有吃什么，保罗就出来站在他们中间，说：「众位，你们本该听我的话，不离开克里特，免得遭这样的伤损破坏。保罗提醒船上的人什么事？为什么？

22现在我还劝你们放心，你们的性命一个也不失丧，惟独失丧这船。他们为什么应该听从保罗？

23因我所属所事奉的　神，他的使者昨夜站在我旁边，说：

24『保罗，不要害怕，你必定站在凯撒面前，保罗曾站在谁的面前？并且与你同船的人，　神都赐给你了。』神的使者还对保罗说了什么？

25所以众位可以放心，我信　神他怎样对我说，事情也要怎样成就。保罗宣信了什么？

26只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。」船必定要怎样？

###### Notes: 注释：

Cauda - About 37 kilometers (23 miles) from Crete. This provided enough shelter to make preparation against the storm.

高大 - 大约离克里特有37公里（23英里）。这里有足够的空间可以预备抵挡暴风。

Make the lifeboat secure - A small boat was being towed behind the ship. This boat was interfering with the progress of the ship and with the steering. It may also have been in danger of being crushed against the ship in the wind and the waves. It had to be taken aboard.

收住小船 - 小船被拖在大船后面。这小船妨碍了船的航行和操舵。它还可能因为风和浪而撞碎大船。因此必须把它收起来。

Passed ropes under the ship -  Probably crosswise to keep the planks of the hull from springing apart.

绳索捆绑船底 - 可能交叉的穿过木板从而避免它们裂开。

Sandbars of Syrtis - A long stretch of sandbars along northern Africa, still far away, but in such a storm the ship could be driven there. The sandbars were constantly being shifted by the winds and currents.

赛耳底沙滩 - 沿着北非的延绵的沙洲。还离得很远，但在这样的风暴中船有可能被带到那里去。沙洲因为风水流的不断作用而形成。

Ship’s tackle - This would be the equipment not essential for navigating the ship as the yardarm (the arm on a mast from which sails are set) or planks for ship repairs.

船上的器具 - 这些可能是无关于航行的装备，比如桅横杆端（水手在桅杆上安装的杆）或是维修船的木板。

###### The Shipwreck 船搁了浅

27 On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. For how long were they battling the storm? 

28 They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet(37 meters) deep. What did the sailors find? A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet(27 meters) deep. What did the sailors find? 

29 Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. How many anchors did they drop?  Why would they pray for daylight? 

30 In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. What did some sailors attempt? 

31 Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.” What warning did Paul give the centurion? 

32 So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away. What did the soldiers believe?

33 Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. What had not yet been thrown overboard? “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything. 

34 Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Why did Paul want the men to eat? Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.” What did Paul assure all that were on board? 

35 After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. To whom did Paul give thanks? 

36 They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. 37 Altogether there were 276 of us on board. How many were on board? 

38 When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. What additional action was taken?

39 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. What is the plan? 

40 Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 41 But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. Now what happened to the ship? The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. What next happened to the ship?

42 The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. What would happen to the soldiers if the prisoners escaped? 

43 But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. What is Julius (the centurion) risking with his kindness to Paul? 

44 The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely. What came true?

27到了第十四天夜间，船在亚得里亚海飘来飘去。约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地，他们在暴风中待了多久？

28就探深浅，探得有十二丈（37米）；水手有什么发现？稍往前行，又探深浅，探得有九丈（27米）。水手有什么发现？

29恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，盼望天亮。他们放下了几个锚？他们为什么要盼望天亮？

30水手想要逃出船去，把小船放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。有些水手想要做什么？

31保罗对百夫长和兵丁说：「这些人若不等在船上，你们必不能得救。」保罗向百夫长警告了什么？

32于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子，由它飘去。士兵们相信什么？

33 天渐亮的时候，保罗劝众人都吃饭，还有什么是没被扔掉的？说：「你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，已经十四天了。

34所以我劝你们吃饭，这是关乎你们救命的事；保罗为什么要让人吃饭？因为你们各人连一根头发也不至于损坏。」保罗向所有船上的人确保什么事？

35保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前祝谢了　神，擘开吃。保罗向谁祝谢？

36于是他们都放下心，也就吃了。37我们在船上的共有二百七十六个人。船上有多少人？

38他们吃饱了，就把船上的麦子抛在海里，为要叫船轻一点。他们还采取了什么行动？

39到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，但见一个海湾，有岸可登，就商议能把船拢进去不能。他们的计划是什么？

40于是砍断缆索，弃锚在海里；同时也松开舵绳，拉起头篷，顺着风向岸行去。41但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅；现在船怎样了？船头胶住不动，船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。船又怎样了？

42兵丁的意思要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有洑水脱逃的。如果囚犯逃脱了士兵则面临着什么？

44其余的人可以用板子或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样，众人都得了救，上了岸。什么事应验了？
