###### Strategies for continuing nurture 继续培养策略

Our spiritual commitment to our grace friends extends beyond finding opportunities to talk with them about God’s grace in Jesus.  We have sought to build a relationship with them, a relationship that will last as long as we live, even if those grace friends refuse to come to faith in Jesus. 
我们向恩典朋友的投入不能停留在找机会与他们谈论神在耶稣里的恩典，还要继续向外延伸。我们已经设法与他们建立了关系，即使那些恩典朋友拒绝相信耶稣，我们仍然需要保持这种关系，甚至让它持续一生。

As long as our grace friends are not believers, we will seek to influence them for the gospel.  That will include:

尽管我们的恩典朋友不是信徒，我们还要设法影响他们向福音迈进，那就要包括：

- Talking about the value we have found in Jesus.

- 谈论我们在耶稣里找到的价值

- Engaging them in conversations about their spiritual beliefs.

- 让他们参与属灵信仰的谈话

- Inviting them to worship.

- 邀请他们参加崇拜

- Going with them to Bible studies at your church, especially Bible information classes.

- 和他们一起参加你所在教会的查经学习，尤其是圣经信息课程的学习。

- Inviting them to your church for fellowship activities.

- 邀请他们到你的教会参加团契活动

- Praying for them.

- 为他们祷告

- Introducing them to other Christians, especially Christians who share their interests.

- 把他们介绍给其他基督徒，尤其是和他们有相同兴趣的基督徒

- Giving them books, tracts, and other gifts that refer to God’s grace; then engaging them in conversation about those gifts.

- 给他们赠送有关神恩典的书籍、小册子和其它礼物，然后与他们谈论那些礼物。

- Demonstrating Christ-like love and commitment to them.

- 向他们表现基督的爱以及你愿意为他们付出的心意。

After our grace friends become Christians they will need Christian mentors to help them grow through spiritual infancy. Although other Christians can help with this, you will probably be best positioned to be that mentor.  There are a number of spiritual disciples you will want to model for them. How might you help a new believer grow in the following areas of his/her faith life?

在我们的恩典朋友成为基督徒以后，他们将需要基督徒导师来帮助他们从属灵的婴孩长大成人。尽管其他基督徒可以提供帮助，但你可能正处于能够作他导师的最佳位置。有很多灵里的学徒都需要你给他们做榜样。你可以怎样帮助一个新信徒在他/她跟随耶稣走信心生活的道路上来帮助他/她呢？

- Personal Bible study 个人学习圣经

- Corporate Bible study 共同学习圣经

- Frequent worship and communing 常常崇拜并领圣餐

- Prayer 祷告

- Stewardship 服务

- Acts of Christian love 基督徒的爱心行动

###### Training others to share Jesus 培训他人分享耶稣

You are now ready to train other Christians to develop grace relationships with their grace friends so that the gospel might reach more souls. The Friends Share materials are your tools.  Here’s what you will do:

现在你已经做好准备培训其他基督徒与他们的恩典朋友建立关系，使福音能够临到更多的灵魂。朋友分享材料就是你的工具。下面是你需要做的事情：

- Pray for the Spirit’s blessings on our plans to lead this course.  You already know that it is his will that you and other Christians improve their witnessing skills. What you need is his help in finding the people he has prepared to be part of your course and in finding a time and place to conduct this study.

- 祷告求圣灵祝福我们的计划，并带领这个课程。你已经知道，圣灵的心意就是要让你和其他基督徒都能提高你们的见证技巧。你需要他的帮助来找到他已经预备要来参加课程学习的成员，并找到时间和地点来实施这个学习。

- Obtain a copy of the leader’s materials for Friends Share. Learn more about leading this study by carefully reading it.

- 拿一份为领袖准备的朋友分享材料，仔细阅读，更多学习如何带领这个课程。

- Invite one or two Christians to become part of your class.  (Before you invite anyone, pray about the people you will invite).  Emphasize that to your students that they are committing to 10 weeks of studying and practicing evangelism skills. There will be exercises they must complete each week. But at the end of the course, they will have improved their witnessing skills and will be able to teach others. Inform them that their daily prayers for this course begin now, even before the first class. Agree on a time and place to meet. Share the course materials with them.

- 邀请一两个基督徒来参加你的课程。（在你邀请其他人之前，为你准备邀请的人来祷告）。向你的学生强调，他们要投入10周的时间来学习并练习传福音的技巧，而且他们每周都要完成课后作业。但在课程结束时，他们的见证技巧会提高，而且能够教导他人。通知他们为这个课程做的每日祷告从现在就要开始，甚至在第一课开始之前就要开始。约定好一起学习的时间和地点，与他们分享这一课程。

- Continue to be the example of a Christian who loves their grace friends, is building a relationship with them, and is seeking to share Jesus with as many as possible. 

- 继续展示基督徒的榜样，爱他们的恩典朋友，与他们建立关系，努力与更多的人分享耶稣。

- If you need advice about teaching this course, please contact the instructor who taught you this material.

- 如果你需要这个课程的教学建议，请联系给你教导这些材料的导师。
