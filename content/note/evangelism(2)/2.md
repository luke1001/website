###### Learn to tell your grace story (personal testimony) 学习讲述你的恩典故事（个人见证）

“Have you heard about the grocery store on the corner?”

“你听说转角处的食品店了吗？”

“I’ve got to tell you what happened to me yesterday.”

“听我说说我昨天遇到的事情吧！”

“You won’t believe what Martha told me.”

“你很难相信玛莎对我说过的话。”

Stories.  We tell them and we listen to them every day.  They also work as vehicles to carry the gospel into the hearts of others.

我们每天都给人讲故事，也每天都听故事。听故事的人也像一个传播工具，把福音传到他人的心里。

Simple stories convey truths and make those truths more memorable than hours of lecture about philosophical principles. Think of the amount of time Jesus spent telling stories. When Christians tell stories about their relationship with Jesus, those stories also have the capacity to capture attention, teach Scripture truths, and remain in the memory of those who hear them.  We are about to learn how we can best communicate our faith stories so others can discover God’s grace in Jesus.

故事简单，却包含真理。简单的故事要比几小时的哲学理论讲座更让人记忆深刻。想想耶稣讲故事时花了多长时间。基督徒讲述自己和耶稣之间关系的故事，并用那些故事抓住人的注意力，然后给他们教导圣经的内容，你讲的内容就可以长久地留在听者的记忆中。接下来我们就要学习怎样最有效地与人交流我们的信仰故事，使人能在耶稣里发现神的恩典。

Telling our grace stories about how we came to rejoice in God’s grace is an easy, powerful way to witness to our trust in the gospel. Let’s talk about how to organize those stories.

我们怎样在神的恩典中进入欢喜快乐？把这个恩典故事讲出来，就是一个简单而有力的见证福音的方法。下面我们就来谈谈如何组织那些故事。

###### Key questions upon which to build your grace story. 组织恩典故事的主要问题

If you became Christian later in life:

如果你成为基督徒的时间比较晚：

- What was your life like before you became a Christian?  What did you value?  What did you think?  How was your lifestyle hurting you rather than helping?

- 你成为基督徒以前的生活是什么样子？你那时看重什么？你想的是什么？你的生活方式在怎样伤害你而不是帮助你？

- How did God come into your life?  Did you immediately welcome him, fight against him, keep him at a distance?  What did you find was the hardest thing to accept, to give up, to believe?

- 神怎样进入你的生活？你是立刻就邀请神，还是在与他争斗，与他保持距离？你那时觉得最难接受、最难放弃或最难相信的事情是什么？

- Why do you treasure knowing that God sent his Son to forgive all your sins, adopt you, and give you a place in his eternal heaven?

- 神差他的儿子到世上来，赦免你一切的罪；接纳你，为你在他永恒的国度预备地方。你知道这些以后为什么觉得特别宝贵？

- How is your life different now that you know how much God loves you?

- 知道神有多爱你之后，你的生命有了怎样的改变？

- What other benefits have you experienced from God’s grace?

- 你从神的恩典中还经历了哪些好处？

If you have been a Christian since you were young: 

如果你从小就是基督徒：

- Have you ever wandered from faith in Jesus?  Doubted his love for you?  What was that time in your life like?  What did you value?  What did you think?  How was your lifestyle hurting you rather than helping?

- 你曾离开过耶稣基督的信仰吗？你怀疑过他对你的爱吗？你的生活在那段时间过得怎么样？你看重的是什么？你想的是什么？你的生活方式在怎样伤害你而不是帮助你？

- How did God bring you to welcome him back into your life?  Did you immediately welcome him, fight against him, keep him at a distance?  What did you find was the hardest thing to accept, to give up, to believe? 

- 神怎样带领你让你重新欢迎他回到你的生命中？你是立刻就邀请神，还是在与他斗争，与他保持距离？你那时感觉最难接受、最难放弃或最难相信的事情是什么？

- Why do you treasure knowing that God sent his Son to forgive all your sins, adopt you, and give you a place in his eternal heaven?
神差他的儿子到世上来，赦免你一切的罪；接纳你，为你在他永恒的国度预备地方。你知道这些之后为什么感觉很宝贵？

- How is your life different now that you know how much God loves you?  How does that help you with the things you used to find hard to accept, to give up, to believe?

- 知道神多么爱你之后，你的生命发生了怎样的改变？它是怎样帮助你处理你以前觉得难接受、难放弃、难相信的事情？

- How did knowing God’s grace have an impact on your life when you were hurt or faced failing health?  When you needed help?  When you had a problem? When you experienced a special joy and blessing?  When you searched for the purpose of life? 

- 当你感到受伤或面临健康状况不佳时，知道神的恩典对你的生活有怎样的影响？当你遇到问题时？当你经历特别的快乐和祝福时？当你寻求生命的目的时又是怎样的呢？

- What other benefits have you experienced from God’s grace?

- 你从神的恩典中还经历到哪些好处？

Using your answers to these questions, write out your story.  Write it in a way that one of your grace friends would enjoy hearing.  When you write your story, include these suggestions:

使用你对这些问题的回答来组织你的故事。你可以用你的某个恩典朋友喜欢听的方式来写。故事内容要包含以下几个方面：

- **Theme**.  Every story needs a theme, a central issue.  When we share our faith with others the main theme must be about our sin and God’s grace that has forgiven those sins.

- **主题**. 每个故事都要有一个主题，也就是它的中心问题。当我们与他人分享我们的信仰时，我们的故事必须以我们的罪和神赦免那些罪的恩典为主题。

- **Beginning/middle/end**.  Every story must have a beginning, middle, and end.  The beginning introduces the situation.  The middle presents the problem that needs to be solved.  The end shows the solution.  In our faith stories we begin by talking about a time in our lives when we were attempting to live without God.  In the middle of those stories we talk about the painful result of not having a relationship with God.  At the end of our faith story we talk about how God’s grace in Jesus has transformed our lives and our eternities.

- **开始/中间/结尾**. 每个故事都必须有一个开始、中间和结尾。开始部分介绍情况，中间呈现需要解决的问题，结尾给出解决办法。在我们的信仰故事中，我们从谈论自己生活中的某个时间段开始。那时，我们是怎样试图过一个没有神的生活，然后在中间部分谈论没有与神建立关系而造成的痛苦结果。在结尾部分中，我们谈论神在基督里的恩典怎样改变了我们的生命和永恒的归宿。

- **Simplicity**.  Our stories should not take long to tell.  We will want to use simple words and easy to understand sentences.  We will want to design our stories so they are as clear as possible.

- **简洁**. 我们的故事不应该太长。我们需要使用简单词汇和容易懂的句子来讲，需要把故事设计得尽可能清晰易懂。

- **Scripture**.  Short references to Bible passages are good, but remember the people you tell your story to are not Christians.  They don’t respect the Bible, yet.  An over-use of Scripture may mean your friend will stop listening. 

- **圣经**. 简短地引用圣经的话是好方法，但要记得你的听众不是基督徒，他们还没有建立起对圣经的尊重。过多使用圣经的话可能会让你的朋友不想再听下去。

- **Language**.  Because the terms mean a lot to Christians, they tend to use religious words to talk about their faith.  Non-Christians don’t understand these terms.  Avoid religious clichés and jargon.  Speak in language your friend understands.

- **语言**. 圣经词汇对基督徒有特别意义，他们在谈论自己的信仰时会常常使用宗教词汇；而非基督徒对这些词语并不理解，所以要避免使用口头禅和术语。要用你的朋友能理解的词语来跟他们说话。

- **Put others first**.  Remember you are telling your story to benefit your friend.  Emphasize those aspects of your story that will relate to his or her concerns and interests.

- **把他人放在前面**. 要记得你的初衷。你给朋友讲故事的目的是要让他得益处，所以在你的故事中，要把他所关心且感兴趣的部分强调出来。

- **Conclusion**.  End your story with a question that requires a response. (What do you think about what I’ve shared with you? How would you like God to help in your life?)  Avoid questions that can be answered with a yes or no.  Rather ask questions that encourage your friend to reflect on your story and will allow you to respond to him/her. This question can also become a conversation starter at a later date.  For instance, on another day you might say, “Do you remember when I asked you, ‘How would you like God to help you’? Have you thought any more about that?”

- **结论**：用一个需要作出回应的问题来作结束（如：你怎么看待我分享的内容？你希望神怎样帮助你的生活？）避免使用可以用“是”或“不是”来回答的问题，而要让你的问题能鼓励他回想你的故事，需要你再来作答，并让这个问题成为一个日后可以引起话题的问题。比如，在以后的某一天你可以说：“你还记得吗？那天我问你‘你希望神怎样帮助你的生活？’你有没有更多的想法？”

###### Addendum  附件
###### A personal testimony 一篇个人见证

I have been a Christian for as long as I remember. My parents were Christians and my grandparents were Christians.  But when I was a young adult I lost interest in anything spiritual. All that was important to me was enjoying life – in all the wrong ways.  I drank too much alcohol. I experimented with drugs. I was attracted to the least moral women I could find.

从我记事起，我就是一个基督徒。我的父母是基督徒，我父母的父母也是基督徒。但当我进入青年时期以后，我对任何属灵的事都失去兴趣。唯一让我感兴趣的事就是享受生活——以所有错误的方式：我喝了太多的酒，尝试过毒品；我被自己能找到的最不道德的女人吸引。

But I found out that not one of that brought me real enjoyment. I lost jobs. My “friends” took advantage of me. My girlfriends were not friends at all; they used me to buy them the things they wanted and then moved on to others who had more money. Because of the way I was living I constantly worried about my health and my finances.

但我发现，那些事情没有一件能给我带来真正的享受。我丢了工作；我的“朋友”利用我；我的女朋友根本不是朋友；她们利用我给她们购买自己想要的东西，然后去找更有钱的人。我的生活方式让我开始为自己的健康和经济担忧。

Finally, one day I came to my senses. Every penny I had was gone. I was living on the street. I looked like a bum. I remember an old woman walking by me as I sat next to a building.  She spat on me.

最后有一天，我清醒过来。我身无分文，流落街头，看起来像个流浪汉。我记得一个老妇人从我身边走过时，她朝我吐了一口吐沫。

I remember starting to cry. I called out, “God, please help me.  Help me find the way back to when you were important in my life.” But then I thought, “Why would God do that for you? You’ve turned your back on him. He doesn’t want anything to do with you.”

我记得我开始哭泣。我喊着说：“神啊，请帮助我！帮我找回你对我仍然重要的那种生活方式。”但之后我又想：“神为什么要为你做那件事呢？你已经离弃了他，他不想和你有任何关系。”

Right then there was a Bible passage that came to my mind. I learned it as a child. “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”  I thought, “If God loved the world so much that his Son came to be its Savior, he still loves me. I’m part of the world. Jesus came to forgive me, even after all the ways I’ve sinned against him.”

正在那时，一句圣经经文浮现在我的脑海，那是我儿童时期背下来的：“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”我想，“如果神如此爱世人，甚至让他的儿子来作他们的救主，那他就仍然爱我，因为我也是世界的一份子。耶稣来赦免我的罪，即使在我犯了这一切的罪得罪了他之后，他仍然爱我。”

So I picked myself up and I walked until I found a church. I pounded on the door. It took a while for someone to let me in. It was Brother Yu. I told him my story, how ashamed I was, how much I wanted to know that God still loved me.

于是，我打起精神，开始寻找教堂，直到最终找到。我使劲敲门。过了一会儿，有人开门让我进去。后来知道他是于弟兄。我给他讲了我的故事，满心羞愧，迫切想知道神是否仍然爱我。

Brother Yu said, “Let’s talk. But first, let me give you some food.” Then, as I ate, he reminded me of Bible promises I learned as a child. He pointed me to God’s grace in Jesus and showed me from the Bible that God was welcoming me back into his arms. “It has to be that way,” he told me. “God’s Son suffered your punishment when he died on the cross. God is not angry with you. You are forgiven.”

于弟兄说：“我们谈谈吧！不过首先让我给你弄些吃的。”然后，我一边吃东西，一边听他讲圣经的应许，我像孩子一样仔细听着。他让我看神在耶稣里的恩典，又用圣经的话让我知道，神在欢迎我回到他的怀抱。他说：“真是那样。神的儿子在十字架上受死时，替你承担了你该受的一切刑罚，所以神今天不再对你怀怒，你被赦免了。”

From that time I recommitted myself to living to thank God.

从那以后，我决意为神而活，向他感恩。
