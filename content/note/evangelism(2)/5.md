“I’d love to talk to my grace friend about Jesus. I just don’t know how to begin the conversation. I can talk with him about the weather, our jobs, our children.  But somehow talking about Jesus seems impossible.”

“我很想和我的恩典朋友谈论耶稣，但就是不知道该怎么开始？我可以和他谈论天气、工作、孩子，但跟他谈耶稣似乎是不可能的。”

Is this your experience? If a Christian brother or sister would say this to you, what would you tell him/her?

这是你的经历吗？如果一个基督徒的弟兄或姐妹对你说起这些话，你会对他或她说什么呢？

Many Christians are challenged to begin conversations about spiritual issues with their grace friends.  They find it easy to talk sports, weather, and family.  But turning a conversation to their relationship with Jesus can come hard.

很多基督徒都觉得很难和他们的恩典朋友开始谈论属灵的话题。他们发现，把谈话转到与耶稣的关系上很难，但谈论运动、天气或家庭要容易得多。

Often Christians are fearful about starting these conversations because they want to avoid an argument or a fracture in their relationship with a friend.  Please remember that witnessing is the opposite of arguing.  Witnessing is not about winning a debate.  It is simply sharing information.  The person you witness to has the freedom to use that information as he pleases.

基督徒时常对与人谈论属灵话题有种惧怕感，因为他们想避免与朋友发生争论，害怕让他们之间的关系出现裂痕。请记住，做见证不是要和人争论，也不是要赢一场辩论，它只是在分享信息。听你见证的人有自由按他喜欢的方式回应你的信息。

An essential ingredient to any conversation about the gospel is prayer.  Ask the Spirit to open doors to talk about Jesus and to give you the courage to step through those doors.  Ask him to increase your joy over God’s love for you so you find you must tell others about him.  Ask the Spirit to work on the heart of your grace friend.

与人谈论福音话题的关键环节是祷告。求圣灵开门让你能谈论耶稣，给你勇气迈过那些门槛；让他在神对你的爱之上再加添你的喜乐，使你发现你必须要与人谈论耶稣；求圣灵在你的恩典朋友的心中做工。

###### Conversation turning events 转变话题的机会

Chances are something that appears on the front page of our local newspaper today is a topic you can easily talk with your grace friend about.  Or it may be the latest episode of a popular television program or a movie.  Or it may be a recent cartoon or a joke.

当地报纸的今日头条可以是一个你和恩典朋友很容易谈论的话题。最近热播的电影或电视节目，最新的卡通片，或者一个笑话都可以很容易谈论。

You can use any of these topics as a doorway to talk about how having Jesus as your Savior gives you a different perspective than most.  Just don’t forget to talk about how God’s grace, not his law informs your opinion.  For example

你可以使用上面提到的任何话题作引子来开始你们的谈话，你可以说，因为有耶稣做你的救主，让你与多数人有着不同的看问题的视角。只是不要忘了，要提到是神的恩典让你才有这样的看法，而不是他的律法。比如：

- When I read that headline about _____, I couldn’t help but thank God for being in control and directing world affairs in a wise and loving way. When I think about how God’s Son died to forgive all my sins, I have to believe he always has the world’s best interests at heart.

- 读到_______ 的头条时，我忍不住要感谢神，因为他在以智慧和慈爱的方式掌控并指引着世界的局势。当我想到神的爱子死在十字架上赦免我一切的罪，我就必须要相信，他心里永远都在为世人能够得到最大的益处而着想。

- Did you read that cartoon today?  It was so funny.  That cartoonist knows something about human nature and the way we get along with each other.  I thought, though, isn’t it sad that we can act like that toward each other?  That’s another reason I’m glad to have Jesus in my life. His love for me helps me to have different values.

- 你看到今天那副漫画了吗？那副漫画揭露了人的本性以及人的相处之道。我在想，人竟然能那样残忍地对待他人，真是令人悲哀。这也是为什么我要让耶稣住在我生命中的原因，他对我的爱让我拥有不同的价值观。


###### Conversation turning materials 转换对话的材料

- An easy way to begin a conversation about spiritual matters is to give your friend material to read or a video to watch that has a hopeful, Scripture-based message. Before giving this spiritual material, express how it has helped you and that you thought your friend might enjoy it as well.  Suggest a time when you might talk about it together.  

- 把对话转向属灵话题的简易方法之一是给你的朋友提供一个给人带来盼望，又以圣经为根据的阅读材料或视频看。在递给对方这个阅读材料之前，先说一下它是怎样帮助你的。你猜想你的朋友或许也喜欢看，然后预定一个你们可以一起谈论的时间。

When you meet again, several natural conversation starters would be:

当你们再次见面时，可以很自然地谈到以下几个话题：

- What did you think of that book (brochure, video, etc.)?  Here’s what I thought about it.

- 你觉得那本书（小册子，视频等）怎么样？我的看法是这样的：

- What did you think about the way God was portrayed?

- 你怎么看待里面对神形象的描述？

- I thought you might especially like the part about ____.  Was that helpful for you?  Do you have any questions?

- 我想你会特别喜欢有关_______ 的部分。它对你有帮助吗？你有什么问题没有？

- I went through a similar time a few years ago when ____.  Knowing that God sent his Son to be my Savior was a real benefit then because _____.

- 我几年前也有过类似的经历，那时__________。知道神差他的儿子来做我的救主，在那个时候带给我很大的帮助，因为_____________。

###### Conversation turning questions 转换话题的问题

There are a wide variety of questions that easily turn a conversation toward spiritual topics.  Here are several examples.

有各种各样的问题可以让你们的谈话转到属灵话题上来。下面就是几个例子。

- What is the most important thing you have learned about life?

- 你对生活的最大领悟是什么？

    o This question provides you with an opportunity to share the most important thing you have learned about life: God loves and forgives you in Jesus.

    o 这个问题让你有机会分享你对生活的最大领悟：神透过耶稣爱你，赦免你。

- What are you most proud of about your life?

- 生活中最让你感到自豪的事是什么？

    o This question allows you to acknowledge situation and accomplishments (career, education, family, etc.) while adding that you are most proud of knowing that Jesus has made you a loved child of God.
    
    o 这个问题让你对生活中的事情以及所取得的成就（事业、教育、家庭等方面）向神献上感恩，然后加入有关耶稣的部分——最让你自豪的事就是知道耶稣让你成了一个神所爱的孩子。

- If you could only do three things this year, what would they be?

- 如果你今年只能做三件事，那会是什么呢？

    o This question provides an opening for you to include in your list things like growing closer to Jesus, seeing your friend come to faith in Jesus, reading through the Bible, etc.  You will also want to explain how grace makes those items a priority for you.
    o 这个问题让你可以把自己列出来的内容包括进去，比如更加亲近耶稣，看见你的朋友能信耶稣，通读圣经等等。你也会想要解释一下神的恩典怎样使那些事情成为你生活中的首要选项。

- What is your greatest strength?

- 你最大的优点是什么？

    o This question offers an opportunity for you to talk about the strength, courage, assurance, and hope that come with having a right relationship with God and access to all of his promises.
    o 这个问题让你有机会谈论力量、勇气、确据和盼望，这些都是因为你和神之间有一个正确的关系，而且能够得到他应许的所有事情。

- What is the thing that motivates you the most? (A related question: What makes you the most happy?)

- 你的最大动力是什么？（相关问题可以是：最让你感到快乐的事情是什么？）

    o This question allows you to talk about things that motivate you (love of family, getting ahead financially, etc.) but also gives you the opportunity to talk about how God’s grace in Jesus energizes everything you do. 
    o 这个问题可以让你有机会谈论你的最大动力（家人的爱、让你的经济状况得到改善等），还让你有机会谈论神的恩典透过耶稣给你动力做一切事情。

- Who have been your mentors?

- 你的导师是谁？

    o This question opens the door to talking not only about key individuals in your personal and career life, but about spiritual mentors and how they helped you stay close to Jesus.
    
    o 这个问题为你开了一道门，让你不仅可以谈论你个人和事业生涯中的一些人，也让你能够谈论属灵的导师，以及他们怎样帮助你和耶稣保持亲近的关系。

- If you could ask God one question, what would you ask him?

- 如果你能问神一个问题，你会问他什么？

    o Give your answer first and then ask what question your friend would ask. Your friend’s answer may have to do with a way he thinks God has failed him.  You might respond, “I can understand how you could reach that conclusion.  I’ve realized, however, that the God who sent his Son to forgive my sins could never fail us.  I may not understand what he is doing, but he could never fail to keep his promises.” This would be an excellent starting point to talk about God’s love for sinful humans and the forgiveness he has given us.

    o 你可以先分享你自己的答案，然后再问你的朋友会问什么问题。你朋友的回答可能是他觉得神令他失望。你就可以说：“我能理解你得出如此结论的原因。不过，我在想，既然神让他的儿子赦免了我的罪，他就永远不可能让我们失望。虽然有时我并不能真正明白他在做什么，但他永远都不会违背他的承诺。”这可以是一个很棒的开始，让你能谈论神对罪人的爱以及他赐给我们的饶恕。

To start a conversation with a grace friend, listen, listen, listen. After asking questions like these, give your grace friend time to answer.  Listen intently to the answer she gives.  Then reflect back to her what you understood her to say.  For example, “So you feel ____” or “I’ve heard you say ____.  Please tell me more” or “I’m really interested. Why would you choose that option?”  After your friend has had an opportunity to talk about herself, it is socially expected that you talk about yourself.  Take advantage of this door to a conversation about your spiritual values.  

与一个恩典朋友开始对话时，要听，听，听。问完类似的问题后，给你的恩典朋友时间让他回答，要认真听他/她讲说他们的答案。然后再把你对他所说事情的理解反馈给他/她。比如：“所以你觉得______________。”或者“我听你说过____________。再给我说说吧！”或者“我很感兴趣，你为什么要那么选择呢？”在你的朋友有机会讲完自己的事情以后，按照社交的常理，他也会期待你谈谈自己。利用这个机会来说说你的属灵价值观。

###### Follow up to your conversation 跟进你的对话

Remember that we are in a long-term relationship with our grace friends.  Any conversations about spiritual matters that our questions begin will not be the last time we talk about those issues.  If your friend doesn’t respond in faith, that is fine.  Continue to look for future opportunities to share the gospel.  For instance, you might say, “I’ve been thinking about our last conversation.  You said, ‘____.’  Could you say more about that?”  Or “The last time we talked, I said, ‘____.’ What I really should have said was _____.”

要记住，我们和恩典朋友的关系是一个长期的关系。开启属灵话题的任何问题都不会是你最后一次谈论那些事情。如果你朋友的回应是不信，也没关系。继续找机会与他分享福音。比如，你可以说：“我一直在考虑我们上次的谈话，你说：‘________。’你能再说说吗？”或者“上次我们谈话的时候，我说：‘_________。’我实际上本来应该说__________。”

Our lessons have not yet presented approaches to talk about God’s grace in Jesus. That begins in the next unit.  So what should you say to your grace friend about Jesus?
