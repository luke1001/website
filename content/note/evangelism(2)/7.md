“I’ve got the basics of what to say about sin and grace,” you might feel at this point. “But my attempts to share Jesus are not going smoothly.  What more do I need to know?” Here are several items to think about.

“我掌握了怎么解释罪与恩典的基本内容，但我与人分享耶稣的尝试进展不顺利。我还需要知道些什么呢？”如果你有这样的问题，你就可以考虑以下几点内容。

- **Theme**: The most important issue you can discuss with your friend is how sin has destroyed our relationship with God and how God, because of his grace, has fixed that through Jesus. Do not allow yourself to be sidetracked by other issues (for example, when the world will end, the differences between religions/denominations, how the universe was created).  These other issues are important but a clear presentation of sin and grace are much more important.

- **主题**：你要与朋友讨论的最重要的问题是罪怎样破坏了我们与神之间的关系，以及神怎样因着他的恩典，透过耶稣修复了和他的关系。不要让自己被其它问题拉偏（比如，这个世界什么时候结束，不同宗教/教派之间有什么区别，宇宙是怎样被创造的等等）。这些其它的问题固然有其必要性，但能清楚地把罪与恩典讲解出来更要紧。

- **Message**: Your message needs to be simple, clear, and concise.  Keep it uncluttered with unnecessary thoughts that take focus away from our sin and God’s grace.  Your tools are God’s law and gospel.  

- **信息**：你的信息要简单、清楚而简明；要有条理，不凌乱。不要让不重要的想法让你失去重心，离开了我们的罪与神的恩典这个重心。你的工具是神的律法和福音。

    o Describe sin with specifics: “Becoming so angry that we intentionally say things to hurt others is a sin” is much better than, “People tend to do bad things.”  When you talk about sin point out how our attitudes, not just our actions, are displeasing to God.  Descriptions of sin should also include admitting to sin in your life rather than only highlighting sin in other people’s lives.  

    o 描述罪要具体：“我们在生气时无意中会说出伤害人的话，这就是罪”。这种具体的事例要比笼统地说“我们常常做坏事”更好。谈论罪时要指出，我们身上不讨神喜悦的东西不仅仅是我们的行为，还有我们的态度。对罪的描述也要包括在生活中承认自己的罪，而不只是指出别人生活中的罪。

    o The gospel, too, must be specific.  Talk about how Jesus’ hell-filled death on the cross has forgiven all sin for all people. But also emphasize how Jesus has forgiven all your friend’s sins – including whatever specific sins he/she may have discussed with you.  

    o 讲解福音也要具体。讲耶稣怎样在十字架上承受了地狱的死亡，以及他怎样赦免了所有人的所有罪恶，包括他可能已经与你讨论过的任何一个具体的罪。

- **Scripture**:  Using God’s Word is important when we share Jesus with others.  The power to bring souls to faith lies in the Bible’s gospel promises, not in us.  But the power of the gospel doesn’t just reside in Scripture quotes.  The Spirit also seeks to use parts of Bible passages we speak or our paraphrasing of Bible passages to call people to faith.  That’s especially important to remember if your friend seems to stop listening when you quote Bible verses. 

- **圣经**：当我们与人分享耶稣时，使用神的话很重要。能够带领人相信的能力来自圣经中的福音应许，而不是我们。当你引用圣经的话时，就有福音的能力发出来；在你说到或者用自己的话解释圣经的经文时，圣灵也会使用那些话来呼召人相信。在你的朋友似乎不想再听你引用经文时，你就可以用自己的话来解释经文，这也是非常重要的。

- **Language**: Have you ever tried to talk with an educator or engineer who could only use their professional jargon to explain what they do for a living?  You probably came away wondering what in the world that person was saying.  Christians need to avoid Bible jargon, “God talk.” Words like justification and atonement may mean a lot to us, but they are only unintelligible sounds to people outside Christianity. 

- **语言**： 你是否有过跟只会用专业术语解释自己工作的教育家或工程师说话的经历？你可能心里在想，那个人究竟在说什么呀！基督徒需要避免使用圣经术语—“神话”。如“称义”和“救赎”之类的词。这些词对我们可能意义深远，但对于非基督徒而言，那些只是莫名其妙的声音而已。

- **Important**: Explain that, even though you don’t want to coerce your friend into a relationship with Jesus, sharing this message is important to you –hence your desire to talk about it.  Friends share information that is important to them, but they don’t insist that their friends must also value that information as they do.

- **重要性**：尽管你不想强迫你的朋友与耶稣建立关系，也要向他解释，对你来说与他分享这个信息很重要，所以你很期待与他谈论这个话题。朋友之间分享的信息通常都是对他们来说较重要的内容，不过他们也不会坚持要他们的朋友必须像他们一样看重那些信息。

- **Keep it short**: Remember that sharing Jesus with our friends is not a one-time event.  We are in those friendships long-term.  Please spend time talking about Jesus if your friend really wants to discuss the gospel. But also understand there’s nothing wrong with weaving statements about the gospel into your conversations a couple minutes here and a couple minutes there.  Relax. Over time you’ll have plenty of opportunity to explain the entire message. 

- **尽量简短**：要记住，与我们的朋友分享耶稣不是一个一次性就了结的事，我们要和那些朋友建立长期的关系。如果你的朋友真想讨论福音，请花时间与他们谈论耶稣，但也要理解，能把福音的信息时不时地插入你们的谈话也没什么不对。不用着急，久而久之，你会有足够的机会把整个信息解释完整。

- **Expect Resistance**:  People who aren’t Christians will naturally resist trusting Jesus (remember they are dead in sin).  This is the only response they can manage.  They may want to argue with your message.  They may resent it.  They may become defensive.  Accept that. It is normal. Loving people through their resistance is part of sharing Jesus with them.  Keep looking for and praying for openings to talk about Jesus.  Continue to show Christ-like love for your friend.

- **要预料对抗**：非基督徒会拒绝相信耶稣，这也是自然的反应（记得他们是死在罪中的人）。这是他们能做出的唯一反应。他们可能会跟你辩论，可能会产生厌恶感，也可能开始产生防备心理。这些都很正常，接受它们吧！尽管他们会对抗，但你仍然选择去给他们讲福音，这是爱的表现，也是与人分享耶稣的一部分。继续寻找机会，继续祷告，让你能与人分享耶稣，也继续向你的朋友表达基督般的爱。

- **Put others first**: When you tell your “Jesus Story” the emphasis isn’t on your need to talk about Jesus.  It is about your friend’s need to hear about him.  Keep your focus on your friend.  Emphasize the aspects of your story that will relate to his or her concerns and interests.

- **将对方放在前面**：当你讲述“耶稣故事”时，重心不应该是你需要谈论耶稣，而是你的朋友需要听到耶稣。把重心放在你朋友的身上，强调你讲的故事中与他有关联或他所关心的部分，如他的兴趣等。

- **Rejoice**: Allow your friends to see that having Jesus as your Savior means that even in the worse of circumstances we have a foundation of joy, the expectation of good, and unflagging hope.  During the struggle times that come into your life, your joy in Jesus will be especially important to live out for your friend to see.

- **喜乐**：让你的朋友看见你有耶稣作你救主的意义——即使在糟糕的环境中，我们仍然有喜乐的理由，仍然有美好的期待和不摇动的盼望。当生活出现不如意时，让你的朋友看见你因为活在耶稣里而有的喜乐，这将尤其重要。

- **Conclusion**: Whenever you come to the end of one of your presentation of the gospel, ask your friend a question that requires a response. These questions will open the conversation to further discussion, clarification, and inquiry.  The best type of questions to ask would be open ended questions, questions that require more than a yes or no answer.  For example, you might ask: How does that fit with your view of God? What about this doesn’t make sense to you? How might trusting God’s grace help you right now?  

- **结论**：每次你讲完福音时，问你朋友一个需要回应的问题。这些问题将会推进你们的谈话，让谈论的内容具有探究性，也会更加清晰。最好的问题是那些开放式的问题，不是用是或不是就结束的问题，而是需要更多内容来回答。比如你可以问：这些与你以前对神的认识有什么不同？你是怎么理解这些的？相信神的恩典对你现在有什么帮助？
- **Pray**: James 5:16 promises, “The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.”  Every prayer you offer for someone who is not yet a Christian brings God’s gracious power to bear on that person’s soul. Keep this spiritual weapon in your arsenal as you engage in battle for your friend’s soul.

- **祷告**：雅各书5:16应许：“义人所发的祈祷大有功效。”你为一个不是基督徒的人做的祷告会让神恩典的能力降在那个人的心灵中。在你为你朋友的灵魂争战时，要把这个属灵武器装备到你的军械库中。
