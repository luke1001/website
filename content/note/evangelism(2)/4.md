“I’ve tried everything to let her know I love her. Flowers. Greetings cards. Spending time with her.  Nothing seems to work.”

“我想尽一切办法让她知道我爱她：鲜花、问候卡、花时间陪她等等，但什么方法都不管用。”

Perhaps the problem in failing to connect with some people in our lives has to do with language.  We speak a love language that is different than their love language.  So we don’t communicate our love.

或许语言是我们生活中和一些人失去联络的原因所在。我们所使用的表达与接受爱的方式（此处称为“爱的语言”）与他们的不一样，所以我们无法和他们沟通。

Personal evangelism is more than a five minute conversation with a stranger about the gospel.  Of course, it is true that sometimes all the Spirit provides us is a one-time, limited opportunity to share the story of God’s grace with others.  But most often the Spirit puts us into a relationship with the people he positions us to witness to.  That makes working to build that relationship an essential part of showing our faith to them and also sharing our faith with them. 


个人传福音不仅仅是与一个陌生人进行5分钟的福音对话。当然，圣灵有时候给我们提供的也的确仅有一次和他人分享神恩典故事的机会。不过，在一般情况下，圣灵会把我们放在一个能向他们做见证的人际关系中。这样一来，我们就需要与他们之间建立一种关系，使我们有机会向他们展示我们的信仰。

Understanding the love languages people “speak” helps us to build those relationships.

了解他们“说”的爱之语能帮助我们有效建立和他们之间的关系。

###### Love Languages 爱的语言

In The Five Languages of Love Gary Gary Chapman points out that humans express love in five distinct forms.  We show love to others using these forms (Chapman calls them languages) and we feel loved when others speak to us in our love language.

在爱的五种语言一书中，盖瑞-查普曼指出，人们用五种不同方式来表达爱。我们用这些方式向他人表达爱（查普曼称之为五种语言），而且当他人用这种语言对待我们时，我们也会感到被爱。    

The love languages are: 

这五种爱的语言分别是：

- Words of Affirmation: Actions don’t always speak louder than words. If this is your love language, unsolicited compliments mean the world to you. Hearing the words, “I love you,” are important—hearing the reasons behind that love sends your spirits skyward. Insults can leave you shattered and are not easily forgotten.

- 肯定的话语：行动并不总是比语言更响亮。如果这是你的爱语，那么主动提供的赞美对你的意义就是全世界。对他说“我爱你”非常重要，能再听到那份爱背后的原因会让你的心飞向天空。相反，辱骂的语言会造成破碎的后果，而且几乎永远难以忘却。

    o If your grace friend speaks this love language, he will value your empathy and your ability to see the world from his perspective. She will desire that you are a voice of encouragement in her life and that you point out her hidden potentials.  Words of encouragement include compliments, words that inspire, words of kindness, and words spoken in humility (for example, making requests rather than demands).
    
    o 如果你的恩典朋友讲的是这门语言，他就会看重你的感受，并能从他的角度来看你所看到的世界。她会渴望你成为她生活中一个鼓励的声音，指出她的内在潜力。鼓励的言辞包括赞美、激励的话、良善的话以及谦卑的话（如，提出建议，而不是要求和命令）。

- Quality Time:In the vernacular of Quality Time, nothing says, “I love you,” like full, undivided attention. Being there for this type of person is critical, but really being there—with the TV off, fork and knife down, and all chores and tasks on standby—makes your significant other feel truly special and loved. Distractions, postponed dates, or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful. 

- 优质时间：在优质时间这一项中，没有任何东西能像完全不分心的注意力那样完美地表达“我爱你”的含义。对于这种人来说，他们对陪伴在那里的时间是比较挑剔的，必须是真地在那里——关掉电视，放下刀叉，停止一切的琐事和工作。这才能使另一方感到真地特别与被爱。分心、推迟赴约或不用心听都会造成特别的伤害。

    o A key to speaking this love language is more than spending time with your friend.  It is providing this person with your focused attention. We show focused attention by maintaining eye contact, refraining from doing anything else during our conversations, and refusing to interrupt while your friend is talking.  People who speak this love language appreciate when their friends listen for the feelings they are expressing (for example, “It sounds like you are sad today”).  To love Quality Time friends it is important to pay attention to their body language: Are they tense, protective, open?  When speaking with these friends stay on the topic and be willing to share personal details about yourself.
    
    o 说这种爱语的关键不只在花时间和你的朋友在一起，而是把你的注意力聚中在这个人身上。通过保持眼神交流、谈话时尽量克制自己不去做任何其它事情，还要拒绝在你的朋友说话时打断她/他说话。如果你能听出他们表达的感受，说这种爱语的人会很感激（如，“你今天听起来不太开心”）。要去爱这种注重优质时间的朋友，就要留意他们的身体语言：他们是否感到紧张，有些自我保护，还是比较敞开？与这些朋友说话时，不能偏离话题，还要愿意分享你自己的个人细节。

- Receiving Gifts: Don’t mistake this love language for materialism; the receiver of gifts thrives on the love, thoughtfulness, and effort behind the gift. If you speak this language, the perfect gift or gesture shows that you are known, you are cared for, and you are prized above whatever was sacrificed to bring the gift to you. A missed birthday, anniversary, or a hasty, thoughtless gift would be disastrous—so would the absence of everyday gestures. 

- 接收礼物：不要把这种爱语误解成物欲主义；接收礼物的人喜悦的是礼物背后的爱、体贴和用心。如果你说的是这种语言，完美的礼物或类似的心意所表达的就是：你被了解，你被关心，而且你被宝贵，值得付出一切代价为你送礼物。一个错过了的生日，纪念日，或者一个匆忙随意的礼物将会带来毁灭性的后果——每天的日常表示如果缺失，也会有同样的后果。

    o The person who speaks this love language thrives on the love, thoughtfulness, and effort that are the foundations of gift giving. Gifts need not be expensive, but they do need to be meaningful. For these people gifts are a symbol of the love behind those gifts. Gifts to them require thought, planning, time, effort, and energy. Giving of your presence is a form of gift giving.  This is an especially treasured gift during times of celebration and crisis.

    o 说这种爱语的人喜悦送礼物背后的根基，就是爱、体贴和用心。礼物不需要贵重，但要有意义。对这些人来说，礼物象征着爱。给他们的礼物需要细心、计划、时间、努力和用心。你的陪伴也是一种形式的礼物。在特殊的庆祝和危机中，这是一种特别珍贵的礼物。

- Acts Of Service: Can vacuuming the floors really be an expression of love? Absolutely! Anything you do to ease the burden of responsibilities weighing on an “Acts of Service” person will speak volumes. The words he or she most want to hear: “Let me do that for you.” Laziness, broken commitments, and making more work for them tell speakers of this language their feelings don’t matter. 

- 服务行动：用吸尘器清洁地板能成为一种爱的表达吗？绝对是！你为一个讲“服务行动”语言的人减轻她身上的责任重担而做的任何事都会很有意义。他或她最想听的话便是：“让我来为你做。”懒惰、不遵守承诺，以及为他们制造更多的事情要他们做，都是在对说这种语言的人说：你不在乎你的感受。

    o At the heart of this type of love is a desire to serve others.  This love language lives by the saying, “Actions speak louder than words.” Speak this love language by training yourself to help others with a willingly spirit. Look for ways to relieve these friends of some of the responsibilities they carry. Help them know you are putting them before yourself.

    o 这种爱的核心是渴望服务他人。这种爱语的生活隽语是：“行为比语言更响亮。”人要通过训练自己带着乐意的心帮助他人的方式来学会说这种语言，寻找能帮助这些朋友释放他们所负责任的方式。帮助他们知道，你把他们看得比你自己更重要。Acts9：36

- Physical Touch:Demonstrate love to someone who speaks this love language with hugs, pats on the back, and thoughtful touches on the arm or the shoulder.  The speakers of this love language also place high value on your physical presence in their lives. Of course, to communicate well in this love language, you will have to check with your friend about the kind of touch they consider appropriate.  

- 身体接触：对说这种爱语的人表达爱，需要用到拥抱、拍背以及周到的碰胳膊或肩膀的方式。说这种爱语的说话者也看重你在他们生活中的亲身陪伴。当然，为了能更好地用这种爱语交流，你必须要与你的朋友交流，确认他们是否觉得那些是合适的方式。

    o Expressing love through physical touch can be challenging because some people will interpret forms of touching as an invasion of their personal space. Be sure to ask for clarification as to what your friend considers appropriate touch (“Can I hold your hand?  Is it OK if I touch your shoulder? Would you like a hug?”).  You can learn a lot about what a person who speaks this language considers appropriate by paying attention to the ways they touch others.

    o 通过身体接触表达爱的方式可能具有挑战性，因为有些人会把触摸方式看成你在侵犯他们的私人空间。一定要和你的朋友确认，哪些方式才是对方认为合适的做法（“我可以握你的手吗？可以碰你的肩膀吗？你想要一个拥抱吗？”）你可以通过观察说这种语言的人怎样对待他人的方式来了解他们认为合适的做法。

We err when we assume that other people experience love in the same way we do. We are mistaken to believe that the best way to express love to them is by speaking our love language rather than their love language. That is akin to speaking Chinese to an English speaker assuming that because we understand Chinese, they must also understand what we are saying. In those situations, our communication fails.

如果我们以为其他人感受爱的方式和我们的一样，那我们就错了。我们如果相信表达爱的最好方式就是说我们的爱语而不是他们的爱语，那我们就误会了。那就好比一个说中文的人在对着一个说英文的人说中文，因为他自己说中文，他就以为人人都懂中文，而且他们也一定明白我们在说的话。在这种情况下，我们的交流就失败了。

The principle of speaking the appropriate love language is important to remember in our relationship with close family and close friends.  It will also guide us as we seek to build a long-term relationship with our grace friends and to demonstrate God’s love to them.

要记住，在我们与亲近的家人和朋友的关系中，说合适的爱语很重要。它也会在我们寻求与恩典朋友建立关系，向他们表达神对他们的爱时，对我们起指导作用。

The key to identifying the love language of others is to observe the way they express love to others, to analyze what they complain about most often, and to notice what they request most often from those who are closest to them. Chapman says that people tend to naturally give love in the way that they prefer to receive love.  He suggests that people feel loved when we speak their love language as a way to fill up their “emotional love tank,” that is, their need to know that others care about them and value them.

分辨他人爱语的关键是观察他们向其他人表达爱的方式，分析他们最常抱怨的事情，留意他们向自己亲近的人最多的要求是什么。查普曼说，人们通常会自然地以他们喜欢接受爱的方式来给予爱。他建议，人会在我们说他们的爱语时感到被爱；他们会感到自己“爱的情绪箱”被填满，感到有人关心、有人珍惜他们。

In order to demonstrate God’s grace to your grace friend, you will want to learn their love language (most people speak one predominate love language and a secondary love language). You will want to communicate with them in those languages.  It will open doors for you to share the story of God’s universal language of love in Jesus.

为了向你的恩典朋友展示神的恩典，你会想要学习他们的爱语（多数人说着一种主要语言还有另一种次要语言）。你会想要用那些语言和他们交流。这会为你打开一扇门，让你能和他们分享神的故事，就是在耶稣里的普世爱语。

###### Characteristics of Christians who share their faith 分享信仰见证的基督徒特征

Whatever the love language your grace friends speak, you will seek to talk about your friend Jesus in a way that aligns with who you are. We shouldn’t transform into someone who is only playing the part of a Christian. Be yourself.  Let the following characteristics shine through you.  

无论你的恩典朋友说的是哪种语言，你都会希望以你本身固有的一种方式来和人讨论你的朋友——耶稣。我们不应该变成一个只有自己的一部分是基督徒的人。要做你自己。让以下这些特点能透过你发出亮光。


- **Authentic**: “Christians are to be good news before they share the good news” (Joseph Aldrich). When love is genuine people will sense it.  Let your light shine.

- **真实**：“基督徒在分享好消息之前，就要成为好消息”（约瑟夫-奥德里奇）。如果你的爱是真诚的，人们会感受到。要让你的光亮起来！

- **Natural**:  When our approach to sharing Jesus fits who we are, we are comfortable and the people we witness to realize our message is real to us and worth considering for themselves.  A message about God’s grace that sounds contrived or even too well polished will turn our friends off.

- **自然**：如果我们与人分享耶稣的方法与我们本人的身份一致，我们就会感到舒服。听我们见证的人也会感受到那些信息对我们的真实性，并且引导他们为自己去考虑。神的恩典信息如果让人听起来感觉做作，甚至有太多的修饰成分，会把我们的朋友撵走。

- **Personal**:   People don’t want to talk about spiritual matters with just anyone.  They want to talk with a friend.  Be that friend.

- **个人化**：人们不是想和任何一个人谈论属灵的事情，他们只想和一个朋友来谈论。你要去成为那个朋友。

- **Ordinary vocabulary**:   Talk about Jesus, using the words you’d say when describing a close friend to someone.  Other people recognize that there is something about us Christians that makes us different than others.  But they won’t know why we are different unless we explain how “Christ’s love compels us” (2 Corinthians 5:14).  No wonder the Bible says people need to be told the gospel: “How can they hear without someone preaching to them?” (Romans 10:14). 

- **普通词语**：你在谈论耶稣时，要使用你给人描述一个亲近朋友所使用的词语。我们只有在向别人解释了“是基督的爱激励我”（林后5:14）之后，他们才会看出我们基督徒与人不同的地方在哪里，否则别人不会发现我们的不同之处。难怪圣经上说人们需要先听到福音：“罗10:14 然而人未曾信他，怎能求他呢？未曾听见他，怎能信他呢？没有传道的，怎能听见呢？”

- **Long-term commitment**: Most do not come to faith in Jesus immediately after hearing the gospel for the first time.  Usually the Spirit works over time and through multiple witness opportunities.  Take a long term approach.

- **长期委身**：多数人都不会在第一次听到福音就立刻相信耶稣。通常圣灵会在较长的时间里透过很多见证机会来工作，所以要使用长时间策略。

- **Team-oriented**:   Some Christians sow the gospel’s seed, some water it, some harvest (1 Corinthians 3:5-9).  Rejoice in the role the Spirit gives you.  Invite other Christians to get to know your grace friend and to reinforce the gospel’s message.

- **有团队精神**：有的基督徒播撒福音的种子，有的人来浇灌，有的人来收割（林前3:5-9），要在圣灵给你的角色中欢喜。邀请其他基督徒了解你的恩典朋友，强化福音信息。

- **Other-focused**:   One of the most attractive features of the gospel is how the eternal God put us first.  We demonstrate our Father's love as we put others first.  We rearrange our schedules to suit theirs.  We take an active interest in their hobbies and interests.  We ask questions and listen intently to their answers.  We represent Jesus to them.  

- **关注对方**：福音最有吸引力的特点之一，就是永恒的神把我们放在前面。当我们把他人放在我们前面时，就是在彰显天父的爱。我们安排的时间要以方便他人为宗旨；我们要积极考虑他们的爱好和兴趣；要提问并认真聆听他们的回答。我们在他们面前就是耶稣的代表。

- **Gospel-centered**:   Stay focused on the main message: grace. We’re not sharing the good news of God’s grace when we bemoan the lack of integrity in leaders at work or when we wring our hands about the decline of morals among the young.  We’re not sharing the gospel when we point out the faults of other denominations or discuss how many people will go to heaven.  When the conversation with your grace friend turns to spiritual matters, talk about God’s grace. The focus of our message must be Jesus’ blood-stained cross and triumph-bannered tomb.

- **以福音为中心**：始终不能偏离中心信息：恩典。当我们悲叹在任领导缺乏公正，或者对年轻人的道德堕落感到难过时，我们并没有在传福音。当我们指出另一个宗派的错误时，或讨论有多少人将上天堂时，也不是在传福音。当与你的恩典朋友之间的谈话转向属灵话题时，要谈论神的恩典。我们的焦点信息必须是耶稣沾满鲜血的十字架以及他得胜的锦旗——空坟墓。
