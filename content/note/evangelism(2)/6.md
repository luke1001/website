The approach we use to witness can always be improved.  But there is no witness if we don’t say anything. So the best method for sharing Jesus with others is to use whatever words the Spirit gives you.

我们做见证的方法可以不断改进，但是如果我们什么都不说，就根本没有见证可言。所以，与人分享耶稣的最好方法是使用圣灵带领你说出的话。

Christians have developed many outlines to guide them as they present the account of God’s love for us in Jesus.  Our lesson features five approaches.  Eventually you will want to develop an approach that works best for you.

基督徒已经发现，很多提纲都可以用来引导他们讲述神在耶稣里对我们的爱。我们的课程主要谈论其中的五种，你在最后将找出最适合你的一种方法。

The good news of God’s love for us can be summed up in only two Scripture principles: 

神爱我们的好消息可以归纳成两个圣经原则：

1. the problem of the unattainable demands of God’s law and 

    人无法达到神的律法要求人达到的标准问题

2. the solution of the free gift of God’s grace in Jesus. (For example consider Romans 3:23,24 and Romans 6:23.) 

    神在耶稣里白白赐给人的恩典能解决这个问题（如，思考罗3:23,24 和罗6:23）
	
When we witness we tell others about God’s justice and his love, about God’s law and gospel. We must speak the law because it is God’s message to show that none of us can save ourselves from the punishment we deserve as sinners. We gladly tell the good news of Jesus, proclaiming how he saved us from sin’s punishment and that through faith in him God gives us the free gift of eternal life…. Consider what Christ has done for our salvation: He lived a perfect life for us under God’s law. He died for us to pay the debt of everyone’s sin. He rose from the dead to prove and proclaim his victory for us. Let people see Jesus and the vital truth that he is the world’s Savior! (Source: Confidently Sharing Jesus with Friends, WELS Evangelism.) 

我们向人作见证，就是要给他们讲述神的公义和慈爱，告诉他们神的律法和福音。我们必须要提律法，因为那是神给人的信息，要让人看到我们没有一个人能救自己脱离罪人当受的惩罚。然后我们欣喜地把耶稣的好消息告诉他们，讲明他怎样拯救我们脱离罪的惩罚，以及通过相信他，神把永生的礼物白白赐给我们----。思考基督为救赎我们做了什么事情：他为我们活出了神的律法所要求的完美生命；他替我们死，还清了每一个人的罪债；他死而复生，证明并宣告他为我们赢得了胜利。通过你的讲述，要让人们看到耶稣，以及他是世人救主这一至关重要的真理。（来源：自信地与朋友分享福音，WELS 传道）	


When we talk about God’s law we emphasize our failure to obey God (sin). The law tells us that the perfect God demands sinless perfection of us. Since no one can be absolutely moral like God, the law insists that we are worthy of God’s punishment. The law tells us that God is absolutely just: when he promises to punish our sin, he means it.  Note that the law diagnoses our terminal disease but does not provide us with a cure. 

当我们谈论神的律法时，我们要强调人靠自己无法做到顺服神（这就是罪）。因为律法告诉我们，完美的神要求我们也必须完美、无罪。因为没有人能像神一样绝对完美，所以律法指出，我们必须要受神的惩罚。律法告诉我们，神是绝对公正的：当他许诺说要惩罚我们的罪时，他就一定会那样做。注意，律法检查出我们得了致命的疾病，但却不能使我们得到痊愈。

Fortunately, God has provided us with a solution for our sin problem. Through his Son Jesus, he has paid for every way we will ever violate God’s commands, he has forgiven us completely, and he has adopted us as his children.  That good news (another term for the gospel) proclaims that our dearly-loved relationship with God is guaranteed and eternal life with him in heaven is guaranteed.

幸运的是，神为我们罪的问题提供了一个解决办法。神让他的儿子耶稣偿还了他要人付出的所有罪的代价，完完全全地赦免了我们，并接纳我们作他的孩子。那个好消息（福音的另一个名称）宣告，我们与神的亲密关系有了保证，能够在天堂与他同在的永恒生命也有了保证。

  <tr>
   <td>Note:  We cannot bring ourselves to faith in Jesus.  We do not choose to have him as our Savior.  We are incapable of making that decision.  Our sinfulness has spiritually paralyzed us and robbed us of the ability to make any move in God’s direction. Fortunately, the Holy Spirit works through the message of God’s grace to bring us to faith.  So from start to finish, we are saved entirely by God; we contribute nothing.  Compare John 15:16, Romans 5:8, Ephesians 2:1, 2:5, 2:8.<br />注意：我们不能依靠自己的努力让自己做到相信耶稣；我们自己无法做出让他作救主的决定，因为我们没有能力那样做。我们的罪性让我们在灵性上瘫痪了，无力向神的方向做出一点点移动。幸运的是，圣灵透过神的恩典信息做工，带领我们相信。所以，自始至终，我们完全是被神拯救的，没有自己的丝毫贡献。（对比约15:16，罗2:1；2:5；2:8.）</td>

There are many ways to summarize what the Bible tells us about our sin and God’s grace. For example, each of the outlines below presents the demands of God’s law and the guarantees of his gospel. Commit at least one of these approaches to memory during this next week.

有很多方法可以用来总结圣经对罪和神的恩典方面的教导。例如：下面的每个提纲都可以用来呈现神律法的要求以及福音给人的保证。下周要至少记住其中的一个方法。

###### Problem/PROBLEM/SOLUTION/solution 问题/问题/解答/解答

Often when an unbelieving person faces problems he realizes he can't handle, he looks for a new approach.  We Christians have the solution he is wanting to find. So his problem becomes an opening to share our faith. We can talk about his problem, our biggest problem (sin), God’s solution (his grace in Jesus), and how God’s grace guarantees he will provide solutions to our problems while we live here.   

一个不信主的人遇到自己难以解决的问题时，通常会去寻找新的办法。当我们基督徒正好拥有他所需要的解决办法时，这个问题就成了我们能与他分享信仰见证的切入口。我们可以谈论他的问题、谈论我们最大的问题（罪）、神的解决方法（他在耶稣里的恩典），以及神的恩典怎样保证他会给我们提供办法，解决我们在世上遇到的问题。

Let’s set the scene.  Your friend confides in you that he is dealing with a problem; he doesn’t know what to do; he wishes there was a way out.  Here’s a way to use this as a witnessing opportunity.

我们来做好准备。你的朋友向你透露，他正在面对一个问题；他不知道该怎么办；他希望能找到出路。下面就是一个可以用来作见证的机会。

- Express empathy for the person and the problem he is dealing with.  “I'm really sorry that your husband left you.”  One might share something about one's own life so the person knows you can understand in some way, for example, “John and I broke up for a while about two years ago.  That was a terrible time for me.”  

- 向对方及他面临的问题表示同情。“我很难过你的丈夫离开了你。”你也可以分享一些你自己生活中的类似经历，让他知道你能理解他。比如：“约翰和我两年前分开了一段时间，那时候我特别难过。”

- Point the person to the real PROBLEM: sin.  “When my life has gone topsy, it's reminded me that at the heart of all these problems is that we live in a world ruined by sin.  I'm not perfect; no one I live with is perfect.  We wrong each other and can't but keep hurting each other.  And there seems to be no way out. 

![](/images/note/evangelism-2/6-2.jpg#right)


- 把真正的问题指出来：罪。“ 当我的世界开始天旋地转时，它提醒我一件事：所有这些问题的中心在于，我们活在一个被罪玷污的世界中。我不完美，我周围的人也没有一个是完美的。我们彼此误会，免不了不断彼此伤害，似乎没有解决的办法。


- Talk about the SOLUTION to the PROBLEM: share how God has forgiven sin in Jesus.  “When I feel so frustrated because nothing and no one's perfect, how glad I am to know that God has provided us with a way to be forgiven for sin.  (Put the second part of the Apostles' Creed in your own words.)”  

- 谈论问题的解决办法：分享神在耶稣里怎样赦免人的罪。“当我意识到世界上没有一件完美的事，没有一个完美的人时，我感到极度沮丧。但又知道神为我们提供了解决办法，让我们的罪得到赦免时，我一下子开心起来（用自己的话讲解使徒信经的第二部分）。

- Explain how trusting that God loved you enough to solve your greatest PROBLEM by sending his Son as your Savior also proves he'll love you enough to help you deal with all your other problems.  “I've learned that if God would spend his Son on me so I could be forgiven, he also has to care enough to help me with all the rest of my hurts and disappointments.  And he has.”  [Add a personal example, for instance: “My marriage to John has been a lot better since Jesus has been a part of our lives.  I'm sure he'll do the same for you.”]

解释你为什么相信神能帮助你解决你所有的问题？因为你相信，神对你的爱既然深到愿意为你差遣他的儿子作你的救主来解决你最大的问题，就足以证明他对你的爱也会深到愿意帮助你解决所有其它问题。“我认识到，如果神愿意用他儿子的性命为代价来让我得着赦免，他一定也会足够在乎我、帮助我面对我所有其它的受伤和失望。而且他确实帮助了我。”（加入个人见证事例，比如：“自从耶稣成为我生命的一部分之后，我和约翰的婚姻便有了很大的好转。我深信他也会为你做同样的事情。”）

###### Witnessing by Colors 用颜色作见证

It’s not hard to remember four colors.  Four colors provide a helpful outline for sharing the Savior with others.  Some Christians use one inch square pieces of paper or fabric, glued or stapled together, made of these three colors and call it a wordless book.  Some have bracelets with beads using these three colors.

记住四个颜色并不难。四个颜色能提供一个与人分享救主的很有帮助的提纲。一些基督徒可以用纸或布料做成一个正方形小书，用胶粘起来，或者用订书机订起来。小书有三种颜色，但是没有字，所以把它叫做无字书。还有些人用这几种颜色的珠子串成手链戴在手上。

- The first color is dirty gray.  This represents how sin robs us of our perfection (white) and makes us unacceptable to God. 

- 第一种颜色是看起来较脏的灰色。这代表人的罪怎样夺去了我们的完美（白色），让我们无法被神接纳。

    Isaiah 64:6, All of us have become like one     who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.

    赛64:6     我们都像不洁净的人，所有的义都像污秽的衣服； 

- The second color is red, the color of Jesus' blood.  Red reminds us to talk about how God found a way to forgive our sins by washing us in Jesus' blood, by accepting Jesus' perfect life and suffering death as the full price for the punishment we deserved. 

- 第二种颜色是红色，是耶稣宝血的颜色。红色让我们可以谈论神怎样找到解决问题的办法，即通过耶稣在十字架上流出宝血洗净我们，让我们接受耶稣完美的生命和他的死亡，以此作为我们应受惩罚的全部代价，使我们的罪得着赦免。

    Ephesians 1:7, In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace.

    以弗所书1:7 我们藉这爱子的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照他丰富的恩典。

- White is the color that describes believers as sin-free before God; through Jesus God sees us as perfect and acceptable to him. 

- 白色用来描述信徒在神面前被洁净的无罪生命；透过耶稣，神看我们是完美的，并接纳了我们。

- Revelation 7:13-14, One of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?”  I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 

- 启示录7:13-14 长老中有一位问我说：“这些穿白衣的是谁？是从哪里来的？”我对他说：“我主，你知道。”他向我说：“这些人是从大患难中出来的，曾用羔羊的血把衣裳洗白净了。

- The final color,green, encourages talk about the transformation that will take place in the life of the believer.  Because God has been so gracious, the Christian will want to live to thank him.  He will want to learn all he can about his Father, he will want to live to please his Father; he will want to help others grow closer to God.

- 最后一个颜色是绿色，鼓励我们谈论发生在信徒生命中的改变。因为神的如此恩典，基督徒愿意活出一个向他感恩的生命。他会愿意尽力去认识他的天父，愿意让他的天父开心；他会愿意帮助他人更加亲近神。
    1 Peter 2:2; 2Peter 3:18, Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation... Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

    彼前2:2; 彼后3:18,

    2:2	就要爱慕那纯净的灵奶，像才生的婴孩爱慕奶一样，叫你们因此渐长，以致得救。
彼后3:18 你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们！

###### The Roman Way 罗马人的方式

This approach works well if you can open a Bible to allow your friend to see for him/herself what God says there. That way they don't have to take your word for it. 

这个方法让你打开圣经，让你的朋友自己看神在那里说了什么。那样，他们就不需要只听你讲话了。

- Romans 3:10, "There is no one righteous, not even one." And Romans 3:23, "There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." 

- 罗3:10 就如经上所记：“没有义人，连一个也没有；3:23 因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”

    o Point: No one has lived up to what God's justice demands of us.

    o 要点：没有人达到神要求人达到的公义标准。

- Romans 6:23a, "The wages of sin is death…." 

- 罗6:23	因为罪的工价乃是死；

    o Point: The result of failing to keep God's demands is death: eternal punishment in hell.

    o 要点：不遵守神命令的结果就是死亡：在地狱中承受永远的刑罚。

- Romans 6:23b, “The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." 

- 罗6:23	惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。

    o Point: Although we deserve God's punishment because of our sins, God has given us eternal life.  Since it is a gift, we don't pay for it in any way.

    o 要点：尽管我们的罪让我们该受神的惩罚，但神却把永恒的生命赐给了我们。因为这是一个礼物，我们不需要用任何方式来偿还。

- Romans 5:8, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." And Romans 5:11, "We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation." 

- 罗5:8	惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。

    5:11	不但如此，我们既藉着我主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就藉着他以神为乐。

    o Point: The reason God can forgive us is because he punished Jesus instead of punishing us.  That satisfies the demands of his justice ("The wages of sin is death...") and satisfies his love that wants us with him forever in heaven.  We are reconciled with God; God made us his friends.

    o 要点：神之所以能赦免我们的罪，是因为他惩罚了耶稣，而没有惩罚我们。耶稣代替我们接受惩罚的行为满足了神公义的要求（“罪的代价就是死亡---”），也满足了他爱我们、想要我们与他永远同在天堂的心愿。耶稣使我们得以与神和好，使我们成为他的朋友。

- Romans 10:9, "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." 

- 罗10:9	你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。

    o Point:  God's forgiveness and our reconciliation with him become ours through faith.  Do you believe that God has forgiven you through Jesus?  Then you are forgiven and reconciled.

    o 要点：通过相信，我们得着了神的赦免，并且与他之间的关系得以和好。你相信神已经透过耶稣赦免你了吗？那么你就已经被赦免，而且与神和好了。

- Romans 10:17, "Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ."

- 罗10:17可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。

    o Point: Now you'll want to get to know that loving Father even more.  We do that through listening to his Word.  And the better we get to know him, the more our faith grows.  Will you come to worship and Bible study with me this weekend to hear more?

    o 要点：现在，你会想要更多地认识那位慈爱的天父。我们通过聆听他的话语就可以更多认识他。而且我们越认识他，就会越有信心。你愿意这个周末和我一起来参加崇拜聚会，学习圣经，聆听他的话语吗？

###### The One Verse Method  一句经文法

In this approach you diagram Romans 6:23 as demonstrated to the right.

这种方法需要你把罗马书6:23用图表的形式画出来，如右图所示。

![](/images/note/evangelism-2/6-3.jpg#right)


Here’s what the passage says: “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Explain the passages in these steps. Write out the words in the diagram as you work through each step.

经文说：“因为罪的工价乃是死；（但是）惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”用下面几个步骤来解释这段经文。把每个步骤写在图表里。

1. Speak first about the demands of God’s law as described in the words: wages, sin, and death. 

    先说神的律法对人的要求，如词语中所描述的：工价（wages），罪(sin)，和死(death)。

2. The but is a transitional word: in spite of the wages of our sins, God has a different outcome in store for us.

    但是 (But)是一个转折词：尽管我们犯罪的代价是---，但神为我们预备了不一样的结局。

3. Speak next about the gospel as described in the words: gift, of God, and eternal life. 

    然后讲解这些词里面描述的福音内容：神的礼物/恩赐(Gift)，和永生(Eternal Life)。

4. Announce that all this is ours in Jesus, who is our Savior. (You might note that “Christ” is the Greek word for Messiah and that, when Paul and other New Testament writers describe Jesus as Lord, they are emphasizing not only that he is the master, but, even more, that he is the ruler of the universe who came to be our Savior.)  Through his life, death and resurrection, Jesus completely paid for our sins, saved us from their punishment, and has given us eternal life with him in heaven.

    You may find the script for this method at the end of this lesson helpful.

    宣告所有这些都在耶稣我们救主里面归于我们（你可以解释“基督”在希腊语的意思是弥赛亚。而且保罗和其他新约书卷作者在描述耶稣是神时，他们强调的不仅是耶稣是主，他更是宇宙的主宰，但却来到世间作我们的救主）。耶稣通过他的生、死和复活，为我们还清了罪的代价，拯救我们脱离惩罚，赐给我们与他同在天堂的永恒生命。
    
    这篇讲义的末尾有这个方法的剧本，可能会对你有帮助。

###### A “Handy” Way to Witness “得心应手”的见证方法

![](/images/note/evangelism-2/6-4.jpg#right)

- Thumb (the problem): Does their spiritual situation rate a thumbs up (God’s favor) or a thumbs down (God’s disfavor)?

- 大拇指（问题）：他们的属灵状况应该是大拇指朝上（让神喜悦），还是大拇指朝下（神不喜悦）？

    o Point:  God gives us a thumbs down. We are far from perfect. We may not have done anything that would result in our being imprisoned, but day after day we hurt, show disrespect, and fail to love ourselves and others.  (Confer Romans 3:23, 5:12.)

    o 要点：神向我们伸出的大拇指是朝下的，因为我们很不完美。我们可能没有做任何该让我们坐牢的事情，但我们却在日复一日地伤害着自己和他人，不尊敬也不爱自己和他人。（参照罗马书3:23, 5:12）


- First Finger (pointing finger)

- 食指（用于指点）

    o Point: God points out our sin and pronounces his angry punishment. (Confer Matthew 5:48, Romans 6:23a.)

    o 要点：神指出我们的罪，宣告他的怒气和惩罚（参照太5:48，罗6:23a）

- Middle Finger (longest finger)

- 中指（最长的指头）

    o Point: People argue with God. They believe that they are big enough, good enough.  They believe that they can measure up to the demands of the perfect God.  They compare themselves with others.  They think they can lift themselves higher. But they are not measuring themselves by the right standard. They are not measuring themselves against their God’s demands. (Confer Proverbs 14:12, Romans 3:10.)

    o 要点：人与神辩解。他们相信自己已经够大也够好，相信自己能达到神完美的要求；他们拿自己和别人比较，认为自己能把自己提得更高一些，但他们却没有使用正确的标准来衡量自己。他们并没有按照神要求的标准来衡量自己。（参照箴14:12，罗3:10）

- Ring Finger (finger for wedding ring, symbol of love)

- 无名指（戒指，戴结婚戒指的手指，是爱的象征）

    o In spite of our sinfulness and inability to please God, God has provided the only way we could be right with him.  He paid for our sinfulness.  He sent his Son to earth as a human being in order to be punished in our place. Jesus died on the cross to pay for our sinfulness. His resurrection from the dead guarantees he accomplished his mission. Why would God do this for us?  God is love; he loves us in spite of our sins.  The Bible calls that love grace, love we don’t deserve.  (Confer Romans 5:8, Ephesians 1:7.)

    o 尽管我们有罪，没有能力得神的喜悦，但神仍然为人预备了一个与他和好的办法，一个能与他和好的唯一办法。他自己付清了我们的罪债，让他的儿子以人的样式来到世间，代替我们接受惩罚。耶稣在十字架上受死是为了偿还我们的罪应付的代价。他又死而复活，保证了他确实完成了救赎的使命。神为何要为我们做这件事？因为神是爱；尽管我们有罪，他却仍然爱我们。圣经称这种爱为恩典，是一种我们不配得的爱。（参照罗5:8；弗1:7）

- Little Finger (“I” in sign language. This finger allows us to talk about the way grace comes to us personally through faith in Jesus) 

- 小指（在手语中代表“我”。这个手指让我们能够谈论恩典临到我们个人的方式，那就是透过相信耶稣。）

    o Point: What Jesus did becomes ours through faith which is created and sustained by God working through his Word. (Confer Romans 5:1,2, Ephesians 2:8,9.)

    o 要点：耶稣所做的一切透过我们的相信而属于我们个人。这个方法是神借助他的话语所设计和维持的。（参照5:1,2；弗2:8,9）

- Open Hand (an invitation to hear more about God’s love)

- 伸开的手掌（邀请人更多聆听神的爱）

    o Point: Now that you’ve heard about how much God loves you that he sent his Son to be your Savior, you must have many questions.  God and I want to invite you to learn more as we study more of God’s Word.  (Confer Matthew 11:28, Romans 10:17.)

    o 要点：你已经听到神对你的爱，知道神差他的儿子来作你的救主，你一定有很多问题要问。神和我想邀请你通过学习他的话语来更多了解他。（参照太11:28；罗10:17）

###### The Simple Truth 简单的真理

This approach to explaining God’s grace uses simple line drawing as an outline. It begins with discussing what people normally believe about making themselves right with God. It demonstrates why we can’t expect anything we do will give us an acceptable relationship with God. It concludes with showing how only God’s grace in Jesus can provide a loved and forgiven relationship with God.

这一用来解释神恩典的方法使用简单的线条画出提纲。先讨论人们通常相信的能使自己与神恢复正常关系的方法，再呈现我们为什么不能指望自己做任何事情来让神接纳我们，恢复与神的正常关系；最后再指出，只有神在耶稣基督里的恩典能给我们提供一个蒙爱的、得赦免的关系。

The conversation with a grace friend might be turned to a spiritual topic by asking, “What do you think will give people a good relationship with God.”  Your friend’s answer will have something to do with how we must do something to make ourselves right with God. Listen closely to their answer. Ask questions so you understand what they are saying.


与恩典朋友的对话可以向属灵话题转动的提问有：“你认为人怎样才能恢复与神之间的正常关系？”你的朋友可能会说到人必须怎样做才能让自己与神恢复关系，认真听他们的回答，并提出问题来帮助你理解他们说的话。

In response you might say, “Most people would agree with you. [You could add, if you can honestly say this, There was a time when I thought that, too.] But I’ve discovered that there has to be another way to come under God’s favor. May I share that with you?”

你可以这样回应他们：“多数人会同意你的说法（如果正好也是你曾经有的想法，你也可以补充说，你曾经也是那么想的）。不过我发现，必须还要有另一个方法，一个让神满意的方法。我可以跟你分享这个方法吗？”

“I found that the problem with thinking I needed to do something to make myself right with God was I could never do anything well enough to please God because he is perfect and is only satisfied with perfection.  The Bible says, ‘Just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written, 
"Be holy, because I am holy’ (1 Peter 1:15,16).” 

我发现，认为自己必须要做什么事情来恢复与神之间关系的想法存在一个问题，就是我无论怎样做，做得无论有多好，都无法达到让神满意的程度。因为他是完美的，只有完美才能达到他的标准。圣经说：“那召你们的既是圣洁，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。因为经上记着说：‘你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。’（彼前1:15-16）


![](/images/note/evangelism-2/6-5.jpg#center)

“For that reason, my trying to do good things won’t ever be good enough. Getting right with God is not like climbing a ladder where even though we are not perfect today, we keep climbing toward perfection and one day we get there.  Being perfect is not just doing more good than bad. Some people think that as long as their good deeds outweigh their bad deeds God is satisfied. But being perfect is doing no bad at all, ever. Some people solve the problem of not being perfect by thinking they are God or at least they will one day grow into a god. But God says, I am the only God. You can never be like me. Finally, there are people think they are on good terms with God as long as they are better than most others.  But God doesn’t want us to judge our goodness based on how we compare with the goodness of other people. God insists that we compare ourselves with him, the holy God.” 

“因此，我努力做的所有好事最终还是不够好，因为恢复与神的关系并不像爬梯子。不能说我们今天虽然还不够完美，但只要我们坚持向完美的方向努力，就总有一天会到达终点；达到完美也不只是多做好事，少做坏事。有些人以为，只要他们做的好事多，坏事少，神就会对他满意。可是完美的意思是要求我们永远都不能做一丁点儿坏事；还有些人解决自己不完美问题的方法是，他们认为自己就是神，或者至少有一天自己会变成神。但是神说：“我是独一的神。你永远都不可能变成我。”最后，还有人想，只要他们比大多数其他人做得更好，他们就可以和神有好的关系。但是神不想让我们通过和别人比较的方法来衡量自己的善行，他要我们拿来对比的对象是他自己，是圣洁、完美的神。”

“The Bible says, ‘All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). None of us, no matter how good we seem measure up to God’s expectations.  When we fall short of God’s expectations, we deserve his punishment. The Bible tells us, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law’ (Galatians 3:10).”

“圣经说：‘世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀（罗3:23）。无论我们有多好，我们都没有一个人能达到神要求我们达到的标准。我们亏缺了神的荣耀，该受的就只有惩罚。圣经告诉我们： “凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。”（加3:10）

“So is there a way for us to escape God's punishment?  The Bible says there is. But it’s a way that only God can provide us.  Here’s how the Bible explains that, ‘God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life’ (John 3:16).”

“那么，有没有办法让我们逃避神的惩罚呢？圣经上说有办法，但那个办法只有神才能提供，正如圣经向我们解释说：‘神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。’（约3:16）

“We can have eternal life with God because God sent his Son to earth to forgive all the things we do wrong.  That’s why Jesus lived. In Jesus the Son of God became a human being, one of us. He became one of us to take our place, to pay our punishment for our sins. The Bible tells us that Jesus ‘himself bore our sins in his body on the tree’ on the Roman cross where he was executed (1 Peter 2:24).  When Jesus died God was holding his Son responsible for every sin that will ever be committed.  God choose to punish his Son so he would not have to punish us.  Jesus didn’t die on the cross as the result of his own sinfulness. As the Son of God he was perfect in every way for every moment of his life. The Bible explains, ‘God made [Jesus] who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God’ (2 Corinthians 5:21).

我们可以永远与神同在，享受永生，因为神差了他的儿子到世间来，赦免了我们所做的一切不完美的事情。这就是为什么耶稣要成为人来到世间的原因。神的儿子耶稣成为我们中间的一员，代替我们的位置，为我们承担了罪的刑罚。圣经告诉我们，耶稣在罗马十字架上被钉死时，他‘被挂在木头上，亲身担当了我们的罪’（彼前2:24）。耶稣被钉死了，因为神要他来替人承担人所犯的每一个罪的代价。神决定惩罚他的儿子，使人可以不必受罚。耶稣死在十字架上，不是因为他自己犯了罪。因为他是神的儿子，他在自己一生中的任何一个方面都是完美的。圣经解释说，‘神使那无罪的（“无罪”原文作“不知罪”），替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。’（林后5:21）

“God transformed us from sinners to saints when he substituted our sinfulness for Jesus' perfection.  Jesus’ death on the cross has provided us with the righteousness (the holiness, the perfection) we need to have a right relationship with God.” 

“当神用耶稣的完美替换我们的罪性时，神就把我们从罪人转变成圣徒。耶稣在十字架上的死亡给我们带来了与神恢复正常关系所需要的公义（圣洁和完美）。”

![](/images/note/evangelism-2/6-6.jpg#center)

“Here’s how we know that Jesus’ death has done that for us.  He came back from the dead. Just like the Bible had promised and Jesus predicted, three days after his death he rose from the dead. The Bible says that Jesus ‘was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification’ (Romans 4:25). Jesus’ resurrection proves God has pronounced us not guilty (that’s what justified means).”

“下面就是我们如何知道耶稣的死亡为我们做了哪些事情。他死而复活了，正如圣经所应许、耶稣曾预言过的，他在三天以后死而复活。圣经说：‘耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯；复活，是为叫我们称义（或作“耶稣是为我们的过犯交付了，是为我们称义复活了”罗4:25）。耶稣的复活证明神宣告我们是无罪的（那就是称义的意义）。

“Now by believing that is what God has done for me, my sins are forgiven and I have a right relationship with him. One of the followers of Jesus is quoted in the Bible, ‘[I am] found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law [trying to do good things), but that which is through faith in Christ – the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith’ (Philippians 3:9).”

现在，通过相信那些都是神为我做的事情，我的罪就得到赦免，我与神之间也因此有了正确的关系，我成为基督的一个跟随者。正如圣经所记：“（我）得以在他里面，不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义（腓3:9）。

###### Script for The One Verse Method 一节经文方法 剧本

We’ve been talking about the answer to “How can anyone be sure they have a healthy relationship with God?”  

我们一直在谈论怎样回答这个问题：“人怎样才能肯定他们和神之间拥有正确的关系？”。

There’s a Bible verse that sums up the answer to that question. It’s in the Apostle Paul’s letter to the Christians in Roman, chapter 6, verse 23.

有一处圣经经文总结了那个问题的方法。经文在使徒保罗写给罗马基督徒的书信中，罗马书第六章23节。

The passage says: “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  I’ve found this diagram helpful to understand this passage. See what you think.

经文说：“因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”我发现这个图表能帮助我们理解，你看怎么样？

The first part of Romans 6:23 talks about what God demands of us and how we fail to live up to his demands.  “The wages of sin is death.” 

罗马书6:23的第一部分说的是神对我们的要求，以及我们根本无法达到他的要求。“罪的工价（代价）就是死。” 

Sin is anything we do or say or think that doesn’t measure up to what God wants from us.  It is anything that is contrary to who God is.  The 10 Commandments summarize how God wants us to live. They talk about putting him first in our lives, showing him respect and worshiping him with everything we do.  They talk about showing love and respect to everyone else. We do that when we obey the people God has placed in positions of responsibility over us, when we protect the lives of others, when we live sexually moral lives, when we help others keep their property and good name, when we are satisfied with what God gives us.  

罪指的是我们所做、所说、所想的一切事情都无法达到神要求我们达到的标准。罪是与神的本性相背离的任何东西。十条诫命总结了神要我们如何生活的方式，谈到我们必须要把他放在我们生命中的首位，在我们所做的一切事情上尊敬他，敬拜他。里面也谈到我们要爱并且尊敬每一个人。当我们服从那些神放在那里来领导我们的人时，当我们保护他人的性命时，当我们过一种有操守和德行的生活时，当我们帮助他人维护他们的财务和名声时，当我们对神赐给我们的东西感到满足时，我们就是在向神表达我们对他的爱戴和尊敬。

I don’t keep any of those commandments as I should.  What about you?  Actually the Bible says, no one lives according to God’s commandments.  In Romans 3:23 the Bible says, "There is no difference [between any of us], for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." 

我并没有按照要求遵守那些命令，你怎么样呢？其实圣经说，没有一个人在按照神所要求的样式生活。罗马书3:23节说：“（大家都没有分别），因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”

There’s a price to pay for committing sins, a punishment that comes along with sin.  This verse talks about a wage that sin pays.  Usually wages are something we look forward to.  But the wages of sin are far from a positive.  

人犯罪以后就必须要付出犯罪的代价，就是必须承受从罪而来的惩罚。这节经文谈到了罪必须要付的代价。人们通常会期待得工价，但罪的工价或代价却绝不是什么好东西。

“The wages of sin is death.”  The rest of the Bible makes it plain that these wages are not just having bodies that will die some day.  The death that our sins earn is eternal death in the most horrible torture chamber you could imagine.  The Bible says that those who do not obey God “will be punished with everlasting destruction” (2 TH 1:9). That’s one of the ways the Bible describes hell.

“罪的工价乃是死。”整本圣经都清楚地表明，这些代价不仅仅是让人的身体有一天死去。我们的罪带来的死亡是永恒的死，是超过人所能想象的最痛苦的折磨。圣经说，不顺服神的，“他们要受刑罚，就是永远沉沦，离开主的面和他权能的荣光”（帖后1:9）。那是圣经对地狱的一种描述。

So the consequence of any amount of sin is eternal death, eternal punishment in hell.  No one should think that they can avoid that fate because we all sin, because we all fall short of what God demands of us.
	
所以，人的罪无论有多大，最终的结局都是永恒的死亡，是在地狱中永远受刑罚。不要妄想有人能逃避那种命运，因为所有人都犯了罪。我们都没有做到神要求我们做到的标准。

But look again at Romans 6:23.  The next word is only three letters but it changes everything. But.  It is a transitional word.  Hell is what we should expect from God, BUT....  In spite of the wages of our sins, God has a different outcome in store for us. God has a gift for us instead of the punishment we deserve. His gift is eternal life with him in heaven.

但是请再看罗马书6:23节，下一句话只有三个词，却改变了整个局面。里面包含的转折词让我们看到一个全新的盼望。我们都料想自己要面对的是地狱的刑罚，但是----；尽管我们的罪要我们付出地狱的代价，但神却为我们预备了不同的出路。神为我们准备了一个礼物，让我们不用再承受我们应该受的惩罚。他的礼物就是与他同在天堂的永恒生命。

How could that be?  God is the most just of all judges. We would not expect that a just judge would let a criminal simply go free. 

那怎么可能呢？神是所有法官中最公正的法官。我们不会想象一个公正的法官会让一个罪犯不受惩罚而简单走掉。 

But God hasn’t stopped being a just judge by relieving us of the wages of our sins and giving us eternal life.  What he arranged for was for someone else to take responsibility for the wages of our sins, for someone else to be paid our wages so we don’t have to face those consequences.

但神不是那个不公正的法官，会让我们不偿还罪的代价就给我们永恒的生命。他对我们的安排是让另一个人来替我们承担罪的刑罚，偿还罪的代价，使我们不用面对那些后果。

That’s what God did for us by sending his Son, Jesus, to earth.  “...But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” 

那就是神差他的儿子耶稣到世上来为我们做的事情。“---惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”

The reason Jesus left heaven to live on earth and to die on the cross was to pay for all of our sins. Jesus lived a sin-free life, the kind of life God demands of us but we don’t live.  When he died on the cross, he suffered the punishment in hell we have earned for ourselves with our sins.  And he was able to live a perfect enough life and suffer enough punishment when he hung on the cross to cover every sin that will ever be committed because he is the infinite Son of God.  The infinite Son of God paid for an infinite number of our sins.

耶稣离开天堂来到地上并死在十字架上的原因，就是来为我们所有的罪偿还代价。耶稣活出了一个无罪的生命，是神要求我们但我们没有活出来的那种完美生命。当他在十字架上牺牲时，他承受了我们的罪带给我们的地狱般的刑罚。他活出了一个足够完美的生命，并且在十字架上承受了足够的痛苦刑罚。那一切都足以让我们所犯的每一个罪被遮盖，因为他是无限之神的儿子。无限之神的儿子为我们无数的罪偿还了所有的代价。

So the Bible tells us in Romans 5:8, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Jesus took our place, he died for us, he suffered the eternal death that we should have experience. And in Romans 5:11 it says, "We also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation."  Reconciliation means that Jesus has made us God’s dear friends; we are no longer his enemies who deserve his angry punishment.

所以圣经在罗马书5:8告诉我们：“惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。”耶稣取代了我们的位置，替我们死了。他承受了我们应该承受的永恒死亡。在罗马书5:11中说：“不但如此，我们既藉着我主耶稣基督得与神和好，也就藉着他以神为乐。”与神和好的意思是耶稣已经让我们成为神的亲爱朋友；我们不再是必须承受他怒气惩罚的敌人了。

There is no better news than this: “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” That means, no matter what the sins are that you have committed, they are all forgiven in Jesus.  You have a Savior.  Your Savior is the Lord, the eternal God, who promised that he could come to earth to forgive our sins.  

再没有比这更好的消息了：“	因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”（罗6:23）它的意思是，无论你已经犯过怎样的罪，如今在耶稣里，它们已经全部被赦免了。你有一个救主，你的救主就是神，永恒的神。 他做过承诺要到世上来赦免我们的罪。

And because Jesus didn’t just die to forgive us but came back to life three days later, we can be sure beyond all doubt that he accomplished his mission. Through his life, death and resurrection, Jesus guarantees that he has completely paid for our sins, saved us from their punishment, and has given us eternal life with him in heaven.

因为耶稣不只是为了赦免我们的罪而死了，他还在三天以后复活了。所以我们可以毫无疑问地确信，他完成了他的使命。透过他的生、死和复活，耶稣保证，他已经替我们还清了所有的罪债，把我们从罪的刑罚中拯救出来，赐给我们永生，使我们与他在天堂享受永恒的生命。

Would you read this verse out loud with me:  “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” That’s his gift to you. Do you believe this? [Yes.] Then this gift from God belongs to you. Your sins are forgiven. Eternal life in heaven is waiting for you.

你可以和我一起朗读这处经文吗？“罗6:23	因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。”那是他给你的礼物，你相信吗？（是的。）那么这个从神而来的礼物就是你的了。你的罪被赦免了。天堂永恒的生命在等待着你。

###### Script for A "Handy" Way to Witness “得心应手”的见证方法剧本

I’ve found that my hand is an easy way to understand what the Bible says about how I can be sure God loves me and one day will take me to live with him in heaven. Can I  share this with you? [Yes.]

我们谈论过我怎样才能肯定圣经所说神爱我，有一天要带我与他同住天堂？的问题，我发现我可以用我的手来解释，我现在可以解释给你听吗？（可以！）

Let’s start with the thumb.  Does God give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down? It’s got to be a thumbs down, doesn’t it.  God is perfect in every way, but we are far from perfect. Yet perfection is what God demands of us.  Jesus said, “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect (Matthew 5:48). 

我们就从大拇指开始吧！你认为神会给我们一个大拇指朝上的手势，还是大拇指朝下的手势呢？一定是大拇指朝下的手势，是不是？神在任何一个方面都是完美的，但我们离完美的距离还很远。然而神对我们的要求就是完美，因为耶稣说：“你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。（太5:48）。”

God demands that we be perfect.  Now we may not have done anything that should result in our going to prison, but day after day we hurt others, we show them disrespect, and we fail to love others, In fact, we fail to love ourselves.  The Bible says of us, “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).  "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). “In this way death came to all people, because all sinned” (Romans 5:12).

神对我们的要求是我们要完全/完美。虽然我们没有做任何让我们坐牢的事情，但我们却时常在伤害他人，不尊敬人，没能去爱人。事实上，我们也没能爱自己。圣经说 “我们都像不洁净的人，所有的义都像污秽的衣服（赛64:6） 。”“世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀（罗3:23）。”“	于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪（罗5:12）”。

That’s the next finger, the index finger, the finger of accusation. 

God points his finger at us and points out our sin.  Then, since he’s a just judge, he pronounces his just and angry punishment on us.  “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23a), is his judgment.  I will punish you with eternal death in hell for your sins; that’s what you have earned by breaking my commandments.  The Bible says that those who do not obey God “will be punished with everlasting destruction” (2 TH 1:9). 

那就是下一个手指，无名指，控告人的指头。

神的手指在指着我们，指出我们的罪。然后，因为他是一个公正的审判官，他向我们宣布他公正而愤怒的惩罚。“罪的工价乃是死”（罗6:23a），这就是他的判决。因为你的罪，我要以地狱永远的死亡来惩罚你；那就是人违背神的命令造成的后果。圣经说，那些不顺服神的人，“他们要受刑罚，就是永远沉沦，离开主的面和他权能的荣光。”（贴后1:9）

But people argue with God. We believe that we are big enough, good enough, holy enough.  They believe that they can measure up to the demands of the perfect God.  They compare themselves with others.  That’s the middle finger, the longest finger. When we look around we can always find people that seem to be morally worse than we are. There are people who cheat at work, on their spouse, on their taxes. There are people who can’t control their tongues, their thoughts, their stomachs. “But I don’t do those things,” we say.

但人与神争辩说：我们相信我们是足够大、足够好也足够圣洁。他们相信他们能达到完美之神的要求。他们把自己拿来与他人比较，就是中指，最长的那个指头。我们向四周观看时，总能找到道德比我们差的人。有人在工作中捣鬼，欺骗配偶，偷税漏税；还有人不能控制自己的舌头，思想和胃口。“但我不是那样。”我们说。

When we think like that we conclude God must be satisfied with us because we are not as bad as other people. But the Bible says about that kind of thinking, “There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death” (Proverbs 14:12). 

我们那样想的原因是希望能得出这样一种结论：神一定会对我满意，因为我不像其他人那么糟糕。但圣经针对那种想法说：“有一条路人以为正，至终成为死亡之路。”（箴14:12）	

Here’s the problem with thinking like that: we are comparing ourselves to the wrong standard.  God doesn’t demand that we live more moral lives than most people.  He demands that we live lives that are as moral, as holy, as pure as he is. But he says about us, “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:10).  

那种想法的错误在于：我们拿来作对比的标准错了。神对我们的要求不是要我们过一个比大多数人更有道德的生活，而是要我们过一个像他一样有道德、圣洁、纯全的生活。但他说我们之中 “没有义人，连一个也没有；没有明白的，没有寻求神的；”（罗3:10-11）		

Which brings us to the ring finger, the finger for a wedding ring, the symbol of lifelong love. 

In spite of our sinfulness and our inability to please God, God has committed himself to love us. There is nothing loveable he sees in us, no reason we give him to love us. But he still loves us. There is a special Bible word to describe that love: grace.  Grace is God’s intense and eternal love for us, a love we don’t deserve.  

接下来就是我们的无名指，用来戴结婚戒指的手指，象征一生的爱。

尽管我们有罪，不能让神喜悦，但神还是决定爱我们。他在我们身上没有看到任何可爱之处；我们不能给他任何理由让他来爱我们，但他仍然爱我们。圣经用了一个特别的词来描述这种爱：恩典。恩典是神对我们坚定而永恒的爱，一种我们不配得到的爱。

We could never make ourselves right with God, but God in grace has provided the only way we could be right with him.  We could never make up for all the sins we commit, but God in grace has paid for our sinfulness.  

我们靠自己的努力永远不能摆正与神的关系，只有神在他的恩典里为我们提供了仅有的一个方法，让我们能和他恢复正当的关系。我们所犯的罪永远无法弥补，但神在恩典中替我们偿还了我们的罪债。

This is what he has done: He sent his Son to earth as a human being to take our place before his judgment seat.  His Son came here as Jesus of Nazareth in order to live that perfect life we are incapable of living.  He substitutes that perfect life for our sinful lives.  Jesus came to earth to be punished in our place. Jesus died on the cross to pay for our sinfulness. His death has been substituted for the eternal death we should suffer.  And Jesus’ resurrection from the dead is the guarantee that he accomplished his mission. 

他为我们做的事情有：他差遣他的儿子成为人的样式来到人间，在他的审判台前取代了我们的位置。他的儿子来到人间被称为拿撒勒的耶稣，就是要为我们活出一个我们无法活出的完美生命。他用自己完美的生命替换了我们有罪的生命。耶稣来到世上代替我们接受惩罚。他死在十字架上为我们偿还罪债。他的死亡取代了我们该受的永恒灭亡。而且耶稣的死而复生保证了他确实完成了他来地上要完成的使命。

Why would God do this for us?  Because “God is love” (1 John 4:8).  Jesus says, “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son” to be our Savior (John 3:16). Another Bible verse says, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). Another verse says, “In [Jesus] we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.” Redemption is a fancy word for buying back; Jesus’ life and death bought us back from the punishment we deserve from God.  And why did God make that happen?  “We have redemption... in accordance with the riches of God’s grace” (Ephesians 1:7).

神为什么要为我们做这些事？因为“神是爱”（约一4:8）。耶稣说：“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们”，让他作我们的救主（约3:16）。另一处圣经经文说：“惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了”（罗5:8）。还有一处经文说：“我们藉这爱子[耶稣]的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免”。救赎的意思是买回来；耶稣的生和死把我们从我们该受的惩罚中买赎回来。神为什么要那样做呢？我们被买回来，“乃是照他丰富的恩典”（弗	1:7）。	

So because of his love for us, his grace, God has provided us with forgiveness.  So forgiveness and heaven are available to us.  But how does it become ours?

Our little fingers are a reminder about that.  In sign language the little finger stands for the pronoun “I” or “me.”  How does God’s grace in Jesus come to me?  It comes to us personally through faith in Jesus, through trusting that the Bible’s message about Jesus is the truth.

所以，因为他对我们的爱，出于他的恩典，神给我们提供了赦免，使我们今天可以得着赦免和天堂。但赦免和天堂怎样才能成为我们所有呢？

我们的小手指在提醒我们这一点。在手语中，小手指代表代词“我”。神在耶稣里的恩典是怎样临到我呢？是借助相信耶稣，通过相信圣经中有关耶稣的信息是真理，它就属于我们了。

Let’s go back to John 3:16, “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”  Everything Jesus did for us–his perfect life, his hell-suffering death–becomes ours through faith.  The Bible says, “It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works [not by anything we do], so that no one can boast” (Ephesians 2:8,9). 

我们回到约3:16，“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”耶稣为我们做的一切，包括他为我们活出完美的生命，承受地狱的死忘，通过我们的相信而属于我们。圣经说：“你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为[不是我们所做的任何事情]，免得有人自夸。”（弗2:8-9）		

Another verse says, “Since we have been justified through faith [justify is a word from the courtroom that means to be pronounced not guilty], we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand” (Romans 5:1,2,).

另一处经文说：“我们既因信称义[称义是法庭用词，指宣告无罪]，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。我们又藉着他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀”(罗5:1-2)。		

Do you have any questions? Does this make sense to you? Do you believe that Jesus has forgiven all your sins? [Yes.] Then I must assure you that God has forgiven you for everything you have done wrong, he is committed to shepherd you through this life, and one day he will take you to be with him in heaven.

你有什么问题吗？你觉得能理解吗？你相信耶稣已经赦免了你所有的罪吗？[是的]。那我必须再跟你确定一件事情，就是神已经赦免了你的一切错误。他一定会看顾你的一生，而且有一天会带你与他同在天堂里。

There is one more thing. All of this brings us to the open hand, to God’s invitation to hear more about his love for you. God and I want to invite you to learn more about who he is and how committed he is to you. We do that as we spend time in his Word. 

接下来，我们看到的是一只伸开的手掌，这是神在邀请我们更多了解他，聆听他爱你的信息。神和我一起邀请你更多认识他，了解他是谁，以及他多么甘心为你付出。我们花时间读他的话语时就能更多了解和认识他。

The Bible explains, “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ” (Romans 10:17). And Jesus invites you, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). 

圣经解释说：“可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的”（罗10:17）。而且耶稣邀请你：“凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。”（太11:28）	

Would you come to worship with me this Sunday?  I have many friends there who would love to meet you. But most of all we get to learn more about God’s love for us at worship. The service starts at 9:30a. Could I pick you up a little after 9:00a?

你愿意这个周日和我一起去参加崇拜吗？我那里有很多朋友想见你。不过最主要的是，我们在崇拜中可以更多认识神对我们的爱。聚会上午9:30开始。我可以9点过一点来接你吗？
