When Paul wrote his letter to the Romans, he described many of the differences between people who are Christians and those who are not. Those differences begin with understanding that non-Christians are controlled by a human nature that is thoroughly sinful. Christians also have a sinful human nature, but, more importantly, they have a new nature, that now controls their lives, their values, their desires. 

保罗写信给罗马教会时，提到了信与不信者之间的很多差别。其中，首先要认识到的是非基督徒是完全被罪性所控制的。基督徒虽然也还有罪性，但更重要的是，他们现在有一个新的性情在控制他们的生命、价值和欲望。 


In Romans 8:5-8 Paul writes, “Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.  Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.” (Paul has more to say about the characteristics of unbelievers in Romans 1:18-32.) 

保罗在罗马书8:5-8节中写到：

“8:5	因为随从肉体的人，体贴肉体的事；随从圣灵的人，体贴圣灵的事。

8:6	体贴肉体的就是死；体贴圣灵的乃是生命平安。

8:7	原来体贴肉体的，就是与　神为仇，因为不服　神的律法，也是不能服。

8:8	而且属肉体的人不能得　神的喜欢。

（保罗在罗马书1:18-32中还提到不信者的特点。）


Compare Paul’s list of the characteristics of unbelievers with the list you complied above. What does Paul confirm, add, and emphasize?   Is there anything on your list that you would now change?

把保罗所列的不信者的特点与你自己列出的做对比，找出保罗肯定、补充和强调的地方有哪些？你的列表中有没有现在需要修改的地方？

Since these are the characteristics of unbelievers, how should we expect that they will respond when we introduce them to the message of God’s grace?

既然这些是非信徒的特点，我们在给他们介绍神的恩典信息时，应该期待他们做出怎样的回应？

When unbelievers respond to the gospel in these ways, it shouldn’t surprise us. Nor should we allow ourselves to become defensive or angry.  This is simply the way people who are directed by their old Adams will act.  They are not able to act any differently until the Spirit uses the gospel to bring them to faith and creates a new nature in them.[  Confer Ephesians 2:4,5, “Because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved” and Romans 10:17, “Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.”]  The Spirit has given us the gospel (a message we will share with them wrapped in the grace we have found in Jesus) as the tool he will use to create that difference.

当非信徒以这些方式回应福音时，我们不应该感到惊奇。我们也不要允许自己开始变得自卫或生气。那些都只是受老亚当唆使的人发出的自然反应。他们不会有任何其它的表现，除非圣灵借着福音带他们相信，在他们里面制造一个新的性情[讨论以弗所书2:4,5节，"然而 神既有丰富的怜悯，因他爱我们的大爱，	当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来（你们得救是本乎恩）"罗马书10:17 "可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。"]圣灵已经把福音作为工具赐给我们（就是我们将要与他们分享的信息，包裹在耶稣里的恩典），他要用它来制造不同。

Jesus calls evangelism fishing for the souls of men and women.  When we attempt to catch fish, we go to the proper places and we use lures and bait that will attract the fish we seek to capture.  The same principle applies to catching human souls with the gospel.  How will these characteristics of unbelievers affect the way we share the gospel with them?  How will it affect our attitude toward them?


耶稣说传福音的工作就是在钓鱼，要把人的灵魂从灭亡的海洋中打捞上来。我们打算钓鱼时，就会去找一个合适的地方，用诱饵和鱼钩来吸引鱼，然后才能抓住。在用福音打捞人的灵魂时，应用的是同一个原则。不信者的这些特点怎样影响我们与他们分享福音的方式呢？它会怎样影响我们对待他们的态度？


|   Characteristic of unbelievers<br />不信者的特征   |   Our approach to sharing gospel<br />我们分享福音的方法   |   Our attitude toward them<br />我们对待他们的态度   |
|   -----    |    -----   |    -----    |
|  Dead in sin<br />死在罪中  |          |             |
|   Hostile toward God<br />与神为敌   |         |             |
|   Fleshly desires<br />肉体的私欲    |       |            |
|    Unable to submit to God<br />不能顺服神    |            |              |
|   Cannot please God<br />不能得神的喜悦    |              |             |
|     Only the Spirit working through the Word can bring them to faith<br />只有圣灵借着神的话做工才能让他们相信    |           |          |


Consider your attempts to share the gospel with unbelievers.  

思考你尝试与不信者分享福音的情形：

- How would keeping these characteristics in mind have made that a more positive experience?

- 记住这些特点可以怎样让你的分享经历变得更加积极?

- How would keeping those characteristics in mind have helped you to continue to love and befriend them?

- 记住这些特点可以怎样帮助你继续爱他们，继续与他们做朋友？

- How would knowing these characteristics have adjusted your expectations about the outcome of your witnessing?

- 知道这些特点后，你对他们听到福音后的反应做出的期待有了怎样的调整？

Consider this story: God instructed a man to push against a towering rock weighing many thousands of tons.  Day after day the man obeyed.  After ten years God said, “You’ve been pushing against this rock for a decade.  How does that make you feel?”  

“I feel frustrated and ashamed,” the man replied.” That rock hasn’t moved an inch.”  

“But, my son,” God said, “I didn’t ask you to move the rock.  I only asked you to push against it.”
	How is God’s command to us that we share the gospel with others similar to his command that this man push against that huge stone?  

思考这个故事：神指示一个人去推一个上万吨的大石头。几天之后，这个人答应去推了。十年后，神问他说：“你推这个大石头已经有十年的时间了，你感觉怎么样？”

“我感到既沮丧又羞耻，”那个人说：“那个石头连一寸都没动。”

神说：“孩子啊，可是我并没有让你去移动它，我只是叫你去推它！”神命令我们去给人传福音的情形与那个人推大石头的情形有什么相似之处呢？

What additional thought do we find in 1 Corinthians 3:7-9, “Neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.  The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor. For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.”

我们在林前3:7-9节中还能发现什么想法呢？“

3:7	可见栽种的算不得什么，浇灌的也算不得什么，只在那叫他生长的 神。3:8	栽种的和浇灌的，都是一样。但将来各人要照自己的工夫得自己的赏赐。3:9	因为我们是与　神同工的；你们是　神所耕种的田地，所建造的房屋。

Now that we have reviewed the characteristics of an unbeliever, how will you adjust your approach to continuing to witness to your grace friend?

我们既然已经复习了不信者的特点，你在继续给你的恩典朋友传福音时应该怎样调整你的方法？
