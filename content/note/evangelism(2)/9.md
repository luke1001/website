Below are a number of reasons Christians use to excuse themselves from sharing the gospel with others.

下面是基督徒找借口不与人分享福音的理由，

[  The basis for these items are suggested by Thom S. Rainer, CEO of LifeWay Christian Resources. 这些事项的最初提出者是托马斯S 瑞呐。生命道路基督徒资源网http://thomrainer.com/2015/03/obstacles-evangelism-local-church-rainer-leadership-108/] 

On a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), how much does each statement apply to you?

从1 （一点也不适合）到5（非常适合）排列。请给每句话打分，看看每句话与你的吻合度怎样？

_____ Christians have no sense of urgency to reach lost people.

_____ 基督徒对拯救失丧人群没有迫切感。

It’s clear that without a faith relationship with Jesus, no one can be saved. Acts 4:12 insists, “Salvation is found in no one else [except Jesus], for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.” Why would Christians fail to have a sense of urgency to help others escape hell?  

很明显，人与耶稣之间如果没有信心的联络，就没有一个人能得到拯救。徒4:12说：“除他[耶稣]以外，别无拯救；因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。”为什么基督徒对帮助他人逃避地狱没有迫切感？
_____ Many Christians and church members do not befriend and spend time with lost persons.What factors prohibit Christians from befriending people who are not Christians? 

_____ 很多基督徒和教会成员都不主动与失丧者交朋友，花时间与他们相处。是什么因素阻止基督徒与非基督徒交朋友？

_____ We are more known for what we are against than what we are for.

_____ 人们对我们的认识是：我们是反对什么的人，而不是支持什么的人。

Bible-believing Christians view homosexuality, abortion, divorce, sex outside of marriage, and many other activities our culture considers proper to be sinful because God’s Word says they are sins.  How do these counter-cultural values set up barriers to our witnessing?  What can we do to minimize those barriers?

相信圣经的基督徒视同性恋、堕胎、离婚、婚外情以及我们文化认为合适的很多活动为犯罪，因为圣经的话说它们是犯罪。这些与我们文化相悖的价值观怎样给我们的见证筑起了一道障碍？我们怎样才能让这些障碍的阻力最小化？

_____ Many church members think that evangelism is the role of the pastor and paid staff.

_____ 很多教会成员认为，传福音是牧师和教会领薪水人员的责任。

Because Jesus commands all of his disciples to “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19,20), the Savior made it clear that personal evangelism is every believer’s responsibility and privilege. How do we overcome this barrier?  Is there another, more compelling reason that Christians would want to pass off their witnessing to their pastor and other church leaders?

因为耶稣命令他所有的门徒“你们要去使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作“给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名）。	凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。” (太28:19-20)救主清楚地说，个人传福音是每一个信徒的责任和特权。我们怎样克服这个障碍呢？有没有一个更有力的理由让基督徒愿意不再把传福音的责任推给牧师和其他教会领袖？

_____ Political correctness is too commonplace even among Christians. We are frightened to 
share our faith because we might be persecuted or simply lose friends.

_____ 政治正确（中立语言）在基督徒中间也过于普遍。我们害怕分享我们的信仰，因为我们害怕被逼迫或者失去朋友。

Jesus warns, “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it” (Matthew 10:37-39). Nonetheless, we Christians may hide from opportunities to share Jesus with others out of fear of personal consequences.  Give some examples. 

耶稣警告说：“爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；爱儿女过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；不背着他的十字架跟从我的，也不配作我的门徒。得着生命的，将要失丧生命；为我失丧生命的，将要得着生命。” （太10:37-39）	尽管如此，我们基督徒却可能因为害怕给个人带来负面后果而躲避与人分享耶稣的机会。举一些例子。

_____ Our churches have too many activities; Christians are too busy to do the things that really matter. In addition, Christians in our culture are too busy; their priorities don’t leave room for caring enough about others to witness to them.

_____ 我们教会的活动太多；基督徒太忙，没有时间去做那些真正重要的事情。另外，我们文化中的基督徒太忙了，他们优先要做的事情太多，对其他人的在乎程度不足以让他们愿意花时间去向他们作见证。

How do Jesus words in Matthew 6:33, help us address our faulty priorities? “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”  What do you need to do in order to live out priorities that honor God better?

马太福音6:33节中耶稣的话怎样帮助我们处理自己的错误次序？“你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。”（太6:33）你需要做什么才能活出更能荣耀神的优先次序？

Did you notice that these personal barriers to sharing our faith with others are all ways we stand outside of what the Spirit calls and equips us to do?  Consequently, overcoming these barriers begins with recognizing that they are not God pleasing excuses for telling others about Jesus. That will lead us to admit the sin involved in hiding behind these barriers, to claiming our Jesus-won forgiveness, and to joyfully recommit to share the gospel out of gratitude for God’s grace. Let’s take time now to confess those sins and then to claim God’s assurance of forgiveness for those sins.

你是否注意到，我们与人分享信仰时遇到的这些个人障碍，都在圣灵呼召并装备我们去做的事情之外？因此，要想克服这些障碍，就要首先认识到，神不喜欢我们找借口。然后我们要认识到躲藏在这些障碍背后的罪，并宣告耶稣已经为我们赢得了赦免，而且出于对神恩典的感谢，我们可以欢喜地重新开始分享福音的工作。让我们花时间来承认那些罪，然后宣告神已经真正饶恕了那些罪。

Although we have identified some barriers to personally sharing Jesus with others, admitted the sin, and received forgiveness, there is another important step to take. That step is to identify where to find motivation powerful enough to overcome those barriers in the future. 2 Corinthians 5:14-21 connects us to that motivation. What is it?  Take a moment as a class to rejoice in that motivation.

尽管我们已经找出个人与他人分享耶稣的一些障碍，承认了我们的罪，也接受了饶恕，但还有一个重要的步骤要做，就是去哪里找一个足够强大的动力，使我们能够克服以后再次出现的障碍？林后5:14-21告诉我们那种动力的来源。是什么呢？我们花一点时间让全班同学都来为那个动力欢呼吧！

For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

林后5:14-21

5:14	原来基督的爱激励我们。因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了；
5:15	并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。
5:16	所以，我们从今以后，不凭着外貌（原文作“肉体”。本节同）认人了，虽然凭着外貌认过基督，如今却不再这样认他了。
5:17	若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人，旧事已过，都变成新的了。
5:18	一切都是出于神，他藉着基督使我们与他和好，又将劝人与他和好的职分赐给我们。
5:19	这就是神在基督里叫世人与自己和好，不将他们的过犯归到他们身上，并且将这和好的道理托付了我们。
5:20	所以，我们作基督的使者，就好像神藉我们劝你们一般。我们替基督求你们与神和好。
5:21	神使那无罪的（“无罪”原文作“不知罪”），替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。
