A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control （Proverbs 29:11）。

愚 妄 人 怒 气 全 发 ; 智 慧 人 忍 气 含 怒 . （箴言29:11）

**Meet Tom 汤姆的故事**

 Tom was an accountant for the Sheriffs dept. He had a wife, daughter, and two sons. Like so many in this country, Tom's family was very active in the church for many, many years until everything changed – Tom was asked to lead his Christian congregation through the long, tedious process of building a church. It's a job that Tom cheerfully accepted from his congregation, but a job that would forever change his life and his family's life, too. By the time the church had completed its building project, they had successfully driven Tom and many other families away from the house of God that they had hoped would bring people closer to God!

汤姆是司法部门的会计。他有妻子，女儿和两儿子。就像大多数的家庭一样，汤姆一家很多年积极参加教会，直到生活中每件事都发生改变——教会要汤姆领导信徒建一座教堂，这要经历长时间乏味的工程。汤姆高兴地接受了这个工作，但这个工作也永远改变了他和家人的生活。当教堂修建完工时，汤姆和很多其他家庭离开了神的家，教会原本希望建教堂能把人带到神面前！

Many people hated the design, and the result was that Tom became their scapegoat. Tom never would step foot inside of that church ever again, neither would his family. Unfortunately, the matter was much worse than that. Tom would spend the next 30 years of his life, pouting and lamenting about how poorly he was treated in a Christian church. Tom's wife would soon join another Christian church, as would the children, but Tom would not have anything to do with church for a long time, 30 years to be exact!

很多人讨厌教堂的设计，结果汤姆成了替罪羊，他再不会走进那个教堂，他们一家都不会。不幸的是，情况比这更糟。汤姆将在以后30年为在教会所受的遭遇而生气和悲伤。汤姆的妻子和孩子们很快参加了另一个教会，但是汤姆很长时间都不会理睬教会，确切地说30 年。

Tom's wife prayed for those 30 years that her husband's anger might be healed and that he would come back to the church and seek God's love and mercy from Word and sacrament as they once did as a family.

汤姆的妻子祷告了30年，希望她的丈夫的愤怒能得神医治，他能回到教会 ,像以前一样一家从神的话语和圣礼中寻求神的爱和怜悯。

After 30 years, her prayer was answered. Tom's wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer that would eventually take her life. While she was in the midst of dying she expressed to her husband her one and only dying wish. Can you guess what her wish was? Her one hope was that her husband would put aside his anger and return to the Lord's house. Shortly before she died, her prayer was answered.

30年后，她的祷告得到回应。汤姆的妻子诊断出晚期癌症，将最终失去生命。在她病危时，她向丈夫表达唯一一个遗愿。你能猜出她的遗愿是什么吗？她希望丈夫能息怒并回到神的家中。在她去世后不久，她的祷告得到回应。

For the next 5 years （Tom died at 84）， Tom did not miss a week at church. Every other Friday, Tom took me out for Catfish and the two of us would just talk, mostly about his wife and children, but also we would talk about the lost years of his life that he very much regretted.

在以后的15年里（汤姆84岁去世），汤姆每周去教会。每隔一周的周五，汤姆带我去钓鲶鱼，我们俩大多时候谈论她的妻子和孩子，我们也谈论令他非常后悔的在他生命中迷失神的日子。

The picture of the church up above became the source of great anger and hostility amongst people who profess to be known by the whole world because of their “love” for each other. Anger is one of those root sins, like greed, that can lead to many other great sins in a person's life. Today, we will look closer at how we can counsel others who might be stuck like Tom in the sin of their own anger. May God bless our study.

上面教堂的照片在那些被世人因为他们彼此“相爱”而闻名的人中间成了他们愤怒和敌视的对象 .愤怒是他们罪的根源，就像贪婪会在人的生命中导致很多其他的罪行。今天，我们近一步思考怎样帮助其他像汤姆一样困在愤怒中的人。求神祝福我们的学习。

 Apply Tom's situation with the following passages from the Bible…
 
 将汤姆的情况应用于以下圣经经文。。。
 
 ![](/images/note/jmx/4-2.jpg#right)

Psalm 37:8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret-it leads only to evil

当 止 住 怒 气 , 离 弃 忿 怒 ; 不 要 心 怀 不 平 , 以 致 作 恶 .

1. How had Tom's anger led to evil?

    Proverbs 12:18 Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

    箴言12:18说 话 浮 躁 的 , 如 刀 刺 人 ; 智 慧 人 的 舌 头 却 为 医 人 的 良 药 .

2. How had the “reckless words” of some of the church members at Tom's church “pierced like a sword?”

    汤姆教会成员的鲁莽的话为什么“如 刀 刺 人”?

    1 Corinthians 4:12 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it.

    哥林多前书4:12 并 且 劳 苦 , 亲 手 做 工 . 被 人 咒 骂 , 我 们 就 祝 福 ; 被 人 逼 迫 , 我 们 就 忍 受 ;

3. What advice from Paul might we give a church member who might be filled with anger at another member or even at their pastor?

    一个心里对其他教会成员，甚至牧师，感到愤怒的基督徒，我们可以给他保罗的什么建议？

    Application: Christians ought to look at strife in the congregation as an opportunity to put Christ-like love on display, as we are called by Jesus to love each other deeply. This command must reach far beyond those who love us back, but must also include those who aren't being very kind to us.

    应用：基督徒应该视教会中的冲突为彰显基督般的爱的机会，因为我们 被耶稣呼召彼此相爱。这一诫命的界限应该超越不仅去爱 那些回报我们爱的人，而且应该包括那些现在对我们并不友善的人。

    **Problems can be opportunities for growth in faith 困难可以成为信心成长的机会**

    The church, that is the body of believers, is merely an extension of the home. And just like every home has dissension and anger in it, so too, every church experiences hard feelings and sometimes anger for doing things differently than we might do them. Consider our Lord's advice, however, before we jump to conclusions about another person's actions or inactions…

    教会，是信徒组成的肢体，就是一个家庭的延伸。正如每个家庭都有纠纷和愤怒时刻，因此当信徒做的事情和教会不同时，每个教会都会感到困难和愤怒。然而，在我们对他人的行动或无所行动下结论之前请考虑主的忠告…

    Matthew 7:3-5 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

    马太7:3-5为 甚 麽 看 见 你 弟 兄 眼 中 有 刺 , 却 不 想 自 己 眼 中 有 梁 木 呢 ? 4你 自 己 眼 中 有 梁 木 , 怎 能 对 你 弟 兄 说 : 容 我 去 掉 你 眼 中 的 刺 呢 ? 5你 这 假 冒 为 善 的 人 ! 先 去 掉 自 己 眼 中 的 梁 木 , 然 後 才 能 看 得 清 楚 , 去 掉 你 弟 兄 眼 中 的 刺 .

4. Churches rarely disagree on doctrine, but often disagree on what might be considered matters of indifference or what the church calls adiaphora – something that is neither commanded nor forbidden by God. When dealing with non-doctrinal issues in the church, what advice does Jesus give to us as we deal with our brothers and sisters in the Lord?

    教会很少在教义上产生分歧，但经常在那些可能无所谓的事情上，或是教会称之为 adiaphora——即神既没有命令也没有禁止的事情上产生分歧。在处理教会非教义的问题时，耶稣关于我们对待主里的弟兄姐妹方面给我们什么忠告？

    Romans 5:3-4 Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.

    罗马书5:3-4 不 但 如 此 , 就 是 在 患 难 中 也 是 欢 欢 喜 喜 的 ; 因 为 知 道 患 难 生 忍 耐 , 4忍 耐 生 老 练 , 老 练 生 盼 望 ; 5盼 望 不 至 於 羞 耻 , 因 为 所 赐 给 我 们 的 圣 灵 将 神 的 爱 浇 灌 在 我 们 心 里 .

5. How will a mature Christian look at strife in his life, whether it comes to him/her at work, at home or even in his home church?

    一个成熟的基督徒怎样看待他生命中的冲突，无论冲突来自于他/她的工作，家庭或是他的家庭教会？

    2 Corinthians 12:10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

    哥林多后书12:10我 为 基 督 的 缘 故 , 就 以 软 弱 、 凌 辱 、 急 难 、 逼 迫 、 困 苦 为 可 喜 乐 的 ; 因 我 甚 麽 时 候 软 弱 , 甚 麽 时 候 就 刚 强 了 .

6. When Paul encountered anger and resentment, as he did from some of the Christians in Corinth who were calling to question his apostolic authority, how did he handle the situation?

    当保罗面对愤怒和怨恨时，当哥林多教会的某些信徒质疑他的使徒权柄时，他怎样处理这个局面？

    **Jesus loved his enemies 耶稣爱仇敌**

     ![](/images/note/jmx/4-3.jpg#right)


    Luke 13:34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!

    路加13:34耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ! 耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ! 你 常 杀 害 先 知 , 又 用 石 头 打 死 那 奉 差 遣 到 你 这 里 来 的 人 . 我 多 次 愿 意 聚 集 你 的 儿 女 , 好 像 母 鸡 把 小 鸡 聚 集 在 翅 膀 底 下 , 只 是 你 们 不 愿 意 .

    Luke 6:27,28 But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.

    路加6:27,28只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 这 听 道 的 人 , 你 们 的 仇 敌 , 要 爱 他 ! 恨 你 们 的 , 要 待 他 好 ! 28咒 诅 你 们 的 , 要 为 他 祝 福 ! 凌 辱 你 们 的 , 要 为 他 祷 告 !

    Application: A pastor or Christian leader of Jesus' church may be justifiably angry at the behavior of the sheep, however, it must not affect the love that he has for those sheep to corral them back into the fold where they might be fed with God's Word and sacrament once again

    应用：一位牧师或教会领袖有理由对带领的羊群的行为表示愤怒，然而，不能影响他对羊群的爱，把他们赶回羊圈，从而让神的话语再次喂养他们，让他们接受圣礼

    2 Timothy 2:24 And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.

    提摩太后书2:24然 而 主 的 仆 人 不 可 争 竞 , 只 要 温 温 和 和 的 待 众 人 , 善 於 教 导 , 存 心 忍 耐。

    Application: A Christian leader in God's house, might rightfully be considered a diplomat or mediator. It's important that he/she doesn't become the cause of dissension in a church, but rather a good resource to put out potential fires, continually reminding God's sheep to go back to the cross and remember that our Savior's love compels us to express love for each other even when we might disagree.

    应用：一个在神殿中的基督徒领袖 ,可以被当做一个大使或调解者。很重要的一点是：他/她不能引起教会纷争，而要成为熄灭潜在的怒火的源泉，不断提醒神的羊群回到十字架前，铭记即使我们意见不一，但我们救主的爱促使我们彼此相爱。

    Ephesians 4:29-32 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

    以弗所书4:29-32污 秽 的 言 语 一 句 不 可 出 口 , 只 要 随 事 说 造 就 人 的 好 话 , 叫 听 见 的 人 得 益 处 . 30不 要 叫 神 的 圣 灵 担 忧 ; 你 们 原 是 受 了 他 的 印 记 , 等 候 得 赎 的 日 子 来 到 . 31一 切 苦 毒 、 恼 恨 、 忿 怒 、 嚷 闹 、 毁 谤 , 并 一 切 的 恶 毒 （ 或 作 : 阴 毒 ） , 都 当 从 你 们 中 间 除 掉 ; 32并 要 以 恩 慈 相 待 , 存 怜 悯 的 心 , 彼 此 饶 恕 , 正 如 神 在 基 督 里 饶 恕 了 你 们 一 样 .

    Application: If we aren't building up our brothers and sisters in Christ, then it can be rightly said that we're probably tearing them down. When Christians congregate with each other, whether it be weekly, monthly or whenever, it's important we see each opportunity to encourage each other in our faith.

    应用：如果我们不在基督里团结弟兄姐妹，可以说我们大概是在拆散他们。当信徒聚集一起时，无论是按周，月，进行团契，还是其他什么时候 ,重要的是我们有机会在信心上彼此鼓励。

**Meet Corrie ten Boom Corrie ten Boom的故事**

 ![](/images/note/jmx/4-4.jpg#right)
 
 Corrie ten Boom was a former prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. She describes the feelings she had as she met face-to-face one of the former guards of the camp.

Corrie ten Boom曾是纳粹集中营的犯人。她描述了当她与集中营的一个卫兵面对面见面时的感受。

”It was in a church in Munich that I saw him, a balding heavy-set man in a gray overcoat, a brown felt hat clutched between his hands. People were filing out of the basement room where I had just spoken, moving along the rows of wooden chairs to the door at the rear. It was 1947, and I had come from Holland to defeated Germany with the message that God forgives.

“我在慕尼黑的一个教堂看见他，严重秃顶，身穿灰色大衣，手拿一顶褐色毡帽。当时人们正从我发表讲话的地下室鱼贯而出，沿着一排木椅走向后门。这是1947年，我带着神的信息已从荷兰回到了战败的德国

It was the truth they needed most to hear in that bitter, bombed-out land, and I gave them my favorite mental picture. Maybe because the sea is never far from a Hollander's mind, I liked to think that that's where forgiven sins were thrown. 'When we confess our sins,' I said, 'God casts them into the deepest ocean, gone forever.'

这是他们最需要听到的在那片痛苦的，遭到轰炸的土地上的真相。我告诉他们我最喜欢的脑海中的画面。也许是因为大海从未远离一个荷兰人的头脑，我总觉得人的罪被宽恕后被神扔在那里。”当我们承认自己的罪时“我说，”神把他们扔进大海的最深处，永远消失掉。“

The solemn faces stared back at me, not quite daring to believe. There were never questions after talks in Germany in 1947. People stood up in silence, in silence collected their wraps, and in silence left the room.

这些严肃的面孔凝视着我，几乎不敢相信事实。讲完1947年的德国后从没有人提问。人们安静地站着，安静地拿起披肩，安静地离开房间。

And that's when I saw him, working his way forward against the others. One moment I saw the overcoat and the brown hat; the next, a blue uniform and a visored cap with its skull and crossbones. It came back with a rush: the huge room with its harsh overhead lights, the pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center of the floor, the shame of walking naked past this man. I could see my sister's frail form ahead of me, ribs sharp beneath the parchment skin. Betsie, how thin you were!

然而，就在我看着他从人群反方向走来时。一会我眼前看见的是大衣和褐色帽子，下一刻却是蓝色制服和印着骷髅和交叉的骨头的头盔。记忆猛地回来了：巨大的房间和头上的强光，地板中间悲惨地堆着衣服和鞋，羞辱地裸露身体经过这个男人。我看见虚弱的姐姐在我前面，瘦得皮包骨头。Betsie, 你瘦成了这样！

Betsie and I had been arrested for concealing Jews in our home during the Nazi occupation of Holland; this man had been a guard at Ravensbruck concentration camp where we were sent.

Betsie和我在纳粹占领荷兰期间因为隐藏犹太人被捕；这个男人在我们被关押的Ravensbruck 集中营当卫兵。

Now he was in front of me, hand thrust out: 'A fine message, Fraulein! How good it is to know that, as you say, all our sins are at the bottom of the sea!'

现在他就在我面前，向我伸出手：多好的信息，小姐！就像你说的，我们的罪都在海底！知道这个，太好了！

And I, who had spoken so glibly of forgiveness, fumbled in my pocketbook rather than take that hand. He would not remember me, of course – how could he remember one prisoner among those thousands of women?

而我，刚才流畅地讲到宽恕，现在手却在手袋里摸索着，并没有去握他的手。他不会记得我，当然——他怎能记得那些数千名妇女中的一个犯人呢？

But I remembered him and the leather crop swinging from his belt. It was the first time since my release that I had been face to face with one of my captors and my blood seemed to freeze.

但是我记得他和他皮带上晃悠的皮鞭。这是我被释放后第一次与抓我的人面对面，我的血液似乎凝固了。

'You mentioned Ravensbruck in your talk,' he was saying. 'I was a guard in there.' No, he did not remember me.

”你谈话中提到Ravensbruck“,他说。”我是那的卫兵。“不，他不记得我了。

'But since that time,' he went on, 'I have become a Christian. I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things I did there, but I would like to hear it from your lips as well. Fraulein' – again the hand came out – 'will you forgive me?'

”但从那以后，“他继续说，”我成了基督徒。我知道神已经宽恕了我所做的残酷的事情，但我也愿意从您的嘴里听到这个信息。“小姐”——他再次伸出手来——“您能宽恕我吗？”

And I stood there – I whose sins had every day to be forgiven – and could not. Betsie had died in that place – could he erase her slow terrible death simply for the asking?

我站在那——我的罪每天得到神的宽恕——而我现在却做不到宽恕他。Betsie 在那里死去——他仅仅要求宽恕就能抹掉她经历的缓慢可怕的死亡过程吗？

1. From the perspective of Corrie ten Boom, how can you relate to her feelings on perhaps a much smaller scale （maybe not）？

    根据Corrie ten Boom的观点，你怎样对她的感受产生共鸣，也许只是一小点共鸣而已（也许没有）？

2. From the perspective of the guard, how can you relate with his need to hear it again from her lips that he was forgiven for his actions?

    根据这个士兵的观点，您怎样理解他为何需要再次从她的嘴里听到自己的行为得到宽恕的信息？

3. What was Corrie ten Boom compelled to do as a Christian? （Read the following）

    作为一个基督徒，Corrie ten Boom 有责任做什么？（阅读以下经文）

    Matthew 5:21-24 You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, “Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.” But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment … first go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.

    马太5:21-24 你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说，不可杀人，又说，凡杀人的，难免受审判。只是我告诉你们，凡向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判。（有古卷在凡字下添无缘无故地五字）凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断。凡骂弟兄是魔利的，难免地狱的火。所以你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨，就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。


    Romans 12:17-21 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

    罗马书12:17-21
    
    17不 要 以 恶 报 恶 ; 众 人 以 为 美 的 事 要 留 心 去 做 . 18若 是 能 行 , 总 要 尽 力 与 众 人 和 睦 . 19亲 爱 的 弟 兄 , 不 要 自 己 伸 冤 , 宁 可 让 步 , 听 凭 主 怒 （ 或 作 : 让 人 发 怒 ） ; 因 为 经 上 记 着 : 主 说 : 伸 冤 在 我 ; 我 必 报 应 . 20所 以 , 你 的 仇 敌 若 饿 了 , 就 给 他 吃 , 若 渴 了 , 就 给 他 喝 ; 因 为 你 这 样 行 就 是 把 炭 火 堆 在 他 的 头 上 . 21你 不 可 为 恶 所 胜 , 反 要 以 善 胜 恶 .

4. How might Corrie's decision to forgive or not to forgive this guard, affect her relationship with…

    Corrie选择宽恕或不宽恕这个士兵的决定如何影响她与…的关系

    a. God?

    神

    b. Herself?

    她自己

    c. The former guard?

    卫兵

    Let's see how Corrie responded:

    让我们看看Corrie怎样回应：

    “It could not have been many seconds that he stood there, hand held out, but to me it seemed hours as I wrestled with the most difficult thing I had ever had to do.

    ”对他来说站在那里，伸出手可能并没有多长时间，但对我来说像是几个小时，我在和从未有过的最困难的事情挣扎。

    For I had to do it – I knew that. The message that God forgives also means that if we are willing to accept his forgiveness for our grievous sins, then we also will forgive our debtors on behalf of Christ. For Jesus himself says, 'If you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses.'

    我不得不做——我知道。神宽恕我们也意味着如果我们愿意接受他对我们可怕的罪的宽恕，那么我们也要代表他宽恕欠我们债的人。因为耶稣自己说，“如果你不饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也比不饶恕你们的过犯。”

    I knew it not only as a commandment of God, but as a daily experience. Since the end of the war I had had a home in Holland for victims of Nazi brutality. Those who were able to forgive their former enemies were able also to return to the outside world and rebuild their lives, no matter what the physical scars. Those who nursed bitterness remained invalids. It was as simple and as horrible as that.

    我知道这不只是神的诫命，而是一个日常的体验。自从战争结束，我在荷兰有个遭受纳粹暴行的受害者之家。那些能饶恕他们以前的敌人的人能够回到外界，重建新生活，无论有什么生理伤疤。而那些对于苦楚不能释怀的仍旧病弱。就是这样即简单又可怕的经历。

    And still I stood there with the coldness clutching my heart. But forgiveness is not an emotion – I knew that too. Forgiveness is an act of the will, and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart. 'Jesus, help me!' I prayed silently. 'I can lift my hand. I can do that much. You supply the feeling.'

    我仍然站在那里，内心冰凉。但宽恕不只是一种情感——我了解这点。宽恕是一种意志的执行，这种意志能不顾心灵的温度。“耶稣，请帮助我！”我默默祷告。“我可以伸手，我只能做到这样。求您托住我。”

    And so woodenly, mechanically, I thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me. And as I did, an incredible thing took place. The current started in my shoulder, raced down my arm, sprang into our joined hands. And then this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being, bringing tears to my eyes. 'I forgive you, brother!' I cried. 'With all my heart!'

    我笨拙，机械地把手伸给这个向我伸手的人。我这么做时，不可思议的事发生了。一股电流从我的肩膀开始，穿过手臂，涌进我们握在一起的手中。然后神医治的暖流淹没我整个人，泪水夺眶而出。“我宽恕你了，弟兄”我喊道。 “ 全身心的宽恕！”

    For a long moment we grasped each other's hands, the former guard and the former prisoner. I had never known God's love so intensely as I did then.

    我们很长时间握住彼此的手，曾经一个是卫兵，一个是犯人。 我从未如此强烈地感受神的爱。

5. What did Corrie ten Boom give up, when she chose to forgive the former guard?

    当Corrie ten Boom 选择宽恕那个卫兵时，她放弃了什么？

6. Consider the following things that often hang us up from forgiving and explain how Corrie set those aside:

    考虑以下经常阻碍我们宽恕别人的因素，并解释Corrie怎样把这些因素搁置一旁：

    a. Pride

    骄傲

    b. Vengeance

    复仇

    c. Self-esteem.

    自尊

Application: God's forgiveness can seem unfair sometimes, especially when you consider the thief on the cross, and the parable of the talents. Jesus paid the man who worked only one hour the same amount of talents as the man who labored all day and the one who worked all day felt a bit ripped off. I think we are inclined to feel that same way as workers in God's house at times. That's why it's so important to look at life as one big opportunity for each of us to imitate, in a small way, the love our Savior showed us when he died for sinners like us.

应用：神的宽恕有时看起来不公平，尤其当你想到十字架上的贼和 才干的比喻时。耶稣付给只做一个小时活的人和干了一天活的人同样的报酬 .干了一天活的人感到被剥削了。 我想我们为神做工有时有同样的感觉。这就是为什么很重要的一点是要把生命看做我们能以微小的方式来效仿我们救主的爱，因他为我们这些罪人而死。

1 Peter 3:9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.

彼得前书3:9不 以 恶 报 恶 , 以 辱 骂 还 辱 骂 , 倒 要 祝 福 ; 因 你 们 是 为 此 蒙 召 , 好 叫 你 们 承 受 福 气 .
