第二十一课：创世纪1-2章 创世
Genesis 1-2 The Creation
创世纪1-2章 创世
The Bible always assumes, and never argues God’s existence. Although everything else had a beginning, God has always been. We are introduced to the God of unlimited power and majesty and the author of all things and all living beings in Genesis. This is the history of the creation of the world.
圣经常以上帝的存在为前提，且在这一点上从不质疑。尽管每件事都有起源，上帝却是永远长存。在圣经创世纪里向我们启示那具有无限的权能和威严又创造万事万物的神。这是创世的历史。
Chapter 1
第一章
(1) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (2) Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. What has been created? (3) And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. How was the light created? (4) God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. (5) God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning – the first day.
(1)起初 神创造天地。(2)地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗；神的灵运行在水面上。是什么被造了？(3)神说：“要有光。”就有了光。光是怎样被造的？(4)神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。(5)神称光为“昼”，称暗为“夜”。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。

(6) And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.” (7)So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. (8) God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning – the second day. It seems that there was a canopy of water that was above the sky and water below, on the land.
(6)神说：“诸水之间要有空气，将水分为上下。”(7)神就造出空气，将空气以下的水、空气以上的水分开了。事就这样成了。(8)神称空气为“天”。有晚上，有早晨，是第二日。在这里可能是说有水高于天上的穹苍，同样在其下也有地上的水。
(9) And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. (10) God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. (11) Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. (12) The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. (13) And there was evening, and there was morning – the third day.
(9)神说：“天下的水要聚在一处，使旱地露出来。”事就这样成了。(10)神称旱地为“地”，称水的聚处为“海”。 神看着是好的。(11)神说：“地要发生青草和结种子的菜蔬，并结果子的树木，各从其类，果子都包着核。”事就这样成了。(12)于是地发生了青草和结种子的菜蔬，各从其类；并结果子的树木，各从其类；果子都包着核。 神看着是好的。(13)有晚上，有早晨，是第三日。

(14) And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. (17) God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, (18) to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. (19) And there was evening, and there was morning – the fourth day. What are some similarities with the other days of creation?
(14)神说：“天上要有光体，可以分昼夜、作记号、定节令、日子、年岁；(15)并要发光在天空，普照在地上。”事就这样成了。(16)于是 神造了两个大光：大的管昼，小的管夜。又造众星。(17)就把这些光摆列在天空，普照在地上。(18)管理昼夜，分别明暗。 (19)神看着是好的。有晚上，有早晨，是第四日。与创造之工的其余几天有哪些相似之处？

(20) And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” (21) So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. (22) God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” (23) And there was evening, and there was morning – the fifth day.
How was the fifth day different from the other 4 days of creation?
(20) 神说：“水要多多滋生有生命的物，要有雀鸟飞在地面以上，天空之中。”(21)神就造出大鱼和水中所滋生各样有生命的动物，各从其类；又造出各样飞鸟，各从其类。 神看着是好的。(22)神就赐福给这一切，说：“滋生繁多，充满海中的水；雀鸟也要多生在地上。”(23)有晚上，有早晨，是第五日。创造之工的第五天与其它四天有什么不同？

(24) And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. (25) God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. We have heard “to their kinds” on days 3, 5, and 6. What does that mean?
(24) 神说：“地要生出活物来，各从其类；牲畜、昆虫、野兽，各从其类。”事就这样成了。(25)于是 神造出野兽，各从其类；牲畜，各从其类；地上一切昆虫，各从其类。 神看着是好的。在第3、4、6天我们都看到了“各从其类”，这是什么意思？

(26) Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, What does the word “our” tell us? and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” (27) So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. How would you describe the image of God? (28) God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.” Name the 3 ways they were blessed.
(26) 神说：“我们要照着我们的形象，按着我们的样式造人，使他们管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟、地上的牲畜和全地，并地上所爬的一切昆虫。” “我们”这个词告诉了我们什么信息？(27) 神就照着自己的形象造人，乃是照着祂的形象造男造女。你能想象上帝的形象是什么样的吗？ (28) 神就赐福给他们，又对他们说：“要生养众多，遍满地面，治理这地；也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟，和地上各样行动的活物。”请举出他们(人)所受的三样赐福

(29) Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. (30) Were Adam and Eve permitted to eat meat? And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground – everything that has the breath of life in it – I give every green plant for food.” Were animals suppose to eat meat? And it was so. (31) God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning – the sixth day.
(29) 神说：“看哪！我将遍地上一切结种子的菜蔬和一切树上所结有核的果子，全赐给你们作食物。神准许亚当和夏娃吃肉吗？(30) 至于地上的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并各样爬在地上有生命的物，我将青草赐给它们作食物。”动物们获准吃肉了吗？事就这样成了。 (31) 神看着一切所造的都甚好。有晚上，有早晨，是第六日。

Chapter 2
第二章
Chapter 2: 4-25 records additional information and facts regarding the creation of man.
第二章2：4-25节补充记述了关于上帝造人的更多事实和信息。
(1) Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. (2) By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. (3) And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
(1)天地万物都造齐了。(2)到第七日， 神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工，安息了。(3) 神赐福给第七日，定为圣日，因为在这日 神歇了他一切创造的工，就安息了。

(4) This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens – (5) and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, (6) but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground – (7) the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
(4)创造天地的来历，在耶和华 神造天地的日子，乃是这样。(5) 野地还没有草木，田间的菜蔬还没有长起来，因为耶和华 神还没有降雨在地上，也没有人耕地；(6) 但有雾气从地上腾，滋润遍地。(7) 耶和华 神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人，名叫亚当。

(8) Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. (9) And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground – trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (10) A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. (11) The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold (12) (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) (13) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. (14) The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. God gave Adam and Eve a place to live and to care for.
(8)耶和华 神在东方的伊甸立了一个园子，把所造的人安置在那里。(9) 耶和华 神使各样的树从地里长出来，可以悦人的眼目，其上的果子好作食物。园子当中又有生命树和分别善恶的树。 (10) 有河从伊甸流出来，滋润那园子，从那里分为四道：(11) 第一道名叫比逊，就是环绕哈腓拉全地的。在那里有金子，(12) 并且那地的金子是好的；在那里又有珍珠和红玛瑙。(13) 第二道河名叫基训，就是环绕古实全地的。(14)第三道河名叫希底结，流在亚述的东边。第四道河就是伯拉河。神给亚当和夏娃安置了住处来养活他们。

(15) The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. God gave man satisfying work. (16) And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; (17) but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die. Look at verse 9 – what special trees were in the garden? Read verse 17 – from what tree were they not to eat? What would happen if they were to eat it? Why would God put this tree in the garden?
(15) 耶和华 神将那人安置在伊甸园，使他修理看守。上帝给人以满意的工作(16) 耶和华 神吩咐他说：“园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃； (17) 只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死！”请看第9节—园中有怎样特别的树木？请读17节—是什么树上的果子不允许他们吃？如果他们吃了会怎样？上帝为什么要放置这棵树在园子里？

(18) The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. (19) Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. (20) So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field.
But for Adam no suitable helper was found. What did God want for man? (21) So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh. (22) Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. (23) The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman’, for she was taken out of man.” Why was Eve suitable for Adam?
(18)耶和华 神说：“那人独居不好，我要为他造一个配偶帮助他。” (19) 耶和华 神用土所造成的野地各样走兽，和空中各样飞鸟，都带到那人面前，看他叫什么。那人怎样叫各样的活物，那就是它的名字。(20) 那人便给一切牲畜和空中飞鸟、野地走兽都起了名；只是那人没有遇见配偶帮助他。神对男人有什么心意？(21)耶和华 神使他沉睡，他就睡了。于是取下他的一条肋骨，又把肉合起来。(22)耶和华 神就用那人身上所取的肋骨，造成一个女人，领她到那人跟前。(23)那人说：“这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，可以称她为‘女人’，因为她是从男人身上取出来的。”为什么夏娃和亚当很班配？

(24) For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. What is one flesh? (25) The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. What had God planned for man and woman?
(24) 因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。什么是“一体”？(25)当时夫妻二人，赤身露体，并不羞耻。神对男人和女人的旨意如何？

NOTES
He rested – This does not meant that God was tired, but rather that he stopped creating because it was done.
祂安息了－这里不是说上帝累了，而是祂因完成了创造而歇了(停止)创造的工作。
Breathed into his nostrils – This act made man superior to all other living beings. Man was given a soul and his life was one much higher than that of animals.
吹在他的鼻孔里－神这样做使人区别于所有其它的活物。人被赐予灵魂，这使得他的生命比一切动物都高贵。
Die – a separation from God, no longer like God.
死亡－与神的分离，不再像神。
