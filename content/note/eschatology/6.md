#### 6. The End Of The Universe 宇宙的终结

1 Corinthians 7:31b – For this world in its present form is passing away.

《哥林多前书》7：31b——因为这世界的样子将要过去了。

Psalm 102:25-26 – 25) In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. 26) They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them and they will be discarded.

《诗篇》102：25－26——你起初立了地的根基，天也是你手所造的。26天地都要灭没，你却要长存；天地都要如外衣渐渐旧了，你要将天地如里衣更换，天地就都改变了。

##### A. God reveals that the world and universe in which we currently live in will not continue forever. God will take the earth and space that He created and preserves and bring them to a definite end. 上帝启示我们当前生存的这个世界不会永远都存在。时候将到，上帝将终结他所创造与托住的地球和宇宙。

<br />
1 Peter 4:7a – The end of all things is near.

《彼得前书》4：7a万物的结局近了，

Matthew 24:29, 35a – 29) Immediately after the distress of those days “the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 35a) Heaven and earth will pass away.

《马太福音》24：29——“那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。35a天地要废去，”

2 Peter 3:7 – By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and the destruction of ungodly men.

《彼得后书》3：7——但现在的天地还是凭着那命存留，直留到不敬虔之人受审判遭沉沦的日子，用火焚烧。

##### B. At the time of Christ’s Second Coming and the Final Judgment, God will openly bring the world and the rest of creation to a sudden conclusion. 当基督二次再来与末日审判的时候，上帝会公开地给这个世界及其他所造之物一个突然的终结。

<br />
Isaiah 34:4 – All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree.

《以赛亚书》34：4——天上的万象都要消没，天被卷起，好像书卷；其上的万象要残败，像葡萄树的叶子残败，又像无花果树的叶子残败一样。

2 Peter 3:10, 12b-13 – 10) But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed in the fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. 12b) That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. 13) But in keeping with His promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.

《彼得后书》3：10——但主的日子要像贼来到一样，那日，天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化，地和其上的物都要烧尽了。12b－13在那日，天被火烧就销化了，有形质的都要被烈火熔化。13但我们照他的应许，盼望新天新地，有义居在其中。

##### C. God will destroy the universe with a tremendous, devastating fire. 上帝将会用巨大的烈火毁灭宇宙。

<br />
Revelation 20:11; 21:1 – 11) Then I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from His presence, and there was no place for them. . . . 2:1) Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.

《启示录》20:11; 21:1 

20:11我又看见一个白色的大宝座与坐在上面的，从他面前天地都逃避，再无可见之处了。

21：1我又看见一个新天新地，因为先前的天地已经过去了，海也不再有了。

##### D. Many Bible verses that speak about the end of the universe appear to indicate that God will burn up the universe completely and that nothing of it will remain. He will then create a new, perfect heavenly universe out of nothing where He will live with His believers and His holy angels forever. This is called the Annihilation view. 很多圣经提到宇宙终结的时候暗示，宇宙会被烈火熔化，一切都会销毁。上帝将会在天上创造一个新的、完美的宇宙，他将与信徒、众天使在那里同在，直到永远，这个观点被称为“宇宙毁灭论”。

<br />
Romans 8:20-22 – 20) For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the One who subjected it, in hope 21) that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. 22) We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.

《罗马书》8：20－22——因为受造之物服在虚空之下，不是自己愿意，乃是因那叫他如此的。21但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制，得享　神儿女自由的荣耀（“享”原文作“入”）。22我们知道一切受造之物一同叹息、劳苦，直到如今。

##### E. Some Bible verses that speak about the end of the world appear to indicate that God will melt the elements of the universe in fire and then use the remains to form a renewed, purified heavenly universe where He will live with His believers and His holy angels forever. This is called the Transformation or Reconstruction view. 圣经中有些经节提到宇宙终结的时候，似乎暗示上帝会用火来熔炼这个宇宙，用熔炼后的所剩之物制成一个焕然一新的、属天的纯洁的宇宙，他将与他的信徒和众天使同在，直到永远。这个观点被称为“宇宙转化论”或者“宇宙重建论”。

##### F. Since God does not state whether the present universe will be annihilated or transformed by means of His destructive fire with sufficient clarity, we treat this aspect of the end of the universe as an “open question.” In regards to open questions, people may have different views on a matter – as long as they do not conflict with clearly revealed Bible teaching – without those differences creating a division in their unity of faith in Christ and in their allegiance to the teachings of His Word. 上帝没有明确的说当前的世界是否会被消亡或者用烈火转化，因此我们对于把宇宙的终结看为“未解决的问题”。视为未解决的问题，人们可以对同一事物有不同的观点——只要他们与圣经的明确启示不冲突——只要他们的不同之处不足以对基督里的合一信心和他们对神话语教导上的忠诚产生分裂。

<br />
2 Peter 3:8-9 – 8) But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 9) The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

《彼得后书》3：8－9——亲爱的弟兄啊，有一件事你们不可忘记，就是主看一日如千年，千年如一日。9主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。

##### G. As people who live with the reality that God will end the universe, God calls us to be patient until that time and to understand that God allows the world to exist so that more people will have the opportunity to repent of their sins and be saved eternally through Jesus Christ. 作为明白上帝将要终结宇宙是个事实而活在世上的人们，上帝呼召我们要耐心地等待那个时期的来到，理解上帝允许这个世界的继续存在是要使更多的人能有机会悔改，藉着耶稣基督永远得救。


<br />
2 Peter 3:11-12a, 14-15 - 11) Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives 12) as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. 14) So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with Him. 15) Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation.

《彼得后书》3：11－12a，14-15

11 这一切既然都要如此销化，你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔，12切切仰望　神的日子来到。

14 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既盼望这些事，就当殷勤，使自己没有玷污，无可指摘，安然见主。15并且要以我主长久忍耐为得救的因由，就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗，照着所赐给他的智慧写了信给你们。

##### H. As people who live with the knowledge that God will end the universe, God calls us to live dedicated, holy, God-pleasing lives and to remain in believing union with Him. 作为知道上帝将要终结宇宙而活在世上的人们，上帝呼召我们过奉献、圣洁、蒙神喜悦的生活，保持信心与上帝联合。
