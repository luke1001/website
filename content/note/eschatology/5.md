##### C. God's holy angels will gather all people (godly and ungodly) for this judgment. 上帝的使者将会在审判的时候聚集所有的人（属神的人与不属神的人）。

<br />

《启示录》16：7b--是的，主　神，全能者啊，你的判断义哉，诚哉！"

Romans 3:23-24 – For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24) and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

John 3:17-18 – For God did not sent His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because He has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.

《约翰福音》3：17－18——因为　神差他的儿子降世，不是要定世人的罪（或作"审判世人"。下同），乃是要叫世人因他得救。

John 3:36 – Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.

《约翰福音》3：36信子的人有永生；不信子的人得不着永生（原文作"不得见永生"），　神的震怒常在他身上。"

##### D. Jesus Christ will carry out an honest and fair judgment. The basis of His judgment will be the Law and Gospel truths that God has revealed in His Word. 耶稣基督将要施行诚实公平的审判。他的审判依据上帝的道启示给我们律法与福音的真理。

    相信自己是蒙主耶稣基督所拯救的罪人的人，罪得赦免，避免了上帝的定罪，获得永生

2. Those who do not believe that they are sinners who are saved by Jesus Christ are condemned by God because they rejected their Savior and so must pay the penalty for their sins themselves and suffer eternal death.

<br /> 
Revelation 11:18b – The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding Your servants the prophets and Your saints and those who reverence Your name, both small and great.

《启示录》11：18——外邦发怒，你的忿怒也临到了，审判死人的时候也到了；你的仆人众先知和众圣徒，凡敬畏你名的人，连大带小得赏赐的时候也到了；你败坏那些败坏世界之人的时候也就到了。”

Revelation 20:12b – Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.

Matthew 25:32b-40 – 32) He (Christ) will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33) He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. 34) Then the King will say to those on His right, “Come, you who are blessed by My Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35) For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited Me in. 36) I needed clothes and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you came to visit Me.” 37) Then the righteous will answer Him, “Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? 38) When did we see You a stranger and invite You in, or needing clothes and clothe You? 39) When did we see You sick or in prison and go to visit You? 40) The King will reply, “I tell you the truth, whatever you did for on of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.”

《马太福音》25：32b－40——他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般；33把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。34于是，王要向那右边的说：‘你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。35因为我饿了，你们给我吃；渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；36我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。’37义人就回答说：‘主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，给你吃，渴了，给你喝？38什么时候见你作客旅，留你住，或是赤身露体，给你穿？39又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢？’40王要回答说：‘我实在告诉你们：这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。’

1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 – 16) For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17) After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.

《帖撒罗尼迦前书》4：16－17——16因为主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音和天使长的声音，又有　神的号吹响，那在基督里死了的人必先复活。17以后我们这活着还存留的人必和他们一同被提到云里，在空中与主相遇。这样，我们就要和主永远同在。

Matthew 13:43 – Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

##### E. On Judgment Day, the Lord Jesus Christ will grant great blessing to His believers. 当审判的日子，主耶稣基督赐予信徒极大的祝福。

1. The Lord will set the believers apart from unbelievers.

    主将信徒与非信徒分别开来。

    上帝会称赞信徒，追忆他们因信仰的缘故凭着爱与服侍所做的善工。

3. The Lord will not bring up the sins and failings of believers at the Final Judgment. Their sins have previously been dealt with and have been forgiven through the redeeming and justifying work of Jesus.

    在最后审判的时候，主不会提及基督徒的罪与软弱，他们先前的罪已经因信称义，藉着基督的救赎事工赦免了。

4. The Lord will have the resurrected and glorified believers join Him in the glories of eternal life in heaven.

    主会使复活了的荣耀的信徒进入他天国永远的荣耀生命中。

<br /> 
Matthew 12:36 – But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.

《马太福音》12：36——我又告诉你们：凡人所说的闲话，当审判的日子，必要句句供出来。

Matthew 10:33 – But whoever disowns Me before men, I will disown Him before My Father in heaven.

《马太福音》10：33--凡在人面前不认我的，我在我天上的父面前也必不认他。”

Matthew 25:32b-33, 41-46a - – 32) He (Christ) will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33) He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. 41) Then He will say to those on His left, “Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42) For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, 43) I was a stranger and you did not invite Me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me. 44) They also will answer, “Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help You?” 45) He will reply, “I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me. 46) Then they will go away to eternal punishment.

《马太福音》25：32b－33，41－46a

32他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般；33把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。

41－46a——王又要向那左边的说：‘你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！42因为我饿了，你们不给我吃；渴了，你们不给我喝；43我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。’44他们也要回答说：‘主啊，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢？’45王要回答说：‘我实在告诉你们：这些事你们既不作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不作在我身上了。’46这些人要往永刑里去……”

Matthew 13:41-42, 49-50 – 41) The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42) They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. . . . 49) This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous 50) and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

《马太福音》13：41－42——41人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，42丢在火炉里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。13：49－50——世界的末了也要这样。天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来，50丢在火炉里，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。”

Revelation 20:15 – If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

《启示录》20：15若有人名字没记在生命册上，他就被扔在火湖里。

##### F. On Judgment Day, the Lord Jesus Christ will announce terrible curses on all unbelievers. 当审判的日子，主耶稣基督会宣判可怕的咒诅对所有非信徒。

1. The unbelievers had rejected God and His salvation by rejecting Jesus. Now they will be rejected by God. Having refused God’s Gospel offer of “mercy without judgment”, they will face His Law consequence of “judgment without mercy.”

    非信徒因拒绝了耶稣而拒绝上帝和他的救恩，现在他们会被上帝拒绝。他们拒绝神的福音“没有审判的恩慈”，他们将面对上帝律法“没有恩慈的审判”。

2. The Lord will rebuke the unbelievers for their sins. He will point out how their unbelief showed itself in loveless neglect of people in need.

    因为，上帝将责备非信徒所犯的罪，他要指出他们的不信如何在冷漠对待需要帮助的人上表露无遗。

3. The Lord will sentence the resurrected and horrified unbelievers to depart from Him into the eternal punishments of hell.

    上帝将宣判这些复活的惊骇的非信徒，他们与上帝分离，进入到永罚的地狱中。

4. God’s holy angels will throw the condemned unbelievers into hell.

    上帝的使者会将非信徒抛在永罚的地狱中。


<br /> 
##### G. Comparing the Final Judgment with the divine judgment a person faces at the time of his/her death. 对比末日审判与一个人临终前面临的神圣审判。

1. The day a person dies, his/her eternal destiny is decided. The person’s soul is judged by God privately. A believing soul goes to heaven. An unbelieving soul goes to hell.

    当一个人死亡的时候，他永远的命运已经决定。他的灵魂由上帝私下掌管。信徒的灵魂上天堂，不信的灵魂下地狱。

2. At the Final Judgment, after the resurrection of the dead, the judgment God made at the time of death is not changed, but it is now made public.

    末日审判的时候，人们从死里复活，每个人临死时的审判不变，但现在被公开。

3. The personal judgment made at the time of death involved a person’s soul. The Final Judgment deals with both a person’s body and soul.

    临死时的个人审判只针对他的灵魂。末日审判既针对他的灵魂，也针对他的肉体。

4. At the Final Judgment, those who are alive at Christ’s Second Coming are judged in both body and soul without having to go through a personal judgment at the time of physical death.

    最终审判的时候，那些活到耶稣二次再来的人，他们的肉体与灵魂直接接受审判，不需要经历临死前的个人审判。

    当耶稣提到基督徒的善行成为他们得到永生祝福的理由（《约翰福音》5：28－29；《马太福音》25：34－40）时，，耶稣岂不是在混淆，甚至违背圣经对于救恩的教导是神恩典的礼物（以弗所书2：8－9）吗？
