3. In their sinful folly and spiritual arrogance, many people have made incorrect guesses and false predictions about the time of Christ’s return.

    由于人们罪里的愚蠢与灵里的傲慢，很多人对基督的再来做出了不正确的猜测，以及虚假的预言。

<br />
Matthew 24:3-14 – 3) As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?” 4) Jesus answered, “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5) For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. 6) You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7) Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8) All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9) Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of Me. 10) At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11) and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12) Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13) but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14) And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

《马太福音》24：3－14——3耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗的来说：“请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和世界的末了，有什么预兆呢？”4耶稣回答说：“你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。5因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说：‘我是基督’，并且要迷惑许多人。6你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌，因为这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。7民要攻打民，国要攻打国，多处必有饥荒、地震。8这都是灾难的起头（“灾难”原文作“生产之难”）。9那时，人要把你们陷在患难里，也要杀害你们；你们又要为我的名被万民恨恶。10那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此陷害，彼此恨恶，11且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。12只因不法的事增多，许多人的爱心才渐渐冷淡了。13惟有忍耐到底的必然得救。14这天国的福音要传遍天下，对万民作见证，然后末期才来到。”

##### G. The Lord Jesus gives us signs that point to His return. These signs can be grouped into three basic kecheng: 主耶稣给了我们他再来的征兆。这些征兆可以分为以下三类：

1. There are signs in nature: earthquakes, floods, eclipses of the sun and moon

    自然界的征兆：地震、洪水、日蚀和月蚀

2. There are signs in the ­lives of people and nations: wars, famines, plagues, wickedness

    国与国、人与人之间的生活征兆：战争、饥荒、瘟疫、邪恶

3. There are signs in religion: persecutions of Christians, false teachers and their damaging heresies, the growing influence of antichrists and the great Anti-Christ (the Man of lawlessness), increasing wickedness, people falling away from the true faith, people becoming more unloving, and the preaching of God’s Word throughout the world.

    宗教方面的征兆：基督徒受到迫害，假教师以及他们破坏性的异端，敌基督势力的增长以及反基督者（无法无天的人），邪恶的增长，人们离开真理的信仰，爱心冷淡，基督的道将传遍全世界。

##### H. These signs of Christ’s return have occurred since the time of Jesus’ first coming, and they continue to take place now. 基督再来的征兆在基督第一次来世间的时候发生过，现在仍在持续。

<br />
Daniel 12:1 – At that time, Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people – everyone whose name is found written in the book – will be delivered.

《但以理书》12：1——“那时，保佑你本国之民的天使长（原文作“大君”）米迦勒必站起来，并且有大艰难，从有国以来直到此时，没有这样的。你本国的民中，凡名录在册上的，必得拯救。

Matthew 24:21-25 – 21) For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equaled again. 22) If those days had not been cut short, no one could survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 23) At that time if anyone says to you ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘There He is!’ do not believe it. 24) For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect – if that were possible. 25) See, I have told you ahead of time.

《马太福音》24：21-25—— 21因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，后来也必没有。22若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了。23那时，若有人对你们说‘基督在这里’，或说‘基督在那里’，你们不要信。24因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事。倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。25看哪，我预先告诉你们了。

##### I. Both the Old Testament prophet, Daniel, and Jesus speak of a time of great distress on earth that will come just before His second coming. This will be a terrible, spiritually oppressive time that God, in His mercy, will limit so that His believers can endure it. 旧约但以理先知与新约的耶稣，都预言了基督再来之前地上的大灾难时期。这将是恐怖的灵性的逼迫，因上帝的怜悯他会限定这些灾难，让信徒能够承受。

<br />
2 Peter 3:3-4 – First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4) They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ He promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”

《彼得后书》3：3－4---第一要紧的，该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人，随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说：4“主要降临的应许在哪里呢？因为从列祖睡了以来，万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。”

Revelation 6:15-17 – 15) Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. 16) They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! 17) For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”

《启示录》6：15－17——地上的君王、臣宰、将军、富户、壮士和一切为奴的、自主的，都藏在山洞和岩石穴里，16向山和岩石说：“倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目和羔羊的忿怒，17因为他们忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？”

##### J. Some unbelievers scoff at the idea of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. However, Jesus will return to the eternal regret and terror of all unbelievers who must face His just and fierce anger over their sin and unbelief. 有些没有信仰的人嘲笑基督的第二次来临。然而，耶稣会再次来到陷入永恒的悔恨与恐怖当中不信他的人面前，他们将必须面对自己的罪与不信所带来的上帝公义的审判与愤怒。

<br />
Luke 21:28 – When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.

《路加福音》21：28 一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首，因为你们得赎的日子近了。”

2 Peter 3:11-12a – 11) Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? 12) You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.

《彼得后书》3：11－12a---这一切既然都要如此销化，你们为人该当怎样圣洁、怎样敬虔，12切切仰望神的日子来到。

Revelation 22:20b – Come, Lord Jesus.

《启示录》22:20b 主耶稣啊，我愿你来！

##### K. Christ’s believing people live in eager expectation of the Second Coming. 信仰基督的人活在急切期盼基督的再来之中。

    基督再来之日，对于基督徒来说是极大喜乐之日。当那日，信徒将经历上帝所有应许的成就和基督得胜的一切祝福的实现。

2. In anticipation of that great day, Christ’s people live their lives with dedication and purpose and in joyful thankfulness to God.
