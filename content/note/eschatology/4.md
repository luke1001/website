#### 4. The Resurrection Of The Dead 从死里复活

Daniel 12:2 – Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.

《但以理书》12：2---睡在尘埃中的，必有多人复醒，其中有得永生的，有受羞辱、永远被憎恶的。

John 5:28-29 －28) Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice 29) and come out – those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.

《约翰福音》5:28-29---你们不要把这事看作希奇，时候要到，凡在坟墓里的，都要听见他的声音，就出来。29行善的复活得生，作恶的复活定罪。

##### A. On the Last Day, at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, God will use His almighty power to raise and reconstitute the bodies of all the dead and reunite each body with the soul that was joined to it before physical death. 当末日来临，耶稣二次再来的时候，上帝将用他的大能让每一个死去的身体复活，并与死前和身体相结合的灵魂再次结合。

1. Some (believers in Jesus Christ who showed their faith by their good deeds) will be raised to enjoy everlasting life.

    有些人（以善行表明他们在基督里的信仰的信徒们）复活获得永生。

2. Others (unbelievers who demonstrated their rejection of Jesus by their evil deeds) will be raised to face everlasting contempt and condemnation.

    其余的人（以恶行表明他们拒绝耶稣基督的不信者）复活面临永远的羞辱与定罪。

<br />
Isaiah 26:19 – But Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.

《以赛亚书》26：19--死人（原文作“你的死人”）要复活，尸首（原文作“我的尸首”）要兴起。睡在尘埃的啊，要醒起歌唱！因你的甘露好像菜蔬上的甘露，地也要交出死人来。

Daniel 12:13 – As for you (Daniel), go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.

《但以理书》12：13——“你（但以理）且去等候结局，因为你必安歇。到了末期，你必起来，享受你的福分。”

Romans 8:11b – He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.

《罗马书》8：11——然而叫耶稣从死里复活者的灵，若住在你们心里，那叫基督耶稣从死里复活的，也必藉着住在你们心里的圣灵，使你们必死的身体又活过来。

1 Thessalonians 4:16 – For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.

《帖撒罗尼迦前书》4：16——因为主必亲自从天降临，有呼叫的声音和天使长的声音，又有　神的号吹响，那在基督里死了的人必先复活。

##### B. God will raise the bodies of His dead believers and restore their souls to them so that they may enjoy eternal life. 上帝首先让去世信徒的灵魂再次与肉体结合，以获得永生。

<br />
Job 19:25-27 – 25) I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end He will stand upon the earth. 26) And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; 27) I myself will see Him with my own eyes – I, and not another. How my heart years within me!

《约伯记》19：25--我知道我的救赎主活着，末了必站立在地上。26我这皮肉灭绝之后，我必在肉体之外得见神。27我自己要见他，亲眼要看他，并不像外人。我的心肠在我里面消灭了。

Philippians 3:20-21 – 20) But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21) who by the power that enables Him to bring everything under His control, will transform out lowly bodies so that they will be like His glorious body.

《腓力比书》3：20－21——我们却是天上的国民，并且等候救主，就是主耶稣基督从天上降临。21他要按着那能叫万有归服自己的大能，将我们这卑贱的身体改变形状，和他自己荣耀的身体相似。

##### C. God will raise the same bodies of believers that entered physical death, but He will transform these bodies in tremendous ways so that they are like the glorified body of the Lord Jesus Christ after His resurrection from the dead. 上帝让基督徒过去的身体复活，但是他会将这些身体以绝妙的方式转变成象耶稣基督死后复活的荣耀的身体。

<br />
2 Corinthians 5:4 – For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.

《哥林多后书》5：4——我们在这帐棚里叹息劳苦，并非愿意脱下这个，乃是愿意穿上那个，好叫这必死的被生命吞灭了。

1 Corinthians 15:42-49 – 42) So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 43) it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44) It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45) So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”, the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 46) The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 47) The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. 48) As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49) And just as we have born the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.

42死人复活也是这样：所种的是必朽坏的，复活的是不朽坏的；43所种的是羞辱的，复活的是荣耀的；所种的是软弱的，复活的是强壮的；44所种的是血气的身体，复活的是灵性的身体。若有血气的身体，也必有灵性的身体。45经上也是这样记着说，“首先的人亚当成了有灵的活人（“灵”或作“血气”）”，末后的亚当成了叫人活的灵。46但属灵的不在先，属血气的在先，以后才有属灵的。47头一个人是出于地，乃属土；第二个人是出于天。48那属土的怎样，凡属土的也就怎样；属天的怎样，凡属天的也就怎样。49我们既有属土的形状，将来也必有属天的形状。

##### D. God reveals and explains some of the tremendous changes that He will bring about in the resurrected bodies of His believers. 上帝启示和解释基督徒复活的身体将要经历的巨大转变。

1. God will take bodies that have perished and make them imperishable. Resurrected believers will be free from decay, decline and death and will be immortal.

    上帝将易朽坏转变为不朽坏的。复活的身体不会腐朽，衰败和死亡，将会永远活着。

    Matthew 13:43a – Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

    《马太福音》13：43a——那时，义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。”

2. God will take the bodies that have entered death in dishonor and make them glorious. Resurrected believers will enjoy special honor, splendor and beauty as God’s people.

    上帝会拿在羞辱中死去的身体，变成荣耀的身体。复活的信徒将会享受上帝子民特别的荣誉、尊荣与美丽。

3. God will take the bodies that have died in weakness and make them powerful. Resurrected believers will be free from weaknesses, illnesses and suffering and will have great ability, energy and strength.

    上帝会拿在软弱中死去的身体，变成强壮的身体。复活的信徒不会再有软弱、病痛和受苦，将会成为有能力的、精力充沛，体力充足的人。

4. God will take bodies that were once “natural” bodies and make them “spiritual” bodies. Resurrected believers will be entirely free from sin and will no longer be in need of food, drink, sleep and other factors that support physical life. Instead, God will give them bodies that are preserved and influenced directly by the Holy Spirit and devoted to holy, spiritual activity.

    上帝会拿曾经是“尘世的有罪的”的身体，变成“天上的属灵的”身体。复活的基督徒完全不会再犯罪，也不再需要肉体的饮食、睡眠以及其他支持肉体生命的元素。相反地，上帝赐给他们的身体，将在圣灵的直接影响和保有之中，只求圣洁、属灵的行为。

<br />
1 Corinthians 15:51-52 – 51) Listen, I tell you a mystery: we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed – 52) in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will all be changed.

《哥林多前书》15：51－52——我如今把一件奥秘的事告诉你们，我们不是都要睡觉，乃是都要改变，52就在一霎时，眨眼之间，号筒末次吹响的时候；因号筒要响，死人要复活，成为不朽坏的，我们也要改变。

##### E. In the case of believers who are alive at the time of Christ’s Second Coming, God will instantly transform their bodies into a glorified condition without requiring them to die. 那些活到耶稣二次再来的基督徒，上帝不会要他们死亡，而是即时将他们的身体转变成荣耀的身体。


<br />
Isaiah 66:24 – And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against Me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”

《以赛亚书》66：24——他们必出去观看那些违背我人的尸首，因为他们的虫是不死的，他们的火是不灭的。凡有血气的都必憎恶他们。”

##### F. God will require unbelievers to have “horrified” bodies that are hideous, disgusting and suffer all the terrible pains and torments of sin forever. 上帝给非信徒一个“恐怖”的身体，他们是丑陋的、令人讨厌的，要永远经历可怕的疼痛和难以忍受的罪的折磨。

<br />
Acts 26:8 – Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?

《使徒行传》26：8——神叫死人复活，你们为什么看作不可信的呢？

Acts 17:32a – When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered.

《使徒行传》17：32a众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的，

##### G. Tragically, some fail to respect God’s power and refuse to believe the teaching of God’s Word that He has raised Jesus Christ from the dead and that He will raise all those who have died at Christ’s Second Coming. 可悲的是，有些人不尊重上帝的大能，拒绝相信上帝的道，就是耶稣从死里复活和耶稣的二次再来时要将所有死人复活的道理。

- “We think it is consequently fair to say, to put it very bluntly, that when a man dies, he is dead. Will there be some sort of mass journey to the throne of God, out of the depths of the sea, out of the innumerable graves, catacombs, crypts, urns and other places of disposal? Is this not too fanciful to bother us, really?” – Professor Gilbert Thiele

- 大体上，我们认为可以非常公平地说，当一个人死时，他就是死的。在海洋的深处、无数的坟墓、地下陵寝、教堂地下墓室、骨灰盒或者其他放置死人的地方之外，还有其他大众化的旅途（或道路）可去上帝的宝座那里吗？这样的想法难道不会太怪诞而让我们困惑吗，真是这样吗？（吉尔伯特·泰尔利）


<br />
Job 14:14 – If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.

《约伯记》14：14——人若死了岂能再活呢？我只要在我一切争战的日子，等我被释放的时候来到（“被释放”或作“改变”）。

John 11:23-27 – 23) Jesus said to Martha, “Your brother will rise again.” 24) Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 25) Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies; 26) and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” 27) “Yes, Lord,” she told Him, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”

《约翰福音》11：23－27——23耶稣说：“你兄弟必然复活。”24马大说：“我知道在末日复活的时候，他必复活。”25耶稣对她说：“复活在我，生命也在我；信我的人，虽然死了，也必复活。26凡活着信我的人必永远不死。你信这话吗？”27马大说：“主啊，是的，我信你是基督，是　神的儿子，就是那要临到世界的。”

##### H. May God grant us the faith of Job and of Martha, who were firmly convinced that God does raise the dead and will give eternal life to His risen believers. 愿神将赐予约伯与马大的信心也赐给我们，他们确信主将赐予信徒从死里复活获得永生。
