#### 9. A Major Error Of The End Times 关于末后的一个重大错误

Matthew 24:3-4, 11 – 3) As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “When will this happened, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 4) Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. . . . 11) and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.”

马太福音24:3-4 ，11

3 耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗的来说，请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事。你降临和世界的末了，有什么预兆呢。4 耶稣回答说，你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们

11 且有好些假先知起来，迷惑多人。

2 Peter 2:1-3a – 1) But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them – bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2) Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3) In their greed, these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up.

彼得后书2:1-3a 

1 从前在百姓中有假先知起来，将来在你们中间，也必有假师傅，私自引进害人的异端，连买他们的主他们也不承认，自取速速的灭亡。 2 将有许多人随从他们邪淫的行为，便叫真道，因他们的缘故被毁谤。 3 他们因有贪心，要用捏造的言语，在你们身上取利。

##### A. Jesus and the inspired writers of the Bible warned that false teachers will appear to attempt to deceive people with their spiritual lies regarding the end times. 耶稣和受圣灵感动的作者都预言假先知的出现，他们会用很多关于末世的属灵谎言来迷惑人。

##### B. One of the great End Time errors promoted in the church on earth is Millenialism. 教会宣讲的其中一个关于末世错误观点就是千禧年

1. Millenialism is the human idea that there will be a special 1,000 year period of prosperity and peace on earth before God ends the world.

    千禧年就是人所认为在主来之前会有的1000年的太平盛世

2. The word “millennium” comes from two Latin words: “mille” which means “1,000” and “annus” which means “year.” Millenialism is also called “Chiliasm.” The word “chiliasm” is from the Greek “chilia” and means “1,000.”

    千禧年“millennium”来自于两个拉丁字母的组合：“mille” 和“annus”，前者意为一千，后者为年。千禧年也被称为“锡利亚说”(Chiliasm)，“Chiliasm”来自希腊词“chilia”意为一千。

3. The idea behind millennialism is based on the appealing, but misguided human desire to have “paradise” on earth; to have people be free of wickedness and evil and enjoy harmony and prosperity as Adam and Eve did before the Fall into Sin.

    千禧年思想是基于人的一种强烈的但错误的愿望就是希望地上可以有天堂，在那里没有邪恶和罪恶取而代之的是和谐与繁荣，正如亚当夏娃犯罪以前。

4. Millenialistic thinking has been and continues to be expressed in many secular and religious forms. Such thinking developed in Judaism in the centuries before Christ. At the time Jesus lived on earth, many Jews were looking for the Messiah to come, free them from oppression, and establish a glorious, earthly kingdom. Jesus’ own disciples indicated that they had been influenced by this thinking when they spoke to Jesus after His resurrection and asked, “Lord, are You at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6).

    千禧年思想在很多世俗和宗教中都有体现。这种思想在主前几个世纪犹太教中就存在。当主耶稣在世的时候，很多犹太人在寻找一位可以救他们脱离压迫建立一个荣耀的地上的国度的弥赛亚。耶稣的门徒也受这种思想的影响，在耶稣复活后他们曾问道：“主阿，你复兴以色列国，就在这时候吗。”

5. Millenialism is not a divine doctrine that is drawn from the Bible. It is, instead, a human opinion that its promoters and defenders impose on the Bible. Millenialists incorrectly use Revelation 20:1-7 and its 6 references to “a thousand years” as a basis for their teaching. In Revelation, Saint John uses the number 1,000 (10x10x10, a multiple of the number 10 used in the book to indicate “completeness”) in a symbolic way to refer to the time between Christ’s first coming and His second coming, the New Testament era. In great disregard for God’s symbolic use of number in Revelation, those who support millennialism insist that the 1,000 years must be taken as a literal period of time. In addition, the millenialists insist on making the reign of the believing dead souls a rule that takes place on earth, when neither Revelation 20, nor any other passage in the Bible speaks about a reign of believers on earth.

    千禧年思想不是来自圣经的属神的教导。相反它是属人的思想，它的倡导者和拥护者把它强加于圣经。千禧年主义者错误的应用启示录20章1-7节和其中六次提到一千年为他们教导的基础。在启示录中，使徒约翰用一千年（10*10*10,三个10连乘代表完全）象征性地代表基督的初次降临到二次降临之间的时间，也就是新约时代。那些支持千禧年主义的人不顾神在启示录中象征性的数字用法，坚持1000年就是字面的一千年。除此之外，尽管启示录20章和其它圣经章节并没有提到信徒在地上掌权统治，千禧年主义者还坚信已去世的信徒的灵魂会掌权统治。

6. There are a number of different forms of Millenialism. Millenialists are very divided, and often inconsistent and contradictory, in their teachings.

    以下是一些不同形式的千禧年主义。千禧年主义者的教导非常有争议，并且通常不连贯和前后矛盾。

    a. Most millenialists are premillenialists, who believe that, after a seven-year period of Great Tribulation, Jesus will return to earth to conduct a thousand year reign of great righteousness, peace and prosperity that includes such things as a general conversion of Jewish people to Christianity, the removal of the anti-christ, and the binding of Satan. Cyrus Scofield, (1842-1921) a lawyer who became a pastor with no theological training, has been very influential in promoting millennialism by popularizing the dispensational views of theologian John Darby (1800-1882) in his Scofield Reference Bible.

    大部分千禧年主义者相信前千禧年主义也就是经过一个七年的苦难期后，基督会再来世上建立一个千年的公义、和平、昌盛的国度，届时犹太教徒会改信基督教，反基督者不复存在，撒旦会被捆绑。司可福(Cyrus Sofield)，出身律师后成为牧师，从没受过任何神学培训，在传扬千禧年主义方面有很大影响力。他在他的司可福串注圣经中普及神学家达秘弟兄(John Darby) 的时代论观点来推介千禧年主义。

    b. Some millenialists are postmillennialists who believe that there will be a thousand-year period during which there will be a gradual reduction of evil and a gradual improvement of social, political, and economic conditions on earth. Christ will come at the end of this time and, after a brief time of Great Tribulation, will judge the world and establish His eternal kingdom.

    一些千禧年主义者相信后千禧年主义。他们相信会有一个一千年的时间期间罪恶会逐渐减少，社会、政治和经济状况会逐渐改善。在这一千年之后和一个短暂的苦难期后基督会再来并且施行审判和建立他的永恒国度。

    c. Millenialists also have great differences in the nature and extent of the improvement they envision coming to the world. The crudest form of millennialism forecasts great material prosperity on earth. The crude form of millennialism expects great spiritual prosperity on earth. The milder form of millennialism simply looks for better times before the end of the world.

    千禧年主义者之间对他们所预期的进步的性质和时间也有很大的不同意见。最粗陋的千禧年主义者预言会有极大的物质丰富。低级的千禧年主义者期望会有灵性的丰盛。较温和(轻度)的千禧年主义者仅仅预期会有一个比末时好一点儿的世期。

7. Millenialism finds wide acceptance in many Christian branches, primarily in Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism, and in Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Holiness church bodies. Millenialism is also a prominent teaching in pseudo-Christian cults such as the Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses.

    很多教派接受千禧年主义，包括基要派和福音派，也包括浸信会、卫理公会、长老会、五旬节派和圣教会分会。千禧年主义也是一些诸如摩门教和耶和华见证人这样异端的重要教导。

8. Millenialism opposes clear biblical teaching in a number of areas.

    千禧年主义与圣经上的几处清楚的教导相违。

    a. Premillenialists hold the mistaken view that Jesus will establish an earthly kingdom. Jesus rejected that claim when He told Pontius Pilate: “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is from another place.” (John 18:36)

    千禧年主义者错误的认为耶稣会建立一个属世的国度。耶稣回答本丢比拉多时否认了这一观点：我的国不属这世界。我的国若属这世界，我的臣仆必要争战，使我不至于被交给犹太人。只是我的国不属这世界。（约18:36）

    b. Postmillenialists hold the erring view that the Christian Church on earth will enjoy a long period of uninterrupted earthly peace and prosperity. Saint Paul rejected that idea when he addressed Christian believers: “We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said. (Acts 14:22b) . . . “Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.” (2 Timothy 3:12)

    后千禧年主义者错误地认为地上的基督教教会会有一个长时期的无争执的属地的平安昌盛时期。 使徒保罗在他的信中否定了这一观点：我们进入神的国，必须经历许多艰难。（徒14:22b） 凡立志在基督耶稣里敬虔度日的，也都要受逼迫。（提后3:12）

    c. Millenialists hold to a literalistic (not literal) view of interpreting Scripture, which fails to recognize the symbolical language that God often employs in the Bible and forces literal interpretations where they are not warranted. For example, millenialists tend not to appreciate that the prophecies God makes about the Messianic kingdom (such as Isaiah 2:2-4, Isaiah 11:6-9; Zechariah 9:9-10; Joel 3:2; Micah 4:1;-4, etc.) are descriptive of and are fulfilled in the spiritual and/or eternal glory of God’s believing people (the Holy Christian Church) which is the result of the Savior’s redeeming work and the proclamation of God’s Word in the world.

    千禧年主义者拘泥于字面意思来解释圣经，不了解圣经中经常运用的不明显的象征性语言。例如，千禧年主义者不相信神关于弥赛亚国度的预言（例如在以赛亚书2:2-4， 11:6-9；撒加利亚书9:9-10； 约珥书3:2；弥迦书4:1,4，等等）是关于神的信徒（圣教会）的属灵和永恒的荣耀的描述和应验，是藉救主的救赎工作及神话语在世界的宣讲而成的。

9. Millenialism is a spiritually dangerous teaching. Some of its dangers are:

    千禧年主义是属灵的危险教导。其中一些危险之处在于：

    a. Millenialism deemphasizes and even despises the role of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in Word and Sacraments as the means of grace for all people of all times.

    千禧年主义者忽视甚至藐视基督耶稣的福音和作为恩典工具之圣礼对所有时代的所有人的作用。

    b. Millenialism teaches people to misread and misinterpret the Bible and to place human opinions over God-given revealed truth.

    千禧年主义教导人去错读和错解圣经，把人的观点置于高于神所启示的真理。

    c. Millenialism confuses people about God’s plans for the future. Millenialism’s focus on things such an earthy rule of Christ, great visible success for the Church, and the nation of Israel, diverts people’s attention away from God’s clear teaching on end times events and priorities.

    千禧年主义使人混淆神将来的计划。千禧年主义注重一些东西，像基督的地上国度、看得见的教会的得胜和以色列国度，这些东西使人偏离神在圣经上对末世事情和属灵属世事情之先后次序的清晰教导。

    d. Millenialism leads people to concentrate their attention on an imaginary paradise on earth rather than on the true paradise in heaven.

    千禧年主义使人关注一个想象中的地上的天堂而不是真实的天上的天堂。

    Colossians 3:1-4 - 1) Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. 2) Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3) For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4) When Christ, who is your life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.”

    歌罗西书1-4---1 所以你们若真与基督一同复活，就当求在上面的事。那里有基督坐在神的右边。 2 你们要思念上面的事，不要思念地上的事。 3 因为你们已经死了，你们的生命与基督一同藏在神里面。4 基督是我们的生命，他显现的时候，你们也要与他一同显现在荣耀里。

10. May God help us resist and oppose the damaging errors of Millenialism and keep our hearts focused on the true, glorious, eternal, heavenly future that He has in store for His believers in Christ.

    愿上帝帮助我们抵制和反对千禧年主义的破坏性影响，使我们的心关注他为我们在基督里建立的真实、荣耀永恒的属天国度。
