#### 8. Eternal Life/Heaven 永生/天堂

Deuteronomy 26:15a – Look down from heaven, Your holy dwelling place.

申命记26:15a 求你从天上你的圣所垂看，

John 3:16 – For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.

约翰福音3:16 “　神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。

##### A. In His Word, God speaks very clearly and powerfully about eternal blessing that He will grant to His believing people as a gracious gift of His love through Jesus Christ in heaven. 在圣经中，上帝非常清楚有力地谈到他将通过在天上的耶稣基督把永远的祝福作为他爱的恩惠之礼赐给他的子民。

John 14:2-3 – In my Father’s house are many rooms (dwelling places); if it were not so I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am..

约翰福音14:2-3 2 在我父的家里有许多住处；若是没有，我就早已告诉你们了。我去原是为你们预备地方去。3 我若去为你们预备了地方，就必再来接你们到我那里去；我在哪里，叫你们也在哪里。

1\. Jesus speaks of heaven as God the Father’s house where believers will live forever with God.

耶稣说天堂是天父的家，在那里信徒将永远与神同住。

Revelation 2:7 – He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.

启示录2:7 圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，我必将　神乐园中生命树的果子赐给他吃。’

2\. The Lord Jesus speaks of heaven as the paradise of God, the beautiful garden-like place where people enjoy peace and bliss after physical death.

主耶稣说天堂是神的国度，是美丽的花园，那里人们享受死后的各样平安和祝福。

2 Timothy 4:18, 8 – The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. . . . Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day – and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.

提摩太后书4:18,8 

8 主必救我脱离诸般的凶恶，也必救我进他的天国。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿们。……

18 从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。

3\. God inspired Paul to speak of heaven as God’s heavenly kingdom, where God rules in endless glory and shares the righteous blessings of Christ’s victory with all believers.

上帝感动保罗说天堂是神的王国，上帝在无尽的荣耀中统治那里，与所有信徒分享耶稣胜利的公义的祝福。

2 Corinthians 5:8 – We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

哥林多后书 5:8 我们坦然无惧，是更愿意离开身体与主同住。

4\. God moved Paul to also speak of heaven as the place where believers are at home with the Lord.

上帝感动保罗同样说天堂 是信徒与主同住的地方。

Revelation 21:10-11, 16a, 18, 21-24, 27 – 10) And the angel carried me away in the spirit, to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 11) It shone like the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. . . . 16a) The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. . . . 18) The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. . . . 21) The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass. 22) I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 23) The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 24) The nations will walk be its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. . . . 27) Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.

启示录21:10-11， 16a， 18,21-24,27 

10我被圣灵感动，天使就带我到一座高大的山，将那由　神那里，从天而降的圣城耶路撒冷指示我，11城中有　神的荣耀；城的光辉如同极贵的宝石，好象碧玉，明如水晶。

16a城是四方的，长宽一样。……

18 墙是碧玉造的，城是精金的，如同明净的玻璃。

21十二个门是十二颗珍珠；每门是一颗珍珠。城内的街道是精金，好象明透的玻璃。22我未见城内有殿，因主　神，全能者和羔羊为城的殿。23那城内又不用日月光照，因有　神的荣耀光照，又有羔羊为城的灯。24列国要在城的光里行走；地上的君王必将自己的荣耀归与那城。

27凡不洁净的，并那行可憎与虚谎之事的，总不得进那城；只有名字写在羔羊生命册上的才得进去。

5\. God also revealed to the apostle John in symbolic visions that heaven is the city of indescribable and ultimate beauty, perfection, and holiness where God dwells in His glory and serves as the source of all its blessings.

神也在异象中揭示使徒约翰，天堂是一座无法形容且极为漂亮完美的城，上帝在他的荣耀中居住的圣洁之地，一切祝福之源。

1 Peter 1:3-4 – Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4) and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade – kept in heaven for you.

彼得前书1:3-4 

3愿颂赞归与我们主耶稣基督的父　神！他曾照自己的大怜悯，藉耶稣基督从死里复活，重生了我们，叫我们有活泼的盼望，4可以得着不能朽坏，不能玷污，不能衰残，为你们存留在天上的基业。

Psalm 16:11 – You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence, with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.

诗篇16:11你必将生命的道路指示我。在你面前有满足的喜乐，在你右手中有永远的福乐。

##### B. God will provide many, positive, joyful blessings to His Christians in heaven. 神为天堂中的基督徒提供许多积极喜乐的祝福。

Matthew 5:8 – Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

哥林多前书13:12a 我们如今仿佛对着镜子观看，模糊不清(“模糊不清”原文作“如同猜谜”)，到那时，就要面对面了。

1 John 3:2 – Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.

约翰一书3:2亲爱的弟兄啊，我们现在是　神的儿女，将来如何，还未显明；但我们知道，主若显现，我们必要象他，因为必得见他的真体。

Psalm 17:15 – And I – in righteousness I will see Your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing Your likeness.

诗篇17:15 至于我，我必在义中见你的面。我醒了的时候，得见你的形像（见或作看），就心满意足了。

Revelation 21:3 – And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Now the dwelling of God is with people and He will live with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.”

启示录21:3 我听见有大声音从宝座出来说：“看哪！　神的帐幕在人间。他要与人同住，他们要作他的子民；　神要亲自与他们同在，作他们的　神。

1\. The greatest blessing of heaven is that believers will live in the presence of God Himself and will see and know Him intimately and thoroughly and will experience perfect, unending happiness and satisfaction in this condition.

天堂中最大的祝福就是信徒和神自己同住，并会亲切地完全地知道他，并将经历完全、无尽的喜乐和满足。

2\. This blessing is called “The Beatific Vision.” This condition has been defined as: “the direct access to God and the intimate knowledge of God that the holy angels and glorified believers enjoy in heaven, in which they experience supreme, complete, eternal bliss.”

这祝福称为“佳美异象”。被定义为：“与神直接相通，亲密地认识神，这正是众圣天使和得荣耀的信徒在天堂里所享受的，在那里他们经历至高、完全和永恒的祝福。”

1 John 3:2b – But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him.

约翰一书3:2b但我们知道，主若显现，我们必要象他，因为必得见他的真体。

Revelation 7:9, 13-14 – 9) After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. . . 13) Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes – who are they, and where did the come from? 14) I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “There are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”

启示录7:9,13-14 

9此后，我观看，见有许多的人，没有人能数过来，是从各国、各族、各民、各方来的，站在宝座和羔羊面前，身穿白衣，手拿棕树枝，

13长老中有一位问我说：“这些穿白衣的是谁？是从哪里来的？”14我对他说：“我主，你知道。”他向我说：“这些人是从大患难中出来的，曾用羔羊的血，把衣裳洗白净了，

3\. In heaven, believers will be sinless and holy like Jesus Christ, purified by Christ Himself from all sin and evil forever.

在天堂里，信徒将会无罪，像基督耶稣一样圣洁，所有的罪和邪恶将被基督永远洁净了。

5\. In heaven, believers will enjoy great glory as God’s people. They will live in the glorious light that God provides for them. God will allow them to participate in His triumphant rule over all things forever.

路加福音12:33b用不尽的财宝在天上，就是贼不能近，虫不能蛀的地方。

2\. Will we know our believing friends and relatives and will we be able to have a similar relationship with them in heaven?


我们会知道我们那些信徒朋友和亲属，还能在天堂里与他们有在地相似的关系吗？

3\. Will we miss unbelieving friends and relatives who went to hell?

我们会思念我们没有信的在地狱的朋友吗？

Luke 20:34-36 – Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part I that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.”

路加福音20:34-36 耶稣说：“这世界的人有娶有嫁；惟有算为配得那世界，与从死里复活的人，也不娶也不嫁；因为他们不能再死，和天使一样；既是复活的人，就为　神的儿子。

4\. Heaven will not be the same kind of existence that people have on earth.

天堂与我们在地上所看到的一切不一样。

5\. There is no marriage, having children or death in heaven.

没有婚姻，没有子女，也没有死亡。

6\. The great factor that unites people in heaven is spiritual – their common faith in Jesus Christ.

在天堂联系人们的重要因素是灵——他们对于耶稣基督的信。

Luke 7:11-15 – Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and His disciples and a large crowd went along with Him. As He approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out – the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, His heart went out to her and He said, “Don’t cry.” Then He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!” The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.

路加福音 7:11-15 过了不多时(有古卷作“次日”)，耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来；这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇；有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。主看见那寡妇就怜悯她，对她说：“不要哭。”于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说：“少年人，我吩咐你，起来！”那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。

7\. Based on Jesus’ practice of reuniting people with their loved ones after He raised them from the dead during His earthly ministry, it is fair to conclude that He will reunite believing family members and friends in heaven whose relationships had been separated by death.

根据耶稣在地上的事工结束后从死中被提之后，把人们和他们所爱的人再次聚集起来这点，很清楚能总结出，他将把因死亡而分离的信徒的家庭成员和朋友在天堂中重新聚集起来。

Psalm 16:11 – You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence, with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.

诗篇16:11你必将生命的道路指示我。在你面前有满足的喜乐，在你右手中有永远的福乐。

8\. Because heaven is a place of perfect joy, believers will not experience any thing that pains or saddens them. If believers retain their knowledge of people who are not in heaven, they will hold their memories without pain.

因为天堂是一个完全喜乐之地，信徒不会经历任何痛苦和悲伤之事。如果信徒对于那些没有在天堂的人有记忆的话，他们的记忆中不会有痛苦。

##### F. Degrees Of Glory In Heaven 天堂中荣耀的级别

1\. There are no degrees of bliss or joy in heaven. All believers will share equally in the great delights of heaven’s blessings.

天堂中福气和喜乐没有级别。所有的信徒都公平的分享天堂的祝福。

2 Corinthians 9:6 – Remember this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

哥林多后书 9:6 少种的少收，多种的多收，”这话是真的。

1 Corinthians 15:41-42 – 41) The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; the star differs from star in splendor. 42) So it will be with the resurrection of the dead.

哥林多前书15:41-42 

41日有日的荣光，月有月的荣光，星有星的荣光；这星和那星的荣光，也有分别。42死人复活也是这样：所种的是必朽坏的，复活的是不朽坏的；

Daniel 12:3 – Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.

但以理书12：3智慧人必发光，如同天上的光；那使多人归义的，必发光如星，直到永永远远。

Matthew 19:28 – Jesus said to them (the apostles), “I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

马太福音19:28耶稣说：“我实在告诉你们，你们这跟从我的人，到复兴的时候，人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。

2\. God does seem to indicate that there may be degrees of glory in heaven, according to the measure of service rendered or suffering endured for God during life on earth.

上帝好像说天堂里的荣耀有级别，按着在地上服侍的轻重和为神所受的苦的多少计算一样。

a. Martin Luther shared his opinion on this matter: “It is true, there will be a difference in the next life, according as people have labored and lived here. One believer will have greater brightness than the other because he worked or suffered more in his position. Everyone will have his distinction and glory according to His position. Still one God and Lord will be in all, and each will have the one and the same joy and bliss. In his person none shall be more or have works, through which he will shine and praise God so that people will say: St. Peter has done more than I or another. This man or this woman has led such a fine life and done such great things. In short, all are to be alike before God in faith and grace and celestial bliss, but they are to differ in their works and their honor.”

马丁路德分享了他对此事的想法：“确实，在下一次生命中会有不同，有如这里劳动生活的人们。一个信徒在他的职分上因为做的工多或受的苦多而更加闪光。每个人因他的职位不同其荣耀会有所不同。然而独一的真神将在所有人的心里，每个人都将拥有同样的喜乐和祝福。神的子民中无人或有行为可藉以更闪光和更加赞美神，以致人们说，圣彼得比我或别人作的更多。这个弟兄或这个姐妹过了这么好的人生，成就了如此大的事情。简言之，所有人在神面前的信心、恩典和属天的祝福上都是相似的，只是他们的职位和荣耀有所不同。”

b. Since everyone in heaven will be holy and without sin, there will be no envy or jealously in heaven. Like the holy angels, the glorified saints of heaven will be filled only with the love-filled joy over the wonderful things other believers have done in service to the Savior and His people. Believers will be happy for each other over the glory each receives.

因为在天堂里的每个人都是圣洁无罪的，所以没有嫉妒和猜疑。如同圣洁的天使，天堂里的圣徒都被爱充满，因其他信徒服侍救主和他的子民的奇妙事工而被喜乐充满。信徒在所受的荣耀里彼此都很美好。

Psalm 73:23-26 – 23) Yet I am always with You; You hold me by my right hand. 24) You guide me with Your counsel, and afterward You will take me into glory. 25) Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides You. 26) My heart and my flesh may fail, but God is the Strength of my heart and my Portion forever.

诗篇73:23-26 

23然而我常与你同在，你搀着我的右手。24你要以你的训言引导我，以后必接我到荣耀里。25除你以外，在天上我有谁呢？除你以外，在地上我也没有所爱慕的。26我的肉体和我的心肠衰残；但　神是我心里的力量，又是我的福分，直到永远。

Philippians 3:14, 20 – 14) I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. . . . 20) But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.

腓立比书3:14,20 

14向着标竿直跑，要得　神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。 

20我们却是天上的国民，并且等候救主，就是主耶稣基督，从天上降临。

2 Timothy4: 6b-8 – 6) The time has come for my departure. 7) I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8) Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day – and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.

提摩太后书4: 6b-8 

6我离世的时候到了。7那美好的仗我已经打过了，当跑的路我已经跑尽了，所信的道我已经守住了。 8从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。

##### G. The wonderful biblical teaching of eternal life leads believers in Christ to continue in their faith in Jesus and to look forward with great eagerness to be with God and enjoy the blessings of heaven forever. 圣经关于永远生命的奇妙的教导引领信徒在耶稣基督里继续坚固信心，盼望与神同在，永远享受天堂的祝福。
