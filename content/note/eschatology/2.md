##### B. The Condition Of The Souls Of Non-Christians After Death In Hell 非基督徒死后的灵魂在地狱里面的状况


1 Peter 3:18b-20 a – He (Christ) was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit, through which He went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.

《彼得前书》3：18b－20a——按着肉体说，他被治死；按着灵性说，他复活了。19他藉这灵曾去传道给那些在监狱里的灵听，20就是那从前在挪亚预备方舟、神容忍等待的时候，不信从的人。

1\. After physical death, the souls of non-Christians are imprisoned in hell where they are kept, guarded and watched as a punishment on their sin and unbelief.

非基督徒死后他们的灵魂是在地狱里面囚禁着，监管者和监视着，作为他们罪与不信的惩罚。

<br />
Luke 16:22-31 – 22) The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23) In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24) So he called to him, “Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire”. 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26) And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.” 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment. 29) Abraham replied, “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.” 30) “No, Father Abraham,” he said, “but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.” 31) He said to him, “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.”

《路加福音》16：22－31——22后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。23他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远的望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，24就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。’25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。26不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。’27财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。’29亚伯拉罕说：‘他们有摩西和先知的话可以听从。’30他说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的，若有一个从死里复活的，到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。’31亚伯拉罕说：‘若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。’”

2\. After physical death, the souls of non-Christians go to the place called hell. In hell, these souls experience great torments. They suffer tremendous, agonizing pains and long for even some small relief from their affliction. They sorrow over their sins and desire to escape their punishment, but cannot.

非基督徒死后灵魂去的地方叫地狱。在地狱当中，他们的灵魂要经历极大的煎熬。他们经历着极大的痛苦与磨难，他们渴望稍微减轻一些自己的苦难。他们为自己的罪恶和欲望感到悲伤，想要逃避惩罚，却是不能。

##### C. The Conditions Of The Souls Of Christians After Death In Heaven 基督徒死后他们的灵魂在天堂的状况

Revelation 14:13 – Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”

《启示录》14：13——我听见从天上有声音说：“你要写下，从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了！”圣灵说：“是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，作工的果效也随着他们。”

1\. After physical death, the souls of Christians enter heaven, where they enter a condition of supreme blessing and joy. These souls experience a welcome, gladdening rest and relief from the burdens, struggles and pains of their earthly lives.

基督徒死后灵魂进入天堂，是享受极大祝福与欢喜的一个地方。这些灵魂脱离了世上的争战与痛苦，体验了欢迎与享受安息。

<br />
Luke 23:42-43 – Then he (the believing robber) said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.” 43) Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with Me in paradise.”

《路加福音》23：42－43——他（有信心的强盗）就说：“耶稣啊，你得国降临的时候，求你记念我！”43耶稣对他说：“我实在告诉你：今日你要同我在乐园里了。”

2\. After physical death, the souls of believers enter into God’s kingdom of glory where they experience the blessed presence of God and live forever in the place of endless happiness.

基督徒死后进入到上帝荣耀的国度里面，在那里经历上帝的祝福，与上帝同在直到永远，享受永远的欢喜。

<br />
Philippians 1:21-23 – 21) For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. 22) I I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! 23) I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is better by far;

《腓立比书》1：21－23——因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处。22但我在肉身活着，若成就我工夫的果子，我就不知道该挑选什么。23我正在两难之间，情愿离世与基督同在，因为这是好得无比的。

3\. After physical death, the souls of Christians live on and experience the gain of going to be with Christ in heaven. Being with Christ in heaven is a far better existence than a person can have on earth and is something believers look forward to with great anticipation.

基督徒的灵魂在肉体的生命结束后，会在天堂与基督同在。与基督同在天堂的状况远远胜于一个人在世上所能有的一切，也是信徒们怀着巨大预期的期盼。

<br />
Luke 16:22a, 25 – 22) The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.

《路加福音》16：22a，后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。

4\. After physical death, the souls of believers are taken by the angels to heaven. In these verses, heaven is referred to as “Abraham’s side (bosom).” Abraham is the “father of believers.” The bosom is the place of favor and closeness. This reference indicates that heaven is the place of close, caring relationships among God and His people where believers enjoy special love and comfort.

基督徒的灵魂在肉体生命结束后被天使带到天堂。在这段经文中，天堂被形容为“亚伯拉罕的身旁（怀中）”。亚伯拉罕是“信心之父”。怀中是一个宠爱与亲密的地方。这象征天堂是一个上帝与他的子民关系亲密之地，在那里所有的信徒一起享受特别的爱与安慰。

<br />
Isaiah 57:1-2 – 1) The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. 2) Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.

《以赛亚书》57：1－2---义人死亡，无人放在心上；虔诚人被收去，无人思念。这义人被收去是免了将来的祸患。2他们得享（原文作“进入”）平安。素行正直的，各人在坟里（原文作“床上”）安歇。

5\. After physical death, the souls of Christians are freed from being troubled by evil. They enter God’s peace in which they receive wholeness and well-being throughout and enjoy a wonderful home in which they experience a quiet, rest from the cares and troubles of earthly life.

在肉体生命结束后，基督徒的灵魂从罪恶的捆绑中得释放。他们进入上帝的平安当中，获得完全，享受美好的天家，脱离世上的顾虑，麻烦，享受宁静的安息。

##### D. The Departed Souls’ Knowledge Of The Living 死人的灵魂对过去活着状态的认知

Luke 16:27-28 - 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.

《路加福音》16：27－28——财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。

1\. The rich man remembered that he had five brothers who lived with their father and who did not believe in the true God. (It seems as if the departed souls retain some past knowledge of things on earth.)

这个财主记得他父亲的家里有五个兄弟，他们还没有认识真正的神。（这似乎说明死人的灵魂对过去在世间的事情是有认知的）

<br />
Isaiah 63:16 – But You are our Father though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is Your name.

《以赛亚书》63：16——亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父，从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。

2\. Abraham, who died 1250 years before Isaiah, and Israel (Jacob), who lived 1050 years before Isaiah, did not know and could not acknowledge Isaiah or the people living at his time. (It seems as if departed souls have no knowledge of what is currently happening in the world)

早于以赛亚1250年的亚伯拉罕和早于以赛亚1050年的以色列（雅各）不知道也没有任何关于以赛亚生存时代的认知。（这似乎表明，与肉体分离的灵魂对于后来的世界是没有任何认知的）

<br />
Revelation 6:9-11 – 9) When He (Jesus, the Lamb of God) opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10) They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until You judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” 11) Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.

《启示录》6：9－11---9揭开第五印的时候，我看见在祭坛底下，有为　神的道、并为作见证被杀之人的灵魂，10大声喊着说：“圣洁真实的主啊，你不审判住在地上的人，给我们伸流血的冤，要等到几时呢？”11于是有白衣赐给他们各人，又有话对他们说：“还要安息片时，等着一同作仆人的和他们的弟兄也像他们被杀，满足了数目。

3\. The souls in heaven are aware of what happened to them in the past on earth and are aware that the Last Day of Judgment has not yet occurred. (It seems as if departed souls have the general knowledge that the world in which they lived still exists)

天上的灵魂对过去在地上所发生的事情是有认知的，也知道审判之日还没有来临。（这似乎表明这些脱离了肉体的灵魂对他们活时的状况有普遍的认知）。

##### E. The Possibility Of Reincarnation, Soul Migration Or A Second Chance At Salvation 投胎的可能，灵魂的迁徙或者再次救恩的机会

Hebrews 9:27-28 – 27) Just as a person is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28) so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.”

《希伯来书》9：27－28----27按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。28像这样，基督既然一次被献，担当了多人的罪，将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现，并与罪无关，乃是为拯救他们。

- A person is given the chance to live once on earth. After earthly life is over, that person’s soul appears before God to be judged and given its eternal destiny.

- 一个人的生命只有一次。肉体的生命结束后，一个人的灵魂离开肉体，来到上帝的面前接受审判，命定永恒的归宿。

##### F. Communicating With The Dead 与死人的交流

Luke 16:27-28 - 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.

《路加福音》16：27－28---财主说：‘我祖啊，既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去，28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。

1\. The rich man, who was in hell, realized that he could not personally communicate with his brothers who still lived on earth.

在地狱里的这个财主意识到自己不能与在世间仍然活着的兄弟们交流。

<br />
Isaiah 63:16 – But You are our Father though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is Your name.

《以赛亚书》63：16亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父，从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。

2\. Abraham and Israel had died and did not communicate with or respond to the living.

亚伯拉罕与以色列已经死亡，不会与现今仍然活着的人交流与回应。

<br />
Matthew 17:3 – Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.

《马太福音》17：3忽然，有摩西、以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣说话。

3\. In a special miracle, God sent Moses and Elijah (both who had died and/or went to heaven centuries before) to visit Jesus at His Transfiguration and speak with Him.

在一个特殊的神迹中，上帝打发摩西、以利亚（他们都是已经死去、或者说多个世纪前就去天堂了）来探访耶稣，在登山变像的时候与耶稣说话。

4\. 1 Samuel 28:11-19 God sent (*may have sent) Samuel back from the dead to speak with King Saul. (Note: some scholars think that the “Samuel” who appeared to the witch of Endor and Saul was an evil angel impersonating the real Samuel)

《撒母耳记上》28：11-19 , 上帝打发（可能是差遣）撒母耳从死里回到扫罗的面前与他对话。（注解：有些圣经学者认为那个“撒母耳”是魔鬼装扮的，一个邪恶的天使给扫罗装扮了撒母耳的形象）
