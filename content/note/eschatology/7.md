### THE LAST THINGS (Eschatology) 末后的事（末世论）

#### 7. Eternal Damnation/Hell 永罚/地狱

Hebrews 10:26-27, 31 – If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. . . . It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

希伯来书10:26-27,31 

26 因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了；27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众敌人的烈火。

31落在永生　神的手里，真是可怕的！

Luke 16:22-23 – The rich man also died and was buried. 23) In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.

路加福音16:22-23---后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里……

##### A. In His Word, God speaks very clearly and powerfully about eternal torments that He will administer to ungodly people as punishment for their sin and unbelief in a place called hell. 在圣经中，神明确而有力的说到，对那些不敬畏神的人的罪与不信将在名叫地狱的地方有永远的痛苦作为惩罚。

Luke 16:24-28 - 24) So he (the rich man) called to him, “Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire”. 25) But Abraham replied, “Son, remember that in your lifetime you received you good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26) And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.” 27) He answered, “Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28) for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.

路加福音16:24-28---24就喊着说：‘我祖亚伯拉罕哪！可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。’25亚伯拉罕说：‘儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦，如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。26不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。’27财主说：‘我祖啊！既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去；28因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。’

1. God describes hell as a place of great agony with fiery pains in which people are separated forever from all that is good. (Note: the word translated “hell” in Luke 16 is the Greek word “Hades”, which is the place where the departed souls of the spiritually lost go to be punished.)

    上帝描述地狱是一个如同火烧般极度痛苦的地方，那里同一切美好隔离。（注: 在路加福音16章中的“地狱”一词在希腊语中是“Hades”，意思是堕落灵魂将被审判之地。）

    Matthew 5:22 – But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brothers will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca’ is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, “You fool!” will be in danger of the fire of hell.

    马太福音5:22--只是我告诉你们：凡向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判(有古卷在“凡”字下添“无缘无故地”五字)；凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断；凡骂弟兄是魔利的，难免地狱的火。

2. God describes hell as the place of fiery judgment and punishment. (Note: the word translated “hell” in Matthew 5 is the Greek word “Gehenna”, which is derived from the name of the valley near Jerusalem where the garbage and the bodies of dead animals were taken to be deposited and burned. The word “Gehenna” carries the unpleasant ideas of death, fire, smoke and an unbearable smell.)

    上帝描述地狱是炙热的审判与惩罚之地。（注：马太福音5章的单词“地狱”是由希腊语“Gehenna”翻译而来，这个词是从耶路撒冷附近的一个山谷的名字而来，那里是垃圾和动物的死尸被带去焚烧之地。单词“Gehenna”含有死亡、火焰、烟以及难闻的气味这些不好的含义。）

3. God uses a number of other terms to describe hell:

    上帝使用许多其他的词来描述地狱。

    Matthew 13:41-42 – 41) The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42) They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

    马太福音 13:41-42---41人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，42 丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。

    a. Hell is portrayed as a furnace of fire where people are confined and experience extreme anguish, pain, anger and rage.

    地狱被描述为一个火炉，在那里人被幽禁并经受痛苦、疼痛、愤怒和狂暴。

    Matthew 25:41 – “Then He (Jesus) will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,’ you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared from the devil and His angels.

    马太福音 25:41--王又要向那左边的说：‘你们这被咒诅的人，离开我！进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！

    b. Hell is the place of eternal fire (originally created as a place of punishment for the evil angels) where the unbelievers experience God’s curse on their sin and unbelief.

    地狱是永火之处，在那里所有不信的人都要经受神对他们的罪和不信的咒诅。（永火最初为惩罚罪恶的天使而创造）

    Matthew 25:46a – “Then they will go away to eternal punishment.”

    马太福音25:46a “这些人要往永刑里去；”

    c. Hell is the place of eternal punishment where people face the just consequences of their sins.
    
    地狱是永远的审判之地，在那里人们要面对他们犯罪的后果。

    Philippians 3:19a – “Their destiny is destruction.”

    腓立比书3:19a--“这些人要往永刑里去；”

    d. Hell is the place of destruction where people are brought to ruin, (but are not annihilated).
    
    地狱是毁灭之地，在那里人们被带去毁灭（但永不消亡。）

    2 Thessalonians 1:9 – They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power.

    帖撒罗尼加后书1：9--他们要受刑罚，就是永远沉沦，离开主的面和他权能的荣光。

    e. Hell is the place of everlasting destruction and exclusion from God’s gracious presence and blessing.
    
    地狱是永恒的毁灭之地，且与神的圣洁和祝福永远分离。

    2 Peter 2:17 – These men are like springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.

    彼得后书2:17--这些人是无水的井，是狂风催逼的雾气，有墨黑的幽暗为他们存留。

    f. Hell is the place of deep and dense darkness where people are in desolate isolation from all comforts and companionship.

    地狱是又深又浓的黑暗之所，那里人是孤独的，没有任何安慰和友谊。

    Revelation 20:14 – Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.

    启示录20:14--死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里；这火湖就是第二次的死。

    g. Hell is the lake of fire and the second death.
    
    地狱是火湖，是第二次的死。

<br />
Psalm 11:5-6 – 5) The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked and those who love violence His soul hates. 6) On the wicked He will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.

诗篇 11:5-6---5耶和华试验义人；惟有恶人和喜爱强暴的人，他心里恨恶。6他要向恶人密布网罗，有烈火、硫磺、热风，作他们杯中的分。

Psalm 38:4, 8 – My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. I am feeble and utterly crushed: I groan in anguish of heart.

诗篇 38:4,8 

4我的罪孽高过我的头，如同重担叫我担当不起。

8我被压伤，身体疲倦；因心里不安，我就唉哼。

##### B. The worst part of hell is having an eternally condemning and tormenting conscience which is plagued with the continual dread of God’s wrath and which realizes that there is no hope of relief or deliverance. 地狱最坏之处是良心被永远的审判和折磨，是对神持久愤怒的恐惧，并且没有减轻痛苦的希望。

<br />
Luke 12:47-48 – 47) That servant who knows his master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. 48) From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.

路加福音12:47-48---47仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备，又不顺他的意思行，那仆人必多受责打；48 惟有那不知道的，作了当受责打的事，必少受责打；因为多给谁，就向谁多取；多托谁，就向谁多要。

Matthew 11:20-24 – 20) Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. 21) “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22) But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. 23) And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you have been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. 24) But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”

马太福音 11:20-24---20耶稣在诸城中行了许多异能，那些城的人终不悔改，就在那时候责备他们说： 21 “哥拉汛哪，你有祸了！伯赛大啊，你有祸了！因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。22但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，推罗、西顿所受的，比你们还容易受呢！23迦百农啊，你已经升到天上(或作“你将要升到天上吗？”)，将来必坠落阴间，因为在你那里所行的异能，若行在所多玛，它还可以存到今日。24但我告诉你们，当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比你还容易受呢！”

##### C. Jesus teaches that there will be differences in the suffering that people experience in hell. Hell will be terrible for everyone who is there, but it will be worse for some than others. Those who have more knowledge of God’s will and more opportunities to hear the Gospel will face a harsher punishment if they reject the Gospel. 耶稣教导说在地狱中人们所经历的痛苦会有不同。地狱里的人都回感到地狱的可怕，但地狱里的人一些会比另一些更痛苦些。对于那些知道多一些神的旨意，多些机会听神的福音的人，若是他们拒绝福音所受的审判将会更严厉。

##### D. Some Bible-based descriptions and observations about hell. 一些基于圣经的关于地狱的描述和揭示。

1. There is an everlasting hell
    
    And everlasting pains;
    
    There sinners must with devils dwell

    In darkness, fire and chains. – Isaac Watts

    地狱的永远存在。

    无尽的痛苦。

    在那里罪人和魔鬼住在一起。

    在黑暗、火焰和捆绑中。——Isaac Watts

2. This is the terrible judgment that is bound to come upon the unbelieving.: their hands and feet shall be tied, and they shall be cast into outermost darkness, that is, they must eternally lie captive with the devil in hell-fire. For their hands and feet are tied, so that they will not be able to free themselves by doing works. Besides, they must lie in darkness, cut off from God’s light, that is, from all comfort, in eternal torment, anguish, and sadness, so that they will nevermore see one spark of light. This is terrible misery, if only we would let it touch our heart: to lie captive in this way in hell and torment forever, with nothing but wailing and gnashing of teeth. By these things the Lord indicates all imaginable torments. Christ says in effect: You will suffer more than words can tell and thoughts can grasp. – Martin Luther, commending on Matthew 22:13

    这是对于不信的可怕的审判：他们的手脚被绑，被扔在遥远的黑暗中，那里，他们只能永远在地狱之火中与魔鬼同为俘虏。他们的手脚被绑，就不能藉做工使他们重获自由。除此以外，他们躺在黑暗中，与神的光隔离，与安慰隔绝，在永远的痛苦、苦闷和悲哀中，以致永远看不见一点亮光。这是可怕的痛苦，如果我们仅仅用心想一下：在地狱里做这样的俘虏并永远受折磨，除了哭泣和切齿以外什么都没有。用这些事主表明了所有能想象得到的痛苦。事实上基督在说：你们将要承受比言语能说比思维能领会的更多的痛苦。——马丁路德，对于马太福音22:13的注解。

3. “In hell, the people there experience the sharpest pains of soul and body (because they have sinned in both body and soul). These pains come from the extremely just wrath and vengeance of God against their sins. Those in hell carry the sad consciousness of their sins with them. The indecency of their sins is openly revealed. They have no hope of forgiveness. For them there will be no easing or end to their sufferings. In their grief and misery, they will wail and howl to utterly denounce their former despising of sacred things. Their laments over their sinful and careless decisions to neglect the commands of the Lord, to ignore the spiritual warnings and encouragements of those around them and to despise the means of attaining salvation will be in vain.

    “在地狱，人们经历灵魂和身体的极度的痛苦（因为他们身体和灵魂都有罪）。”这些痛苦出自极度的愤怒和神对他们罪的惩罚。那些地狱里人带着他们罪的果子。他们败坏的罪行被完全揭露。他们没有被赦免的盼望。对于他们的苦难将没有尽头无法消除。他们将在悲伤和痛苦中哀嚎、咆哮，毫无保留地声讨他们以前对神圣事物的蔑视。他们为轻率地忽视主的教导、忽视属灵的警告、周围朋友的鼓励、蔑视救恩的途径的哀伤将是徒劳。

    The people in hell exist in perpetual anguish and terror; in shame, confusion and dishonor; in unquenchable fire, in weeping and gnashing of teeth; among eternally terrible things, torn away from the grace and favor of God, quivering in fear among the demons and tortured without end to eternity. These future torments of the damned far surpass all that the human mind can conceive. They are so great that they cannot be comprehended. They are so severe that they cannot be expressed in words. In order to show how great and sharp they are, Scripture likens them to the things in this life that bring great pain to both body and soul. So the pains of hell are compared to the gnashing of teeth, the gnawing of worms, the most sorrowful darkness and whatever other matters of sadness and excruciating pain that can be mentioned.” - Matthew Haffenreffer

    地狱里的人永远在痛苦与恐怖中；在惭愧、迷惑和耻辱中；在永不熄灭的火中；在哭泣与切齿中；在永远的可怕的事情中；远离神的恩典，在魔鬼中恐惧颤抖，永无止尽的痛苦。这些将来的痛苦远超人之想象，其巨大非人所能理解的，其严重无法用言语来表达。为了描述它的巨大和严重，圣经用能带给肉体和灵魂大痛苦的事情来类比。这种地狱的痛苦常与能提到的咬牙切齿的痛恨、不死的虫、悲痛的黑暗和一切的可以想象的哀伤失落相比较。-Matthew Haffenreffer

4. Hell is a matter of both an intense, continuous, indescribable loss of blessings and an intense, continuous, indescribable experience of torments.

    . The damned are prevented from enjoying blessings such as:

    a) the blessed presence of God

    b) association with good things and good beings

    c) heaven’s light, comfort, rest and joy

    d) love and kindness

    e) hope

    地狱是强烈的，持续的，无法形容的恩典的失去。是强烈的、持续的、无法形容的痛苦的经历。

    . 受咒咀的被隔绝的祝福如：

    a. 见神面的祝福

    b．与好事情好行为的联系
    
    c．天堂的光、安慰、安息和喜乐

    d．爱和仁慈

    e．希望

    . The damned are forced to suffer curses such as:

    a) excruciating bodily pains, such as fiery burns

    b) harassment by demons and evils

    c) uncontrolled hatred, rage and self-
loathing

    d) an endlessly tormenting conscience

    e) doom and despair

    . 受咒咀的所要面对的咒诅如下：

    a. 身体的痛苦，比如永火的焚烧

    b．魔鬼和罪恶的骚扰

    c．不可控制的恨、愤怒和自我放弃。

    d. 无尽痛苦的心

    e．厄运和绝望

5. “Hell is so horrible. We should not think or speak of hell without tears in our eyes.” - John Stott

    “地狱太可怕了。我们想到谈到关于地狱的事的时候眼中应该有眼泪。”John Stott

6. “I wish that I could take you to hell for two weeks so we could personally experience how terrible it is. Then, when we return to this world, I pray that we would speak and live so that we make sure that no one would ever go there.” - William Booth

    “我希望我能带你到地狱逛两周，我们就能亲身感受到地狱是多可怕了。然后，当我们回到这个世界的时候，我祈祷我们每个人传讲生活出神样子，确保没有一人要到那里。”William Booth

<br />
Matthew 23:33 – You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?

马太福音23:33--你们这些蛇类、毒蛇之种啊！怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？

##### E. Jesus raises the critical question that every sinner must face: “How can a person avoid being condemned to hell?” 耶稣对所有罪人提出了一个必须要面对的问题：“一个人怎能逃避的了地狱的审判呢？”

<br />
Matthew 7:13 – Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, an only a few find it.

马太福音 7:13--你们要进窄门。因为引到灭亡，那门是宽的，路是大的，进去的人也多；

##### F. Jesus indicates that many people, (in fact, the majority of people) will make the tragic choice to go to hell. 耶稣指明很多人（事实上是大多数人），将会可悲地选择去地狱。

<br />
Luke 12:4-5 – “I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him, who after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him.”

路加福音12:4-5---4 “我的朋友，我对你们说，那杀身体以后不能再作什么的，不要怕他们。5我要指示你们当怕的是谁；当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们，正要怕他。

Ezekiel 18:23, 32 – Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? . . . 32) For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!

以西结书18:23,32 

23主耶和华说：恶人死亡，岂是我喜悦的吗？不是喜悦他回头离开所行的道存活吗？ 

32主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。”

###### G. Jesus urges us to revere God, who is our eternal Judge. He pleads with us to repent of our sins and trust in His pardoning mercy in the Savior so that we do not go to hell. 耶稣渴望我们敬畏神--我们的永远的审判者。他为我们祷告让我们为我们的罪而悔过，信他在救主里的赦免之恩，好叫我们不去地狱。
