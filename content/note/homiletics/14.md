第十四课(Lesson＃14):应用
LESSON 14:
第十四课：
Making Applications
应用
Of the two main parts of a sermon--exposition and application--perhaps the application is the most challenging. We spend much time learning correct ways to study Scripture and derive the Spirit-intended meaning from a text. Your training in hermeneutics, and exegesis will prepare you well for teaching the exposition in the sermon. However, we cannot overlook the importance of making correct and appropriate applications of a text. Most Lutheran preachers are quite effective in explaining the meaning of the text, but often at the expense of effective applications. If your members have heard you explain the text thoroughly, they know more about the message of the Bible. But if they do not know how this affects their life, then listening to a sermon is a purely academic matter.
讲道的两个主要部分---解经和应用---也 许应用最具挑战性。我们花很多时间学习正确方法来研究圣经，并从经文中推理出属灵的意义。你的释经学的训练和解经训练将为你在讲道中解释圣经做充分的准 备。然而，我们不可忽虑正确和适当地应用经文的重要性。大多数路德派传道人在解释经文意思方面很有果效，但经常在有效应用上付出代价。如果你的信众已经听 了你彻底地解释的经文，他们明白了更多的圣经的信息。但是如果他们不懂这些信息怎样影响他们的生活的话，那么听道就是件纯粹脱离实际的事情。`
When studying a sermon text, it is important to discover textually correct applications. You should choose applications that are specific to the text, and have ‘text color.’ This is being faithful to the message of the text, and also will help you avoid repeating applications Sunday after Sunday. Consider the following texts and discover the most appropriate applications to believers today.
查考一段讲道经文时，发掘符合经文的正确应用是很重要的。你应该选择专门切合经文的应用，具有“经文风格“。这样就忠实于经文的信息，而且帮助你避免在一个接一个的星期日礼拜时重复应用。思考以下经文，发掘对今天的信徒最适当的应用。
Psalm 1 诗篇 1 篇       John 8:31-36 约翰福音8：31-36       Galatians 1:1-10   加拉太书1：1-10

In order to develop good applications, you absolutely must consider carefully who your members are, where they come from, what their day-to-day problems are, whether they are strong or weak Christians, and what their concerns and worries are. Try to put yourself in the lives of your people and understand what they are experiencing. This will avoid the ‘ivory tower’ or ‘stained glass’ syndrome that many pastors suffer from. If your members do not believe that you are in touch with their lives and problems, they will not be good listeners and may not be members of your church for long.
为 了展开有效的应用，你绝对必须仔细思考你的信众是什么人，他们从哪来，他们日常生活中的问题是什么，他们是坚强还是软弱的基督徒，以及他们关心什么和焦虑 什么。尽量让自己置身于他们的生活，理解他们正经历的。这将避免很多牧师遭遇的“象牙塔”或“有色眼镜”症状。如果你的信众不相信你和他们切身问题相关， 他们就不会是好听众，并且不会成为你的教会里长时间的信徒。
