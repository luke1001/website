第八课(Lesson＃8):为儿童和青年的讲道
LESSON 8:
第八课：
Sermons for Children and Youth
为儿童和青年的讲道


One of the challenges of writing and preaching effective sermons in the Sunday worship services is that there is always a very mixed group of listeners. Some are veteran Christians, some are new Christians, some may not be Christians at all. The group is mixed also in age groups. There will be small children, teenagers, and adults. How does the preacher address all these different people in one sermon?
为星期天的礼拜撰写有果效的讲章和进行令人印象深刻的讲道，其中一个挑战是总是有不同水平的信众混合在一起。有些是多年的信徒，有些是刚信的信徒，有些根本不是信徒。不同年龄的信徒也混合在一起。包括儿童，少年和成人。传道人如何在一篇讲道中向所有这些不同的人群致词呢？
Quite naturally, the Sunday sermon is written primarily for adults and well-established Christians. Usually the majority of listeners will fit this category. But the sermon should not be written and preached exclusively for this group. Our concern in this lesson is with children and youth. Sometimes a large percentage of the attendance in church on Sunday will consist of children and youth. Sermons can and should be preached with them in mind.
很自然，星期天讲章主要针对成人和资深信徒而写。通常大多数信众符合这一类。但是讲章不应专为他们所写和宣讲。我们本课关注的是儿童和青年。有时候星期天教会里占出席人数很大比例的是儿童和青年。讲道可以也应该传达到他们心里。
In order to effectively preach to children, we need to keep in mind the ways in which children learn and remember lessons. Perhaps the least effective means of teaching children is by simply telling them something, which is what the average sermon does. If we are going to reach children, we need to go beyond that.
为了有效地向儿童传道，我们需要记住儿童学习和记忆的方法。也许教导儿童最低效的方法是通过仅仅告诉的方式，这是通常的讲道方式。如果我们要和孩子们交流，我们要超越这种方式。
Children learn by: 儿童学习通过：
*Using their senses--by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching.
Use visual aids, sounds, objects and other items to teach children. Use pictures and vivid illustrations. A flannelboard or white board can be useful.
*用他们的感官---通过看，听，闻，尝，摸。
用视觉帮助，声音，物体和其他东西教他们。用图画和生动的举例。法兰绒板或白板会很有用 。
*Doing 动手
Have the children participate in some activity as you are teaching them. You may not be able to involve all of them, but take a couple of volunteers.
当你教他们时，让他们参与活动。你可能无法让他们全部参加，挑几个志愿者。
*Repetition, recitation, memorization. 重复，背诵，记忆。
When teaching children, we need to have one major lesson that we repeat, perhaps have them repeat and memorize.
教儿童时，我们需要有一个重复的主要教导，或许让他们复述和记忆。
*Illustrations 例证
Use stories to illustrate the main lesson.
用故事来说明主要教导。
With this in mind, you may want to write and preach a sermon that will include visual aids, stories for illustrations, etc.
记住这些，你也许想写一篇讲章并做一个包括借助视觉工具，以故事举例，等等方式的讲道。
There are also other forums outside of the worship service in which you can preach and teach a lesson to children:
在礼拜之外还有其他讨论会你可以给孩子传道，教导他们。
*children’s lessons in the worship service, which is particularly useful because you can gather the children together in the sanctuary and develop a message just for them.
*礼拜上对孩子的教导尤其重要，因为你能在教会把孩子们聚在一起，并专为他们传播信息。
*children’s worship services. When you have a larger number of children you can plan and present an entire worship service just for the children. This would include items from the liturgy that are reworded for the children.
*儿童礼拜。当孩子人数很多时，你可以为他们计划和呈现一个完整的礼拜。这将包括为孩子重述礼拜仪式条款。
*dramatic presentations of Bible stories, which can be done in Bible class/Sunday school, children’s services, Vacation Bible School, and fellowship events.
*生动陈述圣经故事，可以在圣经课/主日学，儿童礼拜，假期圣经学校，团契活动上完成。
When you gather a number of children together for lessons, it may be helpful to recruit a Sunday school teacher to help in case of disciplinary problems!
当你聚集很多孩子进行教导时，招募一位主日学老师以防出现纪律问题会很有帮助。
Many of these same principles apply to youth and teenagers. We might also add that youth generally respond well to interactive sermons, and to a touch of humor in sermons. You might also consider including your youth in children’s
Programs. They will learn while they are helping to present and teach.
这些相同的原则中有很多适用于青少年。我们可以补充的是青少年通常对交互式讲道，对略带幽默的讲道反映很好。你可以考虑让青少年参与加入儿童节目。他们在帮助传道和教导儿童时将有所学习。
