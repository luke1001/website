节期讲道和特别事工讲道

Festival Sermons
节期讲道
During the course of the church year, there are festivals which naturally require a special festival sermon. These may be considered to be specific kinds of topical sermons. Like all sermons, they should be expository and textual. Church festivals require that the preacher strive to capture the spirit of that festival in his sermon, and that he deliver a message that has meaning for the lives of the people. It is a helpful idea to read through some of the festival hymns in order to find the spirit of a festival. Such festivals include:
教会年历中有些节日要求特别的节期讲道。这些被认为是特殊类型的专题讲道。像所有的讲道一样，他们应该是解释圣经式和经文式的讲道。教会节日讲道要求讲道者务必紧抓相应节日的精神，传讲对人们生活有意义的信息。为了抓住节日的精神通读一些节日赞美诗很有帮助。这些节日包括：
1. Harvest/Thanksgiving 丰收/感恩节
2. Christmas 圣诞节
3. New Year 新年
4. Easter 复活节
1. Harvest/Thanksgiving    丰收/ 感恩节
The name indicates the spirit and attitude of the festival--thanksgiving. The goal for the preacher in his sermon and worship service is to build in the hearts of the listeners an attitude of appreciation and gratefulness for God’s many blessings. This means trying to show the members what God has done for them both in spiritual and physical ways. It is not extremely difficult to remind people of physical blessings, because they can see and touch and taste those blessings. More difficult is helping people to appreciate their spiritual blessings, which are less tangible. The preacher needs to awaken people out of their habit of complaining about their problems, out of a spirit of dissatisfaction or discontent, out of an attitude of ‘taking everything for granted.’
节日名字就表明了节日的精神和宗旨---感恩。传道人在讲道和做礼拜时目的是在信众心里建立感激和感恩的态度，感谢神丰富的祝福。这意味着要尽力向信徒展示神在物质和灵性方面为他们所做的。提醒人们物质上的赐福不是很难，因为他们能看见，触摸和体会得到这些祝福。更难的是如何帮助人们领会无形的、难以触摸的灵性的祝福。传道人需要把他们从习惯于凡事抱怨、不满足、不满意、对神的恩典习以为常的精神状态中唤醒。

2. Christmas    圣诞节
The challenge in this festival is to brush aside all the distractions and other activities associated with this season and get to the heart and core of what we celebrate as Christians--the humble birth of our Savior. The spirit and attitude which the preacher wants to nurture in his people is a combination of repentance and joy. Jesus would not have been born in Bethlehem if we were not sinners in need of salvation. So to celebrate Christmas requires that we carefully examine our hearts and lives, and reach the repentant conclusion that we would be lost without a Savior (Law). Then we are ready to truly appreciate the great gift which our God gave us--his Son as our Redeemer (Gospel).

圣诞节讲道的挑战是要无视与圣诞节有关的娱乐或其他活动，直奔我们作为基督徒庆祝圣诞的核心---我们救主谦卑的降生。传道人想要培养人们持有悔改和喜乐相结合的精神和态度。如果我们不是需要拯救的罪人，耶稣就不会降生在伯利恒。所以要庆祝圣诞，我们要仔细审察自己的内心和生命，得出悔改的结论：没有救主，我们将迷失（律法）。然后我们准备由衷地感激神赐给我们的美好礼物---他的儿子为我们的救主（福音）
Sermon Texts: every sermon for Christmas should really be based on Luke 2:1-20, which is the Christmas story. It is a mistake to try to creatively choose a different sermon text and tie it in to the festival. Other Scripture readings which may be used for the service:
讲道经文：每篇为圣诞节的讲道应该根据路加福音2:1-20的关于圣诞节的故事。试图创意性地选择不同讲道经文，使其与这个节日关联是错误的。其他可以在做圣诞礼拜时使用的读经。
Isaiah 9:1-7 以赛亚书 9:1-7
Isaiah 11:1-9 以赛亚书 11:1-9
Isaiah 60:1-7 以赛亚书 60:1-7
Micah 5:2 弥迦书 5：2
Matthew 1:18-25 马太福音1:18-25
John 1:1-18 约翰福音1:1-18
Hebrews 1:1-9 希伯来书1:1-9
3. New Year   新年
The new year festival may be typically celebrated with parties. There is a strong message that the preacher can deliver at the beginning of a new year. The spirit of the Christian at this time is one of reflection. It is a good time to look back over the past year to give thanks for the Lord’s guidance and blessings, to humbly repent of our failures and mistakes, to remember our loved ones who have died over the year, and to recognize the changes that come into our lives regularly. New Year is also a good time to look ahead to the future in order to pray and trust in the Lord’s promised blessings, fight the temptation to worry but rather trust in God’s protection and providence, and rededicate ourselves to leading a God-pleasing life (spiritual ‘resolutions’).
新年常以聚会方式庆祝。传道人在新年之初可以传递一个重要信息。此时基督徒的精神是回顾。这是一个很好的时刻来回顾过去的一年，感谢神的带领和祝福，谦卑地忏悔我们的失败和过失，纪念这年里离世的亲人，并不断认识到我们生命中的变化。新年也是我们展望未来好时机，我们祷告和信靠神的应许，与试探争斗，不是去忧虑，而是相信神的保守和眷顾，再次投身于神喜悦的生命（ 属灵“决志”）
There are a wide variety of possible sermon texts for New Year, depending on what you are going to emphasize in the sermon. Some common texts:
适合新年的传道经文选择性很广，取决于你在讲道中要强调的内容。以下是常用的经文：
Joshua 1:1-9 约书亚书 1:1-9
Psalm 90:1-12 诗篇 90:1-12
Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 传道书 3:1-8

*Choose a sermon text for Christmas and for New Year, identify the main ideas, and develop a basic outline with applications. . .
选择适合圣诞和新年的一段讲道经文，确定中心思想，并发展成一篇结合应用的基本大纲。

4. Easter    复活节
More than any other festival, the spirit of Easter is one of joy and victory. The victory that Christ won for us over Satan and death and hell is clearly demonstrated by his resurrection from the dead on Easter. The challenge for the preacher is to exemplify and convey the spirit of joy and excitement that every Christian should rightly feel when celebrating Easter. This is a festival of LIFE--a new life for us on earth, spiritual life with forgiveness of sins, and eternal life in heaven. We want to impress upon our people how the truth of Jesus’ resurrection changes our lives today--it fills our lives with joy and hope. We live each day for a risen Savior, who now rules our lives from his throne in heaven. We also want to impress upon our people how our view of death is changed, both our own death and the death of Christian family and friends.
复活节充满喜乐和胜利的精神更胜其他节日。耶稣基督为我们战胜撒旦，死亡，地狱的胜利在复活节因他从死里复活向我们彰显。对于传道人的挑战是证明和传达在庆祝复活节时每位基督徒应该正确地感受这种喜乐和兴奋。 这是生命的节日---我们在世上的新生命，罪得赦免的属灵生命和天国的永生。我们想让人们深刻认识到耶稣复活的事实如何改变我们今天的生活---它使我们的生活充满喜乐和盼望。我们每天为复活的救主而活，他现在在天国的王座上掌管我们的生命。我们也想让人们深刻认识到我们对死亡的态度如何改变，包括对我们自己的死亡及基督徒家人和朋友的死亡。
Sermon Texts: similar to Christmas, every sermon text for Easter should be based on one of the Gospel accounts of the resurrection. The Easter morning accounts are found in. . .

5. Confirmation    坚信礼
When young people are confirmed in their Christian faith after a period of catechism instruction, the church typically has a special confirmation service to recognize their step forward in their spiritual lives. The purpose for this special service is to give to the confirmands the opportunity to publicly confess their faith to their fellow church members. A second purpose is to receive the confirmands into communicant membership in the church.
年轻人在经过一段时间教义问答指导后，当他们坚定了基督教信仰时，教会会为他们特别举行坚信礼仪式来认可他们属灵生命的进步。这个特殊仪式的目的是给接受坚信礼者向教会团契的信徒公开承认自己的信仰。第二个目的是接受坚信礼者获得在教会领圣餐的资格。
The preacher prepares a special confirmation sermon for this service, which is directed primarily to the confirmands, but also has a message for all the other members. The confirmation sermon can focus on any one of a number of themes. . .
传道人要为这个仪式准备一个特别的坚信礼讲道，不仅直接针对接受坚信礼者，而且向其他所有信徒传达一个信息。坚信礼讲道可以集中于许多主题中的任何一个。
The Triune God--Father, Son and Holy Spirit--and their work in our lives.
三位一体的神--圣父、圣子和圣灵--和他们在我们生命里做工。
Faith and how the Holy Spirit creates and strengthens faith.
信心和圣灵如何创造和加固信心。
The Means of Grace as the tool by which we come to faith and are strengthened in it.
恩典之道作为给引领我们信仰并加固我们信心的工具。
Christian dedication and faithfulness in worshiping, studying the Word, receiving the sacrament.
在做礼拜，学习圣经，领圣餐时基督徒的奉献和忠诚。
Christian dedication to serving the Lord and the church.
基督徒服侍神和教会的奉献
The preacher has a great deal of freedom in choosing Scripture readings and a sermon text for confirmation. Look for examples in the Bible of believers who demonstrated and expressed faithfulness to God.
传道人有很大自由选择适合坚信礼的读经和讲道经文。寻找圣经中信徒向神证明和表达忠诚的的例子。

6. Funeral    葬礼
When a member of the congregation dies, the pastor usually makes arrangements for a funeral service in the church. There are some occasions when the funeral may be conducted in a funeral home. This can be a very busy and stressful time for the preacher! He needs to take care of many matters in a relatively short time. The pastor will want to spend time with the family members, providing comfort and guidance from God’s Word at home. He may also need to help with some of the funeral home arrangements, as well as the funeral service at church. This may also be a very emotional time, not only for the family members, but also for the pastor. Sometimes the circumstances of the death are extraordinarily difficult--sudden death in an accident, or the death of a child. It is a good idea to do some general, advance planning for funerals.
当一个教会成员去世时，牧师通常在教堂安排追思礼拜。有些场合葬礼会在殡仪馆举行。这对传道人是非常繁忙和有压力的时刻。他需要在相对很短时间内照顾很多事情。牧师需要和死者家属一起，在家中让他们从神的话语中得到安慰和带领。他还要帮助殡仪馆葬礼的安排，还有在教堂的追思礼拜。这也是一个令人情绪激动的时刻，不仅对于死者家属，也对于牧师。有时死亡情况极其凄惨--事故中突发死亡，或儿童夭折。为葬礼作一些常规的，预先的计划是个好主意。
The spirit and tone of the funeral service for a Christian is always one of victory and confidence, even joy on the occasion of a Christian reaching eternal life in heaven. But there is also a second consideration--the grief and loss suffered by the family. God’s Word declares joy for the believer who enters heaven, and comfort for those who are grieving and left behind. The preacher should also remember that a funeral is often an excellent evangelism opportunity, as there may be visitors who are not Christians, or very inactive Christians.
在信徒被接回天国，进入永生的时候，基督徒追思礼拜的精神和主调总是赋予胜利和信心，甚至喜乐。但仍要加以考虑----死者家人所承受的悲痛和损失。神的话语为进入天国的信徒宣告喜乐，并安慰那些留在世间的悲伤的人。传道人应该记住葬礼经常提供传讲福音的好机会，因为参加葬礼的人中有些是非信徒，或不积极的信徒。

There is a comprehensive list of appropriate Scripture readings and sermon texts in the front of the hymnal, pages 148-149. You may also want to consult with the family regarding favorite Bible passages that they may want included in the service. Not surprisingly, most Easter readings would be very fitting for a funeral service.
在赞美诗集前面有适合读经和讲道经文的全面的目录，148-149页。你也可以征求死者家属想在葬礼仪式上使用他们最喜欢的圣经章节。不出所料，大多数复活节读经都很适合葬礼仪式。
Choose some Scripture readings, a sermon text, and sermon outline with main ideas.
选择一些诵读的经文，一段讲道经文，和带有主题的讲道大纲。

7. Wedding    婚礼
When a couple becomes engaged and informs their pastor about their future plans to be married, the pastor will meet with the couple a number of times for premarital counseling first. During these classes the pastor will discuss details regarding the wedding ceremony. There are numerous details to take care of, including Scripture readings, and a sermon text.
当一对恋人订婚并告知他们的牧师结婚计划，牧师就要为他们进行多次婚前辅导。在辅导时牧师将和他们讨论婚礼仪式的细节。会有大量细节要考虑，包括读经和一段讲道经文。
The wedding service is a joyful time for the couple to express publicly their love and dedication to each other, but also an important time to remember that their marriage is based upon Christ, and their love for each other is a reflection of the kind of selfless, self-sacrificing love that the Savior has shown to us. Too often the attendants at a wedding ceremony are not concerned about the spiritual aspects of this service, but are anxious to party. Like a funeral, a wedding ceremony is also an excellent occasion for evangelism work as there are often people in attendance for a wedding ceremony who seldom if ever attend church otherwise.
婚礼仪式不仅是个快乐地时刻，新人当众表达对彼此的爱，委身对方；而且是个重要的时刻， 记住他们的婚姻是基于基督，他们对彼此的爱正是救主展现给我们的一种无私，自我牺牲的爱的投射。参加婚礼的人经常不关心仪式的灵性层面，只盼望婚宴。和葬礼一样，婚礼也是一个很好的传福音的场合，因为参加婚礼的人经常会有很少甚至从不去教堂的人。
The wedding sermon should, for this reason, still have a strong dose of law and gospel for everyone in attendance. The sermon should also have law for the couple becoming married so that they have the realistic understanding that their marriage relationship, no matter how strong, will still be infected by sin and all the problems that come with it. So the gospel message in the sermon should emphasize forgiveness for one another as well as love. Like a funeral sermon, the wedding sermon can rightly incorporate some personal references to the married couple--their characteristics, religious background, hobbies, etc. But these references are part of the applications in the sermon, and not the main subject for preaching!
为了这个缘故，婚礼讲道应该给每位参加婚礼的人传递大量的律法和福音信息。讲道也要对已婚夫妇传达律法的信息，让他们对婚姻关系有切合实际的理解：无论婚姻多牢固，仍然会受到罪和随之而来的诸多问题的影响。所以讲道中福音信息要强调既要彼此宽恕 又要彼此相爱。和葬礼讲道一样，婚礼讲道可以适当地结合新人的个人信息---他们的性格特点，宗教背景，爱好，等等。但这些参照信息作为讲道中的应用部分，不是讲道的主题。
There is an order for the wedding service on pages 140-143 in the front of the hymnal.
在赞美诗集前面140-143页有婚礼仪式的程序
There are many different possibilities for sermon texts for weddings. Any text that deals with Christian love and dedication would be suitable. Some of the more common choices for wedding sermon texts are. . .
