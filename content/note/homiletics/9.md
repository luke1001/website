第九课(Lesson＃9):传道人的预备
LESSON 9:
第九课：
Preparing the Preacher
传道人的预备
As you begin the process of writing a sermon, it is valuable to prepare yourself as a Christian before preparing yourself as a speaker. You are not simply delivering a speech on a subject that does not mean that much to you. You are not reading an essay or a poem or a newspaper article. You are proclaiming the saving message of Jesus Christ as a person who has himself been redeemed and brought to faith in the Savior. You as a preacher are still a sinner who needs to confess his sins, hear the message of forgiveness, and rejoice in the peace of forgiveness. Your preparation of a sermon begins here.
当你开始撰写讲章的过程，在你预备自己成为一名演讲者之前，先要预备自己为一名基督徒，这是非常重要的。你不是仅在发表一个对自己没什么意义的讲演。你不是在读一篇论文，一首诗或一篇新闻。你是作为一个被救赎并被带领信主的人在宣讲耶稣基督救恩的信息。你作为一个传道人仍然是个罪人，需为罪悔改，听神宽恕的信息，并在罪得赦免的平安中欢喜。你讲道的预备从这开始。
A suggested step-by-step preparation:
建议循序渐进的预备：
1. Pray before reading your sermon text. Pray for the Lord’s guidance and blessing on your study.
在读讲道经文之前祷告。祷告求神的带领和祝福你的研究。
2. Read the sermon text, first for yourself. What does this mean to me? What message do I get out of this? Look for Law and Gospel. Examine the Law and let it strike your heart to lead you to repentance. Find the Gospel message and rejoice in the blessings of forgiveness through Christ. Pray again over your repentance and forgiveness.
首先给自己朗读讲道经文。它对我有什么意义？我从中得到什么信息？寻找律法和福音信息。查考其中的律法并让它鞭策你的内心，引导你悔改。找到福音的信息，为因基督的赦免而得的祝福而欢喜。再次为你的悔改和基督的赦免祷告。
3. Read the sermon text again, putting yourself in the shoes of your members. Remember the challenges and problems your members have. Remember their level of spiritual maturity. Remember what their background and life’s story has been. Read through the sermon text and find the message for your members, which is often the same message you found for yourself. Identify the main points. Pray again for the Lord to bless your preparations for the spiritual benefit of your members.
再次朗读讲道经文，使自己处于你的教会的信徒的位置。记住他们面对的挑战和问题。记住他们灵性的成熟的程度。记住他们所经历的背景和人生故事。通读讲道经文，并找到适合他们的信息，这经常是你为自己找的相同信息。确定主旨。再次祷告求神祝福你为教会信徒灵性的受益所做的预备
4. Proceed with the steps that are outlined in the following lessons.
继续进行以下教导中概述的步奏 ：
STUDY THE SERMON TEXT FOR YOURSELF FIRST.
先为自己查考讲道的经文。
PREACH THE SERMON TO YOURSELF FIRST.
先向自己讲道
(If your sermon does not do anything for you spiritually, it probably won’t do anything for your members either!)
如果你的讲道不能对自己有灵性的果效，很可能对你的信众也没有果效！
