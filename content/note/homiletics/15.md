第十五课(Lesson＃15):导论
LESSON 15:
第十五课
Writing Introductions
导论

The purpose for the introduction of a sermon is really twofold—
一篇讲章的导论的目的的确是两方面的----
1. Introduce the main idea from God’s Word that you will be preaching about, which leads into the theme.
引出你将传讲的神的道的主要思想，引进命题。
2. Grab the listeners’ attention and interest.
紧抓信众的注意力和兴趣。
The introduction should normally be short--no more than 10 or 15% of the sermon. There may be occasions when you do not use an introduction at all because it would seem forced or superficial. For example, a funeral or wedding sermon, or even a sermon for Good Friday or Easter.
导论通常应该简短---不超过讲章的10 or 15%的长度。可能有些场合你根本不需要导论因为会看上去牵强和表面化。比如说，一个追思或婚礼讲道，甚至基督受难日或复活节的讲道。
There are a wide variety of ways to introduce the sermon, and the preacher should be diligent in using different methods so that he does not become completely predictable and boring with his introductions. Give special attention to the first sentence that you say. Some possibilities for introductions. . .
有各种各样的方法来引导一篇讲章，传道人应该积极的使用这些不同的方法，这样他不会让人感到完全在意料之中并对他的导论感到乏味。尤其重视要说的开场句 。可供导论的选择有：
1. Incorporating some element of the season (summer, winter, or Lent, Thanksgiving).
结合一些季节因素（夏天，冬天，或四旬节，感恩节）
2. Borrowing from major news stories and events.
借用重要的新闻故事和事件
3. Using a story from history.
采用历史故事
4. Telling a story from your own life (but be careful), or someone else’s life.
讲述个人生活经历（但需谨慎），或别人的故事
5. Identifying a common need or problem in our lives.
确定一个我们生活中共同的需要或问题。
6. Raising questions that are on the minds of your people.
提出信众心中的问题。
7. Illustrations or demonstrations of the truth you are teaching. This could include a video clip, or a dramatic skit.
举例或证明你教导的真理。这可以包括视频片段，或戏剧小品。
Some cautions are important to keep in mind. . .
记住一些重要警告：
1. Do not jump into an application of the Biblical truth in your introduction, as that will be coming later in your sermon.
不要在导论中就进入对圣经原理的应用，因为那是在讲道后
部分进行。
2. Make sure your stories in the introduction clearly lead to the theme and main ideas of your sermon.
确信导论中的故事能清楚地通向讲道的命题和主要思想。
3. Be careful in using stories from your own life, because it can have a negative effect (the pastor is always talking about himself).
谨慎使用自己的生活故事，因为它可能会有负面影响（这个牧师总是在谈论自己）
4. Do not slip into the ‘ivory tower’ syndrome in your introductions. For example, “Someone came into my office this week and asked, ‘Pastor, what about. . .’” Not only is your life as a pastor somewhat foreign to your members, but they may become uncomfortable coming to you with anything, worried that they will appear in your next sermon!
你的导论中不要出现“象牙塔”症状。比如，“有人这周到我的办公室问“牧师，。。。怎么样？” 不仅是因为你作为牧师的生活和信徒有些距离，而且他们担心你下次讲道提到他们，有事到你跟前时可能会变得不自在，。
5. Do not refer to what you are going to tell them in ‘this sermon.’
不要提及在你“本次讲道”中将要告诉他们的内容。
