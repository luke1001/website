第十九课(Lesson＃19):讲道的语音表达
LESSON 19:
第十九课：
The Voice in Preaching
讲道的语音表达

A sermon requires not only careful preparation in exegesis, outlining, and development of thoughts, but also a skillful verbal delivery. Many sermons that are outstanding written papers are poorly delivered and so fall flat. When the preacher writes a sermon, he should always remember that this will be spoken to a group of people who do not have the written manuscript in front of them. There is a gigantic difference between the written word and the spoken word.
一篇讲道不仅要求仔细准备解经，大纲，和周密思考，而且需要有技巧的口头表达。很多讲道虽然文稿写得很优秀却陈述乏味，因而达不到预期效果。当传道人拟写奖章时，他应该总是记住这是面对一群手中没有讲章文稿的人发言。书面语和口语之间有着巨大的区别。

Some general rules to keep in mind about the spoken word compared to the written word. . .
记住一些关于口语和书面语比较的普遍规则......
1. A sermon should generally use shorter sentences than you would write in an essay.
一篇讲道通常应该使用的句子比你写论文的句子短。
2. A sermon should avoid using long, technical vocabulary, unless the preacher clearly explains terms.
一篇讲道应该避免使用冗长且技术型词汇，除非传道人清楚地解释这些术语。
3. More difficult, heavy, doctrinal sections of a sermon should be preached more slowly to allow hearers to absorb and comprehend the message. Remember that your listeners do not have you on videotape so that they can rewind and listen to a section a couple of times to get the meaning. They also do not have a written manuscript which they can read more slowly through difficult sections.
一篇讲道中较难的，繁琐的，学术性的部分应该讲解得更慢从而让信众吸收和理解讲道的信息。记住这些信众 没有你讲道的录像带好让他们能倒带多听几次，明白意思。他们也没有书面讲稿让他们在难懂的部分可以更慢阅读。
4. A sermon should use pictures and illustrations more than you would use in a written paper.
一篇讲道应该比你写篇论文使用更多的描述和举例。
5. Sermons should repeat major thoughts and ideas so that the listeners do not miss your point.
讲道应该重复主要思想和概念，因此信众不会漏掉要点。
6. A sermon has the added advantage of audio and visual aids--the listeners can see your face, hand gestures, and posture, and hear your voice in proclaiming the message.
一篇讲道已经赋予音频和视频帮助的优势---信众能看见你的面容表情，手势，身体姿势，并且听见你宣讲信息的声音。
The voice is an instrument which the preacher uses to convey his message, and should be used to its maximum benefit. There are several variations in the voice to be aware of and used. Here are some of the key variations and ideas on how to use them.
声音是传道人用于传达信息的工具，并且应该使用到极致。要注意和使用声音中的几个变化。下面是一些关键的变化和如何使用他们的要领。
1. Intensity/Volume   声调/ 音量
-the voice can be loud, normal, or soft. You can use a louder voice in proclaiming God’s Law, which demands obedience. You remember the sounds that accompanied God’s giving his Law to Moses on Mt. Sinai. A louder voice can also be used in application portions of your sermon when you are calling your people to action, trying to motivate them for Christian living. The voice may be softer in order to convey gentler, heartfelt messages. The message of the Gospel, of God’s love for sinners, should be preached in a normal or softer tone. If you are calling your listeners to think or contemplate some question or teaching, a softer tone is appropriate. Be careful in using a softer tone of voice so that you can still be heard by your members.
声音可以响亮，正常，或轻柔。你在宣讲神要求人顺服的律法时可以声音宏亮。你记住神在西奈山向摩西颁律法的声音。当你号召大家积极行动，努力激发他们活出基督的生命时，你可以在讲道的应用部分使用宏亮的声音。为了传达温柔，真诚的信息，声音可以轻柔。福音的信息，是神对罪人的爱的信息，应该用正常，或轻柔的语调讲述。如果你呼吁信众去想或沉思一些问题或教训，适合用更轻柔的语调。要小心使用更轻柔的语调，从而让信众仍然能听见你的声音。

2. Pitch (high or low tone)   音调（高或低调）
-your voice is capable of higher and lower pitches. When you are relaxed, the tone of your voice is naturally lower. The majority of a sermon should be preached at a naturally lower, relaxed tone. You may move to a higher tone of voice in sections of the sermon that contain a higher level of emotion. There are two warnings in place regarding the pitch of your voice. Use a pitch that comes naturally, otherwise you sound overly dramatic. NEVER get stuck in a monotone.
你的嗓音能高能低。当你放松时，你的声音自然偏低音。一篇讲道大部分应该使用自然的低音，放松的音调。你可以在讲道的中情绪激昂的部分提高嗓音。关于声音的音调有两点告诫。使用自然的音调，否则你会听起来过分戏剧性。永远不要停留在单一的音调里。

3. Speed, Pauses   语 速，停顿
-you can speak in varying speeds--slow, medium, and fast. We do so naturally in our conversations, depending on the circumstances. We speak more slowly when we are discussing a matter that requires a lot of thought, or are trying to teach someone. We speak faster when we are excited or trying to motivate others to action. A sermon should include various speeds of delivery.
你可以以不同语速 讲话---慢速，中速，和快速。我们在说话时根据情况自然运用语速。当我们在讨论一个要求认真思考的问题或是要教导别人时我们语速更慢。当我们很兴奋或努力激发别人行动时，我们语速更快。一篇讲道应该包括各种语速的表达。
-the beginning and end of the sermon should be slower. You are easing your listeners in and out of the sermon. Major doctrinal portions of your sermon should be preached more slowly, and with carefully used pauses, because you are teaching your people important truths that they do not want to miss. In narrative sections of your sermon, including story-telling, you may use a faster speed of delivery. Also more emotional, and motivational portions of your sermon may be preached at a higher speed.
讲道开场和结束时语速应该较慢。你要让信众在整个听道过程中容易听懂。讲道中主要的教义部分应该讲得较慢，并且小心地使用停顿，因为你是在教导信众不想错过的重要的真理。在你讲道的叙述部分，包括讲故事，可以用较快的语速表达。同样更感人，激发性的部分，可以用更快的语速表达。
Expression refers to the heartfelt communication of a sermon. You are not merely reciting a memorized speech when you preach a sermon. You should express the harshness in the Law, the tenderness of the Gospel, the excitement of being children of God, the urgency to share God’s Word with others. The preacher should be preaching from his heart, not just from his mind. Think about what you are saying. Think about what you are reading from the Bible. What emotions does the message work in your heart and in the hearts of your hearers? How would the original speaker have conveyed the words?
表达到位是指一篇讲道的真诚的沟通。讲道时你不是仅在背诵一篇演讲。你应该表达出律法的严酷，福音的亲切，作为神的孩子的兴奋，和与他人分享神的道的迫切。传道人应该发自内心地讲道，而不仅来自大脑。思考你在讲的话。思考你正读的经文。这些信息在你的心里，和在信众心里激起什么样的感触？试想这位最初的讲演者曾经是怎样传达这些话语的？
Diction refers to the clear pronunciation of words, so that the listeners do not have to guess what you are saying. Your words should be easy to understand because the listeners do not have a written manuscript to follow along. Remember the last letter in a word. This should not be overdone, however.
发音是指清晰的吐词发音，因此信众不用猜测你讲的话。你的用词应该易懂因为信众没有讲稿参照。记住一个词中的最后一个字母。但不应过分加重语调。
