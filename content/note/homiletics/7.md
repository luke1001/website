第七课(Lesson＃7):互动式的讲道
LESSON 7:
第七课：
Interactive Sermons
交互式讲道

An interactive sermon might best be described as a combination sermon and Bible class. The pastor is preaching a sermon, but also allows the opportunity to ask questions and discuss important lessons and applications. This kind of sermon can work well in a small group only.
一个交互式讲道可能最好的形容是讲道和圣经班的联合。虽然牧师正在讲道，但同样给学生机会提问和讨论重要的教训和应用。此种讲道对于小规模的团体讲道效果较好。
In preparing this type of sermon, the preacher should develop some questions that he may want to ask the congregation at certain points in the sermon in order to reinforce important points. Asking questions during the sermon might be a little intimidating to the members of the congregation, who are afraid to speak publicly because they might give a wrong answer. The preacher can help to relieve that fear by bringing the questions up in Bible class before the sermon is preached, and even speaking to individual members about the answers to these questions, and encouraging them to speak up in the sermon. Your questions need not be only on facts and lessons from the text, but also in the area of applications. This is an area in which your members may be more comfortable responding to questions because there is less chance that they will give a wrong answer.
预备此类讲道时，为了加强重点，传道人讲道时应在某些点上展开提问。讲道时提问可能会让那些害怕当众发言的信众胆怯，因为害怕会说错答案。传道人可以通过讲道之前在圣经课上先提出这些问题来消除害怕心理，甚至告诉个别成员这些问题的答案，并鼓励他们在听道时发言。你的问题必需不仅是从经文而来的事实和教训，而且也是关于应用领域。这个领域让你的信众回答问题会更放松，因为说错的可能性较小。
You may also pause at the end of each part of an interactive sermon to allow your members the chance to ask questions of the preacher about main points that have been made. This can be very helpful in making sure the lessons from your sermon text are getting through and are being understood.
你在交互式讲道每部分结束时可以暂停一下，给信众机会向传道人对已阐述的要点提问。这是很有帮助的，可以保证你的讲道经文中的教训正顺利传达和被信徒理解。
The advantages of having some interaction in a sermon is that it keeps your members closely focused on what you are saying, because they know questions are coming! It also can be helpful in making the sermons more educational, especially on difficult theological points from the Bible. We often are left wondering whether our members really ‘got the point’ after we have preached a sermon. This kind of sermon can help us be sure they did.
在讲道中进行互动的优点是使信众专注于你的讲道，因为他们知道你会提问！这也有助于使讲道更有教育性，尤其是对圣经里难以理解的神学知识。我们常在讲道后怀疑信众是否真的“明白了要点”。这种讲道帮助我们确信他们明白了。
The challenges of an interactive sermon include the possibility of your members ‘freezing up’ when you ask them questions, or when you invite them to ask you questions. You can help to prevent this by speaking with your members in Bible class, or ‘setting up’ some members in the congregation ahead of time. Another challenge is that if your members respond with interaction, you can get off track from the main points of your sermon, and lose some control in a worship atmosphere.
交互式讲道的挑战包括当你对信众提问或请他们向你提问时，他们可能表现呆板。你可以通过先在圣经课上与他们沟通，或提前对一些信徒“演示” 来预防这种状况发生。另一个挑战是如果信众进行互动，你可能会游离讲道的要点，在敬拜的气氛中失去控制局面。
