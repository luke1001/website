第十七课(Lesson＃17):讲道评估
LESSON 17:
第十七课：
Evaluating the Sermon
讲道评估

One of the more difficult jobs for a preacher is to evaluate his sermons after preaching them.  We generally like to ‘leave it alone’ after it has been preached, and not think much more about it.  But there is great value in spending some time to evaluate how effective the sermon was, and learn lessons for improving sermons in the future.   
对于传道人来说，其中一个最困难的工作就是讲道后评估自己的讲道。我们通常喜欢讲完道后就把它放在一边，不去多加思考。但是花时间评估讲道的效果如何，并为改进未来的讲道而吸取教训，这是非常有价值的。
Who should evaluate the sermon?  The simple answer--the preacher himself.  Obviously, we care about how the members evaluate what we preach.  Some members are in the habit of giving you a little commentary about your sermon (“That was really interesting!”  “You had some good humor in this one.”  “That was kind of long and boring.”) But the fact is that your members have not been trained to properly evaluate a sermon, and do not know what the key elements of a good sermon are.  You may want to train your wife (be careful) or one of the elders of your congregation (better idea) in how to evaluate your sermons.  Then meet with that person regularly to receive input on how effective the sermon was.  You may also want to train your confirmation students in how to listen to a sermon and find the main points in it.  Many pastors ask their confirmation students to write a summary of 6-12 sermons during the course of the school year and hand in their summary to the pastor.  
谁应该评估讲道呢？答案就是---传道人自己。很显然，我们在乎信众如何评价我们的讲道。有些信徒习惯性地对你的讲道做一点评价（“真的很有意思！”“你在这个讲道中很有幽默感。”“有点长和令人乏味。”）
但事实是你的信众还没能训练有素地正确评价一篇讲道，也不知道一篇好的讲道的关键因素是什么。你可以训练你的妻子（要谨慎）或教会的一位长老（好主意）怎样来评估你的讲道。然后定期和他会面，接受关于你的讲道果效的评论。你也可以训练你的将接受坚信礼的学生如何听道和找到其中要点。很多牧师要求他们的接受坚信礼的学生在一学年课程中写6至12篇讲道的概要并把概要递交给牧师。

Ultimately, the preacher himself, or fellow pastors, are in the best position to evaluate a sermon.  If at all possible, this evaluation should be done with audiotape or, even better, with a videotape of the sermon.  When evaluating the content of the sermon (we will consider the delivery of a sermon in upcoming lessons), check several important factors.  Most of these are a review from Lesson 13 on developing the sermon. . .
最终，传道人自己，或同道的牧师，是评估一篇讲道的最佳人选。如果可能的话，将评估制成录音磁带，或者，甚至更好的办法是附上这篇讲道的录音带。当评价讲道的内容时（我们将在即将学习的课程中考虑讲道的表达效果），检查几个重要因素。大部分因素是对13课关于讲道的展开的回顾......

1. Is there a clear presentation of both Law and Gospel in the sermon, with emphasis on the Gospel?
这篇讲道中关于律法和福音有一个清晰的陈述吗，并在福音的信息上进行强调吗？
2. Is there a balance between exposition and application, and between the major parts of the sermon?
解经和应用的关系平衡吗？讲道的主要段落之间平衡吗？
3. Is there one main point that came across clearly and memorably?
有没有一个要点，阐述清楚并且令人记忆深刻？
4. Do the illustrations and stories clearly teach a message?
所用的例证和故事能清楚地教导一个信息吗？
5. Are theological terms properly explained?
神学术语解释得正确吗？
6. Are the applications up-to-date and specific?
应用部分是最新的，确切的吗？
7. Does the sermon fit into the occasion and fit the audience?
这篇讲道符合时机和适合观众吗？
8. Is the sermon too long or too short?
这篇讲道太长还是太短？  
9. Is there too much repetition in the sermon?
这篇讲道中有太多重复吗？
10. Are you slipping into the same habits for introduction, conclusion?
你在导论和结论中有没有沿袭同样的习惯。
