第二十二-二十六课(Lesson＃22-26):讲道在一个统一的事工计划中的角色

LESSONS 22-26:
第22-26课：
The Role of Preaching in a Unified Ministry Plan
讲道在一个统一的事工计划中的角色

The sermon should regularly be part of an overall plan of ministry in the congregation that is unified in its message and goals.  If all the components of the ministry are not joined together, members may view the church’s work as 5 or 6 separate and unrelated programs, without a clear and understandable goal.  So the sermon can and should contribute to the pastor’s goals in worship, education, evangelism, counseling, and other programs of the congregation.
讲道通常应该成为教会整个事工计划的一部分，是统一在它传达的信息和目标里。如果教会事工的所有的组成部分不能团结一致，信徒可能视教会的事工为5或6个分开的且不相关的项目，而没有一个清晰和明白的目标。所以讲道能并且应该促成牧师在敬拜，教育，传福音，咨询辅导，和其他教会规划中实现目标。
1. Worship  敬拜
Each worship service may be divided into 3 sections:  每个敬拜仪式可以分为三部分：
1. Pre-sermon   讲道前
Hymns, confession and forgiveness, readings, creed.
赞美诗，认罪和宽恕，读经，信条
2. Sermon      讲道
3. Post-sermon   讲道后
Offering, prayers, hymns, benediction.
奉献，祷告，赞美诗，祝福
It may be best to select a theme for the day, around which the service revolves.  This gives the members one main message to remember and take home with them.  The sermon theme should be closely connected to the theme of the day.  
最好为礼拜围绕的那天选择一个主题。这向信众传达了一个主要信息，记在心里并带回家。讲道的题目应该与那天的主题紧密相连。
The pre-sermon part of the service should accomplish two things: bring the people into the presence of God and focus their attention on his Word, and introduce the theme of the service with hymns and Scripture readings that tie into the theme.
礼拜的讲道前部分应该完成两件事：带领人们全神贯注于神的话语，与神同在，并通过紧扣题目的赞美诗和读经向他们介绍礼拜的主题。
The post-sermon part of the service should comprise the members’ response to the message from God’s Word.  This includes an offering of thanksgiving to God for all that he has done, prayers of thanksgiving and requests, hymns in response to the Word, and a closing benediction.  
礼拜讲道的后部分应该包含信众对神的道的信息反馈。这包括感谢神为我们所做的一切的感恩奉献，感恩祷告和请求，对应神的话的赞美诗，和一个结束祝福。
The worship services and sermons throughout the year will be guided by the church year to provide an overall view of Christ’s life and death, and our life of love and service.
贯穿一年的敬拜和讲道将由教会年历指引，提供一个对于基督的生存和死亡，和我们爱和服侍的生命的全面见解。
3. Education   教育
In planning for a year of ministry, the pastor may well want to select the main subjects for his Sunday Bible classes.  This may be a topical study (prayer, Christian parenting, etc.), or a book of the Bible.  Bible classes may also be specifically towards training members in their Christian lives--evangelism, stewardship.
 为了计划一年的教会事工，牧师也可能想为主日圣经课程选择主要科目。这可以是个专题研究（祷告，基督徒父母对子女的养育，等等），或者圣经的一卷书。圣经课程也可以争对培训信徒的基督徒生活---传福音，管家管理。
Having a plan for Bible study, the preacher can incorporate these same goals into his sermons.  There are certain objectives the pastor can accomplish in sermons, and other objectives you can accomplish in Bible class.  What are some of these?
为圣经学习作计划，传道人能够在讲道中结合这些目标。有些确定的目标牧师能在讲道中实现，另一些目标可以在圣经课上实现。这些目标是什么？
 Sermon	 Bible Class
 讲道	 圣经课                    
So if the pastor wants to teach his members more about evangelism or stewardship or prayer, he can coordinate his preaching and teaching.
如果牧师想教导信众更多关于传福音或管家管理或祷告的信息，他可以配合讲道和教导。
Examples. . .  例子......
how much teaching can you do in a sermon?   一篇讲道中你能教导多少内容？
-doctrine, applications, Bible lessons    教义，应用，圣经教训
what teaching tools to use?        采用什么教学方式？
-repetition, visual aids, illustrations   背诵，视觉教具，举例
