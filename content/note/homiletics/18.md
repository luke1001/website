第十八课(Lesson＃18):讲道和教会年历
LESSON 18:
第十八课：  
Sermons and the Church Year
讲道和教会年历
All of our Lutheran churches follow the church year as the guide for preaching.  The season or festival will be reflected in the Scripture readings, the hymns, and the sermon text and theme.  Each season or festival, of course, has a certain emphasis that revolves around the life of Christ.
所有的路德教会遵循教会年历作为讲道指南。教会节期或节日将反映在读经，赞美诗，讲道的经文和主题里。当然，每个节期或节日围绕基督的生命有一个确定的重点。
1. Advent   基督降临节
A season of preparation just before Christmas.  This is a ‘penitential’ season,  reflecting upon our sins and need for the Savior to be born.  In order to fully celebrate and appreciate the festival of Christmas, we prepare our hearts to receive the newborn King.  The liturgical color is purple or blue.
圣诞节即将到来的一个预备的节期。这是一个“忏悔”节，回顾和反思我们的罪和需要救主的降生。为了彻底庆祝和感激圣诞节的来临，我们心中做好准备来迎接新生的君王。礼拜仪式的色调是紫色或蓝色。
2. Christmas  圣诞节
The festival celebrating the birth of Jesus.  We emphasize particularly the humble setting and nature of his birth, showing us his purpose for being born.  The liturgical color is white.
庆祝耶稣降生的节日。我们特别强调他出生卑微的环境和特性，向我们表明他出生的目的。礼拜仪式的色调是白色。

3. Epiphany  主显节
The season after Christmas, which follows the ministry of Jesus on earth, focusing especially on his miracles.  “Epiphany” means “revealing, showing.”  During this season we notice how Christ demonstrated himself to be the powerful Son of God.  The liturgical color is white.
圣诞节后的节期，跟随耶稣在世的传道事工，尤其强调他所行的神迹。“  主显节”意思是“揭示，展现。”在这个节期我们注意到基督如何证明他是神的有大能的儿子。礼拜仪式的色调是白色。
4. Lent    大斋期
The season just before Easter, which looks at the suffering and death of Christ for our sins.  Lent is another ‘penitential’ season, and is the most somber in tone.  As a result, we usually would not have weddings or other festive celebrations during this season.  The liturgical color is purple.  
这个节期就在复活节前，着眼于基督为我们的罪所遭受的磨难和牺牲。大斋期是另一个“忏悔”节，并且气氛是最忧郁的。因此，我们通常在这个节日不会有婚礼或其他节日庆祝。礼拜仪式的色调是紫色。

The last week of Lent is called “Holy Week.”  The first day of Holy Week is Palm Sunday, which celebrates Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem.  This is a festive service, and the liturgical color is white.  Maundy Thursday commemorates Jesus’ institution of the Lord’s Supper in the upper room, and returns to a more somber tone.  The liturgical color returns to purple.  Good Friday, of course, remembers Jesus’ death on the cross and is the saddest, most penitential day of the church year.  The liturgical color is black or nothing.   
大斋期的最后一星期被称为“圣周。”圣周的第一天是棕枝主日，它是庆祝耶稣凯旋进入耶路撒冷。并有个庆祝的礼拜，礼拜仪式的色调是白色。濯足星期四是纪念耶稣在大楼里设立“主的晚餐”，并回到一个更忧伤的气氛中。礼拜仪式的色调是紫色。耶稣受难日，当然是纪念耶稣被钉死在十字架上，并且是教会年历中最令人伤感，最叫人忏悔的一天。礼拜仪式的色调是黑色或没有色调。
5. Easter   复活节
The most joyful festival and season of the church year, celebrating the resurrection of Christ from the dead.  The liturgical color is white.
复活节是教会年历中最喜乐的节日，庆祝基督从死里复活。礼拜仪式的色调是白色。

6. Ascension 耶稣升天节
The festival of Jesus’ returning to heaven, is also a very joyful and festive occasion.  This is a good opportunity to review the entire life of Christ on earth, and his purpose for coming.  The liturgical color is white.
耶稣回到天国的节日，也是非常喜乐和喜庆的节日。这是个好机会，回顾基督整个在世生平和他来到世上的目的。礼拜仪式的色调是白色。
7.  Pentecost  五旬节
The festival celebrates the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the birthday of the New Testament church.  The liturgical color is red.
这个节日庆祝圣灵的充满，圣灵的做工，和新约教会的诞生。礼拜仪式的色调是红色。  
The Sunday after Pentecost is sometimes celebrated as Trinity Sunday.  The Scripture readings are based upon the truth that God has revealed himself as 3 persons and 1 God.  It is a festival Sunday and the liturgical color is white.
五旬节后的星期天有时作为圣三主日来庆祝。神显示他是有三个位格的独一真神，读经基于这一真理。它是个喜庆的星期天。礼拜仪式的色调是白色。

The Sundays following are part of the “Pentecost season.”  The Scripture readings, sermon texts and themes, and hymns are more general and offer the preacher a wide variety of themes and topics to preach on.   
接下来的星期天属“五旬节节期 ”部分。读经，讲道经文及主题，和赞美诗更加普遍，并提供给传道人各种各样的题目和话题讲道。
Following the church year in our preaching is an excellent way to teach our members the entire truth of God’s Word, and follow the events of the life of Christ each year.  It is also helpful to avoid become to repetitious in our preaching, hitting on the same types of themes too often.  Many Reformed church do not preach according to the church year, except the festivals of Christmas and Easter.  The Catholic church does stay fairly close to the church year.    
我们遵循教会年历讲道是个极好的方法来教导信众关于神的道的整个真理，并且每年跟随基督的生平事迹。这还有助于避免在讲道中重复，经常碰到相同类型的题目。很多改革宗教会除了圣诞节和复活节，不按照教会年历讲道。天主教教会确实很紧守教会年历。
