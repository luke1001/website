第十三课(Lesson＃13):讲章展开
LESSON 13:
第十三课：
Developing the Sermon
讲章展开

After creating an outline for the sermon, the preacher needs to develop and expand the ideas contained in the outline. He should begin by incorporating information from his exegetical study of the sermon text into the exposition portions of the sermon. Use only that information which really fits well with the ideas of the outline. Again, it will be impossible to include everything from the exegetical study.
为讲章拟定好大纲后，传道人需要展开和延伸大纲纲领。他应首先把经文的解经查考和讲道的释经解说结合起来。仅使用真正地适合大纲纲领的信息。再次重申，讲道不可能包括解经查考的所有内容。
As you develop the sermon, remember several valuable points. 当你展开讲章时，记住以下几个要点：
Incorporate both Law and Gospel, with extra emphasis on the Gospel. 律法与福音相结合，着重强调福音。
Have the hearers been convicted of their sin by the Law? Do they appreciate the total hopelessness of trying to save themselves with their works? Do they recognize their need for a Savior? Have they heard the pure, sweet Gospel of Jesus their Savior? Do they recognize that their salvation is completely accomplished through their Savior, and heaven is theirs? Will they remember the Gospel more than the Law from your sermon?
信 众因着律法已经被定罪了吗？他们理解试图通过自己的行为拯救自己导致的彻底绝望吗？他们认识到需要救主吗？他们听说过救主耶稣这样纯粹美好的福音吗？他们 知道救恩是通过他们的救主来完全成就的吗？知道天国是他们的吗？从你的讲道中，他们记住的福音信息将比律法信息更多吗？
Balance your exposition sections and application sections. 解说部分和应用部分保持平衡。
Generally speaking, the exposition and application should be roughly equal in length. This may vary from sermon to sermon, depending upon the nature of the text. But you should not have a huge imbalance between exposition and application. If you have preached all exposition, the hearers may not know what it means for their lives. If you have preached all application, the members have not learned enough about the text.
通常来说，解经和应用篇幅长度应该大概一致。每篇讲道可能不同，根据的讲道性质而定 。但你不能在解经和应用上出现较大的不平衡。如果你整个讲道都在解经的话，信众就不知道会对他们的生活有什么意义。如果你整个讲道都在讲应用的话，信众对经文就没有学到什么。
Balance the major parts of the sermon. 平衡讲章的主要段落
If you have two or three parts in your sermon, they should be generally balanced in length. If one part is huge and another part is very small, your members may not get the point of the smaller part because it has been overshadowed by the lengthy section.
如果你的讲章有两到三个段落，段落长度一般要平衡。如果一段很长，另一段很短，信众可能无法抓住较短段落的要点，因为被长的段落削弱了重要性。
Do not try to develop too many points in one sermon. 不要在一篇讲道中试图展开多个要点。
If one of the points of your sermon seems to be inadequately developed, but the sermon is already long enough, eliminate one of the points. Better to fully develop a few points than to quickly touch upon many points.
如果讲道中的某一点似乎展开得不足，但讲章长度已够，就取消这一点。全面展开几个要点比简单触及很多要点更好。
Use illustrations, especially on highly doctrinal texts taken from the epistles. 采用举例，尤其对于取自使徒书的学说性很高的经文。
There are a variety of terms and concepts in the Bible that you will want to illustrate in order to help your members understand them well. Here is a beginning list:
圣经中有很多术语和概念，你要举例来帮助信众很好地记忆和理解。以下是个开始列表：
Sin	 罪	Forgiveness	 宽恕
Redemption	救赎	Grace	恩典
Trust	信任	Conversion	转变
Faith	信心	Sanctification	成圣
Justification	称义	Fellowship	团契
Confession	认罪	Communion	交通
Sacrament	圣礼	Conscience	良知
Inspiration	默示	Condemnation	定罪
Soul	灵魂	Atonement	赎罪日
Resurrection	耶稣复活	Ascension	耶稣升天

You will want to use pictures and examples for your members to thoroughly understand the meaning of these concepts. On occasion, you may even want to use a demonstration to show them the meaning.
你应该用图画和例子让信众彻底明白这些概念的意思。有时，你甚至用实证向他们说明意思。
