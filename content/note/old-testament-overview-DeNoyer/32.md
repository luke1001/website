Jacob’s mother, Rebekah, was from Paddan-aram (Gn 25:20). Jacob went from Beersheba to his uncle’s home in Haran (28:10). On the way, God spoke to Jacob in a dream at Bethel (28:11–22). In Haran, Jacob married Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban, Rebekah’s brother (29:1–30). Later, on his way back to Canaan, Jacob settled matters with Laban in Gilead (ch 31). He camped at Mahanaim (32:1–2), then wrestled with God at Peniel (32:22–32). Esau went to Seir, but Jacob went to Succoth and Shechem (33:16–20), then to Bethel (35:1). Rachel died near Ephrath (35:16–20). Isaac was buried at Mamre (35:27–29), and Jacob’s son Joseph rose to administer all Egypt, bringing his father and his brothers to Goshen (37:12–36; 39:1–47:12). Jacob died in Egypt and was buried at Mamre (49:28–50:14).
