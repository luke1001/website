##### Ephesians 4:1-32 以弗所书4:1-32

Ephesians 4-6 deals with practical matters concerning the Christian’s everyday life. Chapters 1-3 are what God has done for us and Chapters 4-5 are what we do in response to God’s grace.

以弗所书4-6章主要处理基督徒日常生活中的问题。第1-3章讲神为我们成就的事，第4-5章是我们回应神的恩典而应有的行为。

In verses 1-16 Paul now shows how God made provision for those in the church to live and work together in unity and to grow together into maturity.

在第1-16节中，保罗阐述神怎样供应教会中的人，使他们在生活和工作中合一并一起成熟。

###### Unity and Maturity in the Body of Christ 在基督的身体里合一并成熟

1) As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 

1 我为主被囚的劝你们，既然蒙召，行事为人就当与蒙召的恩相称。


- Of what does Paul remind his readers?

- 保罗提醒他的读者当注意什么事情？


2) Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 

2 凡事谦虚，温柔，忍耐，用爱心互相宽容，


- After whom are we to pattern our life?

- 我们的生活当谁的样式？

3) Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 

3 用和平彼此联络，竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。


- Describe the “bond of peace”. Share some examples of ways the unity of the Spirit among God’s people is disturbed.

- 解释什么是“用和平彼此联络”？分享一些神子民中间灵里合一怎样遭到破坏的例子。

4) There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 5) one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6) one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. 

4 身体只有一个，圣灵只有一个，正如你们蒙召，同有一个指望，5 一主，一信，一洗，6 一神，就是众人的父，超乎众人之上，贯乎众人之中，也住在众人之内。

- How do verses 4-6 describe the work of the Trinity – Holy Spirit, Son, and Father?

- 4-6节怎样描述了三位一体神的工作——圣灵、圣子和圣父？

7) But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 

7 我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。


- Describe the “grace” each one of us has been given. (Think back to lesson 2, verse 8.)  

- 描述神赐给我们每一个人的“恩赐（恩典）”（回想第二课，第8节。）


8) This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.” 

8 所以经上说，他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。


- This comes from Psalm 68:18 that tells us about God’s triumphant ascension to his throne in heaven. The captives are the people freed from sin. The gifts to his people are offerings He received.

- 这句话出现在诗篇68:18，说的是神的得胜和升天，并回到天上的宝座。被掳掠的人指那些他从罪中释放的人。他赐给他子民的恩赐是他收到的供物。

9) (What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions ?

9 （既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？


- In what form did Christ ascend to earth? 

- 基督以什么样式降到了地上？

10) He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) 

10 那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。）


- In what form did Christ ascend to heaven? 

- 基督以什么样式升到了天上？

11) So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,

11 他所赐的有使徒，有先知。有传福音的。有牧师和教师。


- 描述神所赐的每一个职务：

    Apostles 使徒

    Prophets 先知

    Evangelists 传福音的

    Pastors 牧师

    Teachers 教师

12) to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 

12 为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体。



- What is the primary function of these Christ-given gifts? 

- 基督所赐的这些恩赐的最基本功用是什么？

13) until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

13 直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量。


- For what purposes are God’s people to perform their works of service? 

- 神的子民为什么要有服侍的表现？

14) Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. 

14 使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计，和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。


- From what danger does spiritual maturity deliver God’s people?

- 成熟的灵命会把神的子民从哪些危险中解救出来？

15) Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. 

15 惟用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。


- What happens when we speak the truth in love? 

- 当我们用爱心说出诚实话时，会发生什么事情？

16) From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. 

16 全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用，彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。


- The parts of the body help each other in the growing process. 

- 在成长的过程中，身体的不同部位互相协助。

Paul has just discussed unity and maturity as twin goals for the church. In verses 17-32 Paul describes the new life that results from the Gospel. The law (these are the 10 Commandments which forbid sinful behavior and also urges good works) also apply because of our sinful nature.

保罗刚刚谈到，合一与成熟是教会的两个双重目标。在第17-32节中，保罗描述了福音带来的新生命。因为我们的罪性，我们还需要遵守律法（十条诫命禁止恶行，督促美善）。

###### Instructions for Christian Living 对基督徒生活的指导

17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 

17 所以我说，且在主里确实的说，你们行事，不要再像外邦人存虚妄的心行事。


- On what does God insist? What is meant by “Gentile”? 

- 神所坚持的（确实说出的）是什么？“外邦人”是什么意思？

18) They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. 19) Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. 	

18 他们心地昏昧，与神所赐的生命隔绝了，都因自己无知，心里刚硬。19 良心既然丧尽，就放纵私欲，贪行种种的污秽。



- How does Paul describe the Gentile life?

- 保罗怎样描述外邦人的生命？

20) That, however, is not the way of life you learned 21) when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. 22) You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. 

20 你们学了基督，却不是这样。21 如果你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理，22 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人。这旧人是因私欲的迷惑，渐渐变坏的。23 又要将你们的心志改换一新。24 并且穿上新人。这新人是照着神的形像造的，有真理的仁义，和圣洁。


- What is the difference between our “former way of life” and “the new self” when we were taught the truth about Jesus? 

- 我们“从前行为上的旧人”和认识耶稣真理以后的“新人”之间有哪些不同？

25) Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body. 

25 所以你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话。因为我们是互相为肢体。


- What reason does Paul offer for telling the truth? 

- 保罗说我们要说实话的原因是什么？

26) “In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, 

26 生气却不要犯罪。不可含怒到日落。


- Who is not to go to bed while still angry? Does this mean the issues should be resolved at that time? Explain why you said yes or no.

- 谁在生气的时候不应该去睡觉（等到日落）？这是不是说应该在那个时候把问题解决掉？解释你为什么说是，或者不是？

27) and do not give the devil a foothold. 

27 也不可给魔鬼留地步。


- Who is waiting when we sin? 

- 当我们犯罪的时候，谁在等候我们？

28) Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need. 29) Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. 30) And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31) Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 32) Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. 

28 从前偷窃的，不要再偷。总要劳力，亲手作正经事，就可有余分给那缺少的人。29 污秽的言语，一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。30 不要叫神的圣灵担忧。你们原是受了他的印记，等候得赎的日子来到。31 一切苦毒，恼恨，忿怒，嚷闹，毁谤，并一切的恶毒，（或作阴毒）都当从你们中间除掉。32 并要以恩慈相待，存怜悯的心，彼此饶恕，正如神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。


- Are there instances of people today who have done evil for so long that they have become blind to their wrong doing?

- 当人在罪里待的时间过长时，就对自己的罪变得麻木。今天是否存在这样的情形？

Look at verses 28-32. What is the sinful act and how can we change it?

查看第28-32节。哪些是罪恶的行为？我们应该怎样改过？ 

|        |   Sinful act罪性  |    The way to change改过的方式   |
|   ----   |    ----   |   ----  |
|   vs.28 第28节   |        |         |
|   vs.29 第29节   |        |         |
|   vs.30-31 第30-31节   |         |       |
|   vs.32 第32节   |           |           |


Don’t hold on to anger. God warns us against rehearsing our angry thoughts in a way that builds angers. Why do you think that God’s people so often ignore His warning and harbor grudges?

不可以一直生气！神警告我们，不可以一直抱着生气的想法而让怒气日益加增。

你认为神的子民为什么常常忽略他的警告而怀恨在心呢？

In vs. 32, what is the reason for changing?

在第32节中，应当改变的原因是什么？
