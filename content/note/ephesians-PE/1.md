##### Ephesians 2:1-21 以弗所书2:1-21

在第1-10中，犹太派基督徒威胁早期大多数基督徒群体，说，归主的外邦人除了相信基督之外，还必须要遵守旧约的律法。

在第11-22节中，保罗谈到了救赎方面的内容，里面提到神使从前互相敌对的犹太人与外邦人和好了。

11 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called “uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body by human hands)— 


11 所以你们应当记念，你们从前按肉体是外邦人，是称为没受割礼的，这名原是那些凭人手在肉身上称为受割礼之人所起的。


- Who are the uncircumcised and who are the circumcised? Which was the chosen race – the race that the Savior would come from? 

- 谁是未受割礼的人？谁是受割礼的人？哪一个是被拣选的民族——即基督将从其中出来的民族？



12) remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.

- What difference is the new relationship between Jew and Gentile because of Christ? 

- 犹太人与外邦人之间因着基督的缘故建立了一种新的关系，这种关系与以前的关系有什么不同？


15) by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,

- 我们都进到谁的面前？在第14-18节中，“和平”一次出现过几次？保罗所说的和平是什么？

19) Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household,
