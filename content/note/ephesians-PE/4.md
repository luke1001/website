##### Ephesians 5:1-32 以弗所书5：1-32

Paul continues to give instructions for Christian living in verses 1-20.

保罗继续对基督徒作生活方面的教导 （1-20）

1) Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children 

1 所以你们该效法神，好像蒙慈爱的儿女一样。

- How can we imitate God? (Think back to chapter 4:25-32.) 

- 我们可以怎样效法神？（回想4:25-32）

2) and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. 

2 也要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物，和祭物，献与神。


- How was Christ like a “fragrant offering”?

- 督怎样作了“馨香的供物”？

3) But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. 

3 至于淫乱，并一切污秽，或是贪婪，在你们中间连提都不可，方合圣徒的体统。


- How high are the standards of conduct to which God calls His people?

- 神呼召他的子民在世遵循的行为准则有多高？
 
4) Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. 

4 淫词，妄语，和戏笑的话，都不相宜，总要说感谢的话。


- What do you think is meant by “coarse joking”? 

- 你认为“戏笑”的话是什么意思？

5) For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 

5 因为你们确实的知道，无论是淫乱的，是污秽的，是有贪心的，在基督和神的国里，都是无分的。有贪心的，就与拜偶像的一样。


- What apparently had been happening to prompt Paul to write such a strong warning against sinful desires and conduct? 

- 当时发生了哪些明显的事情促使保罗写出这样强烈的言辞，警告人们不可有罪恶的意念和行为？

6) Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 

6 不要被人虚浮的话欺哄。因这些事，神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。


- What do we call “empty words”? What will happen to these people?

- 我们把“虚浮的话”叫什么？这些人身上会发生什么事情？

7) Therefore do not be partners with them. 

7 所以你们不要与他们同伙。

- What kind of partnership should we have?

- 我们应该结交怎样的伙伴？

 8) For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 

8 从前你们是暗昧的，但如今在主里面是光明的，行事为人就当像光明的子女。

- What would it be like to live in darkness and to live in light?

- 住在黑暗中和住在光明中是什么样子？

9) (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 

9 光明所结的果子，就是一切良善，公义，诚实。


- What kind of fruit does the light give? 

- 明结出的是哪种果子？

10) and find out what pleases the Lord. 11) Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. 

10 总要察验何为主所喜悦的事。11 那暗昧无益的事，不要与人同行，倒要责备行这事的人


- How can we expose the deeds of darkness?

- 我们怎样揭露/责备暗昧的行为？

12) It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 13) But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 14) This is why it is said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” 

12 因为他们暗中所行的，就是提起来，也是可耻的。13 凡事受了责备，就被光显明出来。因为一切能显明的，就是光。14 所以主说，你这睡着的人，当醒过来，从死里复活，基督就要光照你了。


- How were we dead? How can we be alive?

- 我们是怎样死的？又怎样能活过来？

15) Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16) making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 17) Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. Think back to chapter 1 – 

15 你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。16 要爱惜光阴，因为现今的世代邪恶。17 不要作糊涂人，要明白主的旨意如何。

- What is the Lord’s will? How can we be foolish? 

- 回想第一章——神的旨意是什么？我们是怎样愚昧的？

18) Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 

18 不要醉酒，酒能使人放荡，乃要被圣灵充满。

- True or false: Once we are filled with the spirit, we do not need to be filled again.

- 判断正误：我们只要一旦被圣灵充满，就再不需要被充满了。

19) speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 

19 当用诗章，颂词，灵歌，彼此对说，口唱心和的赞美主。

- What is Paul stressing is the proper use of our tongue?

- 保罗强调，我们的舌头要怎样使用才合适？

20) always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

20 凡事要奉我们主耶稣基督的名，常常感谢父神。

In verses 22-23, Paul will discuss another important area: living a life that joyfully accepts the role and responsibilities that He gives to husbands and wives.

在第22-23节中，保罗将谈到另一个重要方面：丈夫和妻子要欢喜地接受自己的角色和责任。

###### Instructions for Christian Households 对基督徒家庭的教导


21) Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 

21 又当存敬畏基督的心，彼此顺服。

- How do a husband and wife submit to each other?

- 丈夫和妻子怎样彼此顺服？

22) Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 

22 你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。

- How does the wife view her husband? 

- 妻子当怎样看她的丈夫？

23) For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24) Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 


23 因为丈夫是妻子的头，如同基督是教会的头。他又是教会全体的救主。24 教会怎样顺服基督，妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。

- Read “head” in the notes. Explain why a wife should submit to her husband.

- 读注释中对“头”的解释。说明妻子为什么要顺服她的丈夫？

25) Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 

25 你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。

- How did Christ show His love for His church (believers)? 

- 基督怎样表示他对教会（信徒）的爱？

26) to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 

26 要用水借着道，把教会洗净，成为圣洁，

- What are some ways Christ made His church (believers) holy?

- 基督用了哪些方法（列举几个）使他的教会（信徒）成为圣洁？

27) and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 

27 可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。

- How are we “holy and blameless”? 

- 我们是怎样“圣洁没有瑕疵”的？
 
28) In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 

28 丈夫也当照样爱妻子，如同爱自己的身子。爱妻子，便是爱自己了。


- Explain how a husband, who loves his wife, loves himself?  Agree or disagree: The wife’s position of submission to her husband in marriage indicates that she is inferior to him. Agree or disagree: The husband has a greater responsibility than the wife in their marriage relationship.

- 解释：为什么说丈夫爱妻子，就是爱自己了？

    是否同意：妻子在婚姻中对丈夫的顺服表明她的地位比他低。

    是否同意：丈夫在婚姻关系中承担的责任比妻子更大。

29) After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 

29 从来没有人恨恶自己的身子，总是保养顾惜，正像基督待教会一样。

- How does Christ take care of the church?  

- 基督怎样照顾他的教会？
 
30) for we are members of his body. 31_ “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” 32) This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33) However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.  

30 因我们是他身上的肢体。（有古卷在此有就是他的骨他的肉）。31 为这个缘故，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，二人成为一体。32 这是极大的奥秘，但我是指着基督和教会说的。33 然而你们各人都当爱妻子，如同爱自己一样。妻子也当敬重她的丈夫。


- Paul summarizes that everyone should love and value the spouse God has given them.

- 保罗总结说，每个人都要珍惜并爱护神赐给他们的配偶。

###### Notes: 注释:

**Fragrant offering** – In the Old Testament the offering of a sacrifice pleased the Lord so much that is was described as a “pleasing aroma”. For example Exodus 29:18Then burn the entire ram on the altar.  It is a burnt offering to the Lord, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the Lord by fire.

**馨香的供物**：在旧约中，献祭中的供物被神所喜悦，所以被形容为一种“馨香之气”。例如，出29:18 要把全羊烧在坛上，是给耶和华献的燔祭，是献给耶和华为馨香的火祭。

**Debauchery** – Reckless behavior, unrestrained by good sense.

**放荡**—不计后果、不受理智约束的行为，如纵情酒色等。

**Submit** – The Greek verb means to rank people or things in order. It does not 
imply inferiority or lesser value. Think of team sports. The players have different positions and each position is needed for the team’s success. Each player can’t do his own thing if the team is to win.

**顺服**—希腊动词的意思是把人或物品按照顺序排列。不包含低一级或价值更低的意思。想想小组运动中，队员的位置不同，但每个位置都是成功的要素； 要想全队获胜，每个队员就必须要守好自己的位置。

**Head** - "Head" does not mean male dominance, where a man lords it over a woman and demands her total obedience. God never viewed women as second-class citizens. His Word clearly states that we are all equally His children and are of equal value and worth before Him. As Galatians 3:28 tells us, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" God has placed the husband in the position of responsibility. The Apostle Paul says that the husband is head of the wife as Christ is head of the church. He is her head as being vitally interested in her welfare. He is her protector. His pattern is Christ Who, as head of the Church, is its Savior!

**头**—“头”的意思不是指男性统治：男人凌驾于女人之上，要求她完全顺服。神从来没有把女人看成二等公民。他的话清楚地指出，我们都平等地作他的孩子，在他面前有着相等的价值。如加拉太书3:28所说：“并 不 分 犹 太 人 、 希 腊 人 、 自 主 的 、 为 奴 的 ， 或 男 或 女 ， 因 为 你 们 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 都 成 为 一 了 。”神把丈夫放在一个承担责任的位置。使徒保罗说，丈夫是妻子的头，正如基督是教会的头。他是她的头，要完全为她的好处着想；他是她的保护者。他的模板就是基督，基督是教会的头，也是它的救主！

**Love your wives** – A husband’s unconditional acceptance of his wife is not based upon her performance, but on her worth as God's gift to him. A husband should let her know verbally that he values her, respects her, and loves her.

**爱你的妻子**—丈夫对妻子无条件的接纳。这种接纳不是基于她的表现，而是因为她的价值，因为她是神赐给他的礼物。丈夫应该用言语向她表达他对她的看重，尊敬她，爱她。

**Holy and blameless** – As Christ is holy and blameless, we are made blameless by Christ’s forgiveness.

**圣洁无瑕疵**—正如基督是圣洁无瑕疵的，我们也因着基督的饶恕而成为圣洁，没有瑕疵。

**The two will become one flesh** – This is the description of marriage. God designed marriage to be a Gospel picture of Christ and the church.

**二人成为一体**— 这是对婚姻的描述。神设计了婚姻，让它成为一幅基督与教会之间的福音图画。

**Profound mystery** – The union of Christ and the church (believers) is beyond unaided human understanding.
**奥秘**—基督与教会（信徒）的联合超过了人所能理解的范畴。
