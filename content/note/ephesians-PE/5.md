##### Ephesians 6:1-24 以弗所书6:1-24

###### The Relationship between Children and Parents 孩子与父母的关系

1) Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2) “Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise— 3) “so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.” 

1 你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。2 要孝敬父母，使你得福，在世长寿。3 这是第一条带应许的诫命。

6:14 所以要站稳了，用真理当作带子束腰，用公义当作护心镜遮胸。6:15 又用平安的福音，当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上，6:16 此外又拿着信德当作藤牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。6:17 并戴上救恩的头盔，拿着圣灵的宝剑，就是神的道。

- For what does Paul finally pray? 

- 保罗最后为什么事情祷告？


Every Christian prays. But we can so easily get our priorities mixed up in our prayer life. Most often we pray in times of personal need, for safety of loved ones, and for healing from a sickness. These are important things to pray for, but we must also pray for the welfare of our soul, for the fight against Satan and that Christ will keep our life on course with Him.

每一个基督徒都祈祷，但我们在祷告中却很容易把优先次序弄颠倒。我们常常为个人的需要、亲人的安全以及疾病得医治祷告。这些的确是重要的事情，需要祷告，但我们也必须要为我们灵魂的需要来祷告，为与撒旦的争战祷告，并祈求基督保守我们的生命合乎圣徒的体统。

###### Notes 注释

**Obey** – Comes from two Greek words that mean “to hear under”. This 	emphasizes “listening”.

**顺服**—来自两个希腊语的单词，意为“在---之下听”，强调“正在听”。

**Do not exasperate your children** – Roman fathers had absolute power over their children. Fathers here are told they must not act unreasonable or with anger toward their children. Parenting begins with parents remembering that they are ruled by God’s love in Christ. Children still need clear rules and consistent discipline so that they can say “I’m sorry” while the father says “I forgive you”.

**不要惹儿女的气**—罗马的父亲对他们的孩子有绝对的权利。父亲们在这里被告知，他们一定不能无理地对待孩子或对孩子生气。在父母管教孩子以前，他们首先要记住：他们是被神在基督里的爱所管制的。孩子们仍然需要清楚的规则和一致的规范。这样，孩子在违背规则时就要说：“对不起！”，而父亲也要说“我原谅你！”

**Fear** - The fear of the Lord is an attitude of respect, a response of reverence and wonder. It helps us grow to become more like God—to grow in love.

**敬畏**—对神的敬畏是一种尊敬的态度，一种崇敬和惊愕的回应，帮助我们变得越来越像神，并能在爱里成长。
