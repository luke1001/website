##### Ephesians 1:1-23 以弗所书1:1-23

The key problem Paul addresses is division between the congregation’s Jewish and Gentile members.

保罗谈论教会里犹太人与外邦信徒之间的分歧问题。

1) Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God’s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: 2) Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

1 奉神旨意，作基督耶稣使徒的保罗，写信给在以弗所的圣徒，就是在基督耶稣里有忠心的人。2 愿恩惠平安，从神我们的父，和主耶稣基督，归与你们。


Look at Acts 26:11-17 

查看使徒行传26:11-17


11) Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that I even hunted them down in foreign cities. 12) “On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 13) About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions. 14) We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’ 15) “Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ the Lord replied. 16) ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me. 17) I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them.

11 在各会堂，我屡次用刑，强逼他们说亵渎的话。又分外恼恨他们，甚至追逼他们直到外邦的城邑。12 那时，我领了祭司长的权柄和命令，往大马色去。13 王阿，我在路上，晌午的时候，看见从天发光，比日头还亮，四面照着我，并与我同行的人。14 我们都仆倒在地，我就听见有声音，用希伯来话，向我说，扫罗，扫罗，为什么逼迫我。你用脚踢刺是难的。15 我说，主阿，你是谁。主说，我就是你所逼迫的耶稣。16 你起来站着，我特意向你显现，要派你作执事作见证，将你所看见的事，和我将要指示你的事，证明出来。17 我也要救你脱离百姓和外邦人的手。
