##### Ephesians 3:1-21 以弗所书3:1-21

Paul continues the doctrinal section, found in chapters 1-3.

保罗继续教导教义（第1-3章）

Verses 1-13  Here are some of the basic truths relating to the Church, the body of Christ. Those who place their faith in Christ are members of this body. Each member (us) should have a vital interest in what it means to belong to Christ’s body (His church-not a building).

第1-13节讲述有关基督身体——教会的一些基本真理。那些相信基督的人就是这个身体的组成部分。每个部分（我们）都要特别关心属于基督身体（他的教会，不是建筑物）的含义。

###### God’s Marvelous Plan for the Gentiles 神对外邦人的美好计划

1) For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— 

1 因此，我保罗为你们外邦人作了基督耶稣被囚的，替你们祈祷（此句乃照对十四节所加）



- Go back to the Introduction to read how and why Paul became an apostle to the Gentiles. When Paul wrote this letter, where was he in Rome？

- 再读介绍部分的内容，找出保罗是怎样以及为什么成了一个向外邦人传福音的使徒。当保罗写这封信时，他在罗马的什么地方？

2) Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 

2 谅必你们曾听见神赐恩给我，将关切你们的职分托付我，


- Look at Galatians 1:12, 12)I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. How did Paul learn about Jesus? 

- 参考加拉太书1:12因 为 我 不 是 从 人 领 受 的 ， 也 不 是 人 教 导 我 的 ， 乃 是 从 耶 稣 基 督 启 示 来 的 。保罗是怎样认识耶稣的？

3) that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 

3 用启示使我知道福音的奥秘，正如我以前略略写过的。


- What are some of the mysteries we can only learn from the Bible? 

- 我们只能从圣经中了解到的奥秘有哪些？

4) In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 

4 你们念了，就能晓得我深知基督的奥秘。


- How will the Ephesians understand the mystery of Christ?  

- 以弗所的人怎样才能明白基督的奥秘？

5) which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. 

5 这奥秘在以前的世代，没有叫人知道，像如今借着圣灵启示他的圣使徒和先知一样。


- What was not made known to earlier Jews in regards to Gentiles? 

- 我们现在知道了有关外邦人的哪三件事？


6) This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

6 这奥秘就是外邦人在基督耶稣里，借着福音，得以同为后嗣，同为一体，同蒙应许。



- What three things do we now know about the Gentiles?

- 我们现在知道了有关外邦人的哪三件事？

7) I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power. 8) Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, 


7 我作了这福音的执事，是照神的恩赐。这恩赐是照他运行的大能赐给我的。8 我本来比众圣徒中最小的还小。然而他还赐我这恩典，叫我把基督那测不透的丰富，传给外邦人。



- How did Paul feel about his role as a minister to the Gentiles? 

- 保罗对自己作为外邦人使者的角色感觉怎样？


9) and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 

9 又使众人都明白，这历代以来隐藏在创造万物之神里的奥秘，是如何安排的。


- To whom was Paul going to reveal this mystery?

- 保罗要把这一奥秘向谁揭示出来？ 


10) His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

10 为要借着教会使天上执政的，掌权的，现在得知神百般的智慧。


- What was God’s intent in revealing this mystery?

- 神将这个奥秘揭示出来的意图是什么？

11)  according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

11 这是照神从万世以前，在我们主基督耶稣里所定的旨意。


- What is the “eternal purpose”? Why do you think Paul keeps repeating the message that the Jews and Gentiles are both heirs to heaven? 

- 那个“永恒的旨意”是什么？你认为保罗为什么一直在重复犹太人与外邦人同是天国后嗣的信息？


12) In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. 

12 我们因信耶稣，就在他里面放胆无惧，笃信不疑的来到神面前。


- What makes it possible for us to approach God? 

- 我们能够来到神面前的原因是什么？

13) I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. 

13 所以我求你们，不要因我为你们所受的患难丧胆。这原是你们的荣耀。


- How would Paul’s sufferings serve the glory of the Ephesians and give them no cause for discouragement? 

- 保罗遭遇的痛苦怎样成就了以弗所教会的荣耀，使他们没有理由丧胆

- Which is correct: God has told us all we want to know – or - God has told us all we need to know.

- 哪个正确：神已经将我们想知道的一切都告诉了我们-还是-神已经将我们需要知道的一切都告诉了我们。


In verses 14-21, Paul breaks out in prayer and praise.

###### A Prayer for the Ephesians 为以弗所人祷告

14 因此，我在父面前屈膝，


- The normal posture for prayer in the early church was standing. Why would Paul kneel?

- 早期教会通常祷告的姿势是站着。为什么保罗要跪着呢？

15) from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. 

15 （天上地上的各（或作全）家，都是从他得名）


- From whom does every family derive its name?
