### A STUDY OF ROMANS 1-8  《罗马书》1-8章的学习

#### altRIGHTEOUS BY FAITH THROUGH THE GOSPEL 因着福音因信称义

“This letter is truly the most important piece in the New Testament. It is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian's while not only to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as though it were the daily bread of the soul. It is impossible to read or to meditate on this letter too much or too well. The more one deals with it, the more precious it becomes and the better it tastes.” (Martin Luther, Introduction to the Book of Romans)

“这封书信是新约书卷中最重要的一卷，这是纯粹的福音，值得基督徒不仅逐字逐句记住而且值得他们当作每日灵粮每天研读，无论读多少或灵修多少都不为过。研读越多，它变得越珍贵，品尝起来味道越好。”（马丁.路德，《罗马书介绍》）

Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is writing to people, most of whom he has never met, whom he hopes to meet in the future. It is truly a missionary letter, preparing his readers to assist Paul in spreading the gospel still further in the world. It is the very heart of the Christian message, justification by grace through faith. While it nails our sinful self to the wall, leaving us no room for boasting before God or men, it also nails Christ to the cross. He becomes our reason to boast before God since God, through Jesus, by faith, has justified us freely.

受圣灵所感，保罗给罗马人写了信，其中多数是他从没见过但希望将来见到的人。这真正是一封传福音的书信，使他的读者准备好帮助他进一步在世上传福音。这个福音就是凭借恩典因信称义，是基督教信息的最核心。这个福音一方面把我们的罪性的自我钉到墙上，使我们在上帝和人面前都没有夸口的余地，另一方面也把耶稣钉上了十字架。他成为我们在上帝面前夸口的理由，因为上帝因着耶稣因着我们的信使我们白白称义。

Romans 1:17 For in the righteousness of God is made evident, by faith in faith as it remains written, "the righteous by faith will live.

罗1：17 因为　神的义、正在显明出来。这义是本于信、于信。如经上所记、“义人必因信得生。”

罗1：19 神的事情、人所能知道的、原显明在人心里。因为　神已经给他们显明。

Romans 1:20 From the creation of the world, his invisible qualities, his endless power and divine nature are visible, made understandable by what has been made, so that they( humans )are without excuse

罗1：20 自从造天地以来、　神的永能和神性是明明可知的、虽是眼不能见、但借着所造之物、就可以晓得、叫人无可推诿。

Romans 1:21 For though they had knowledge of God, as God they did not glorify him or thank him rather their thinking became worthless and their foolish hearts darkened

罗1：21 因为他们虽然知道　神、却不当作　神荣耀他、也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄、无知的心就昏暗了。

Romans 1:22 Although they claim to be wise, they became foolish.

罗1：22 聪明、反成了愚拙、

Romans 1:23 And they exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for images made like perishable man and birds and animals and reptiles.

罗1：23 将不能朽坏之　神的荣耀、变为偶像、彷彿必朽坏的人、和飞禽走兽昆虫的样式

Romans 1:24 Therefore God handed them over, in connection with the lusts of their hearts, to sexual impurity for the disgracing of their bodies with each other.

罗1：24 所以　神任凭他们、逞着心里的情欲行污秽的事、以致彼此玷辱自己的身体。

Romans 1:25 They exchanged the Truth of God for falsehood and worshipped and served created things rather than the creator who is well spoken of forever. Amen

罗1：25 他们将　神的真实变为虚谎、去敬拜事奉受造之物、不敬奉那造物的主。主乃是可称颂的、直到永远。阿们。

Romans 1:26 Because of this, God handed them over to dishonorable desires. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones

罗1：26 因此　神任凭他们放纵可羞耻的情欲。他们的女人、把顺性的用处、变为逆性的用处。

Romans 1:27 Likewise men abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with desire for each other. Men with men doing shameful deeds and receiving in themselves the appropriate penalty for their sinful wandering.

罗1：27男人也是如此、弃了女人顺性的用处、欲火攻心、彼此贪恋、男和男行可羞耻的事、就在自己身上受这妄为当得的报应。

Romans 1:28 And also, since they did not judge the knowledge of God worthwhile, God abandoned them to a senseless mind, to do what should not be done

罗1：28他们既然故意不认识　神、　神就任凭他们存邪僻的心、行那些不合理的事。

Romans 1:29 They continue to be filled with every kind of unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, baseness, full of envy, murder, discord, deceit, malice and gossip

罗1：29 装满了各样不义、邪恶、贪婪、恶毒。（或作阴毒）满心是嫉妒、凶杀、争竞、诡诈、毒恨。

Romans 1:30 Slanderers, hating God, violent, arrogant, braggarts, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents

罗1：30 又是谗毁的、背后说人的、怨恨　神的、（或作被　神所憎恶的）侮慢人的、狂傲的、自夸的、捏造恶事的、违背父母的、

Romans 1:31 senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.

罗1：31 无知的、背约的、无亲情的、不怜悯人的。

Romans 1:32 Although they know the righteous verdict of God that those doing such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do them but also support those who do.

罗1：32 他们虽知道　神判定、行这样事的人是当死的、然而他们不但自己去行、还喜欢别人去行。

##### B. NOTES 笔记

Verse 1   Paul’s position in life as an apostle was not self-chosen. How could he choose for himself, he was a slave, completely subservient to his master? However Paul's benevolent master was Christ Jesus, God's anointed Savior of the world. His master assigned Paul to be God's representative, designating him for proclaiming God's great, good news, the gospel.

第1节 保罗作为使徒的职分不是自选的。他是个仆人，完全服从他的主人，他怎么能自己选择呢？不过，保罗仁慈的主人是耶稣基督，上帝受膏的世界救主。主人分配保罗作上帝的代表，指派他宣扬上帝的福音，伟大的好消息。

Verses 2-5   Who is Jesus? The question has two answers depending on which of Christ's two natures you are speaking about. If it's his human nature, then, he's a descendent of David, completely, in keeping with his full human nature. Jesus was just like we are physically except for one difference, an important one, absolute sinlessness.

2-5节 耶稣是谁？这个问题有两个答案，就看你是讨论的耶稣的两个性质中的哪一个。如果是他的人性，那么，他是大卫的子孙，这和他全然的人性是完全一致的。除了一个差异，一个重要的差异，耶稣和我们在肉体上一样，这个差异就是，他的全然无罪。

When you look at Jesus Christ another way, considering his absolute purity, the reason death could not hold him for long, you also are led to conclude. This one is none other than Jesus Christ, God's holy Son, our Lord.

当你从另一方面看耶稣基督，看他的绝对的神性，也就是死亡不能长久控制他的原因，你也会得出结论：这位不是别人，正是耶稣基督，上帝的圣子，我们的主。

Verses 6-7   Here, with his greeting, Paul focuses on a select group of believers, those in Rome. Like believers everywhere, in a purposeful way God loves them, with his call declaring them to be his saints. The summary of their new standing before God is they enjoy the grace, the undeserved love and the peace that comes with it through their relationship with God their Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

6-7节 通过他的问安，保罗着眼于一群特选的信徒，那些生活在罗马的信徒。正如对其他地方的信徒一样，上帝有目的的爱他们，上帝用他的呼召宣告他们是他的圣徒。他们在上帝面前的新身份可以总结为一点：他们享有恩典，他们不配得到的爱以及由于他们和上帝父和主耶稣的关系而产生的平安。

Verses 8-10   Paul, persistently, never stopped praying. Always keeping in mind God's will, Paul asks God, at long last, after so many times requesting it, that a way to visit these Roman Christian would be found for him.

8-10节 保罗始终坚持不懈地祷告。他一直记着上帝的愿望，经过长期的恳求，最终向上帝要求为他开一条拜访罗马基督徒的道路。

Verses 11-13   It came sincerely from deep within him, Paul desires to pass along to them some spiritual gift, some gracious activity of God that from deep within them they might be fortified in their Christian faith. Just as the giver of every spiritual gift, God, is always giving, we, just like him, want to be on the giving side, imparting spiritual gifts to others.

11-13节 保罗的愿望发自肺腑，他想要给他们传递一个属灵的恩赐，能使他们在内心深处在基督教信仰方面得以坚固的上帝的恩典的活动。作为每一个属灵恩赐的给予者，上帝总是在给予，我们如同他一样，也想在给予这一方，向别人传递出属灵的恩赐。

Verses 14-15   Paul has a God-given obligation to everyone: the cultured and the uncultured, the educated and the unschooled. Again, God's grace will clearly be seen to be undeserved, no quality in us, no social standing, and no academic attainment qualifies us for God's favor. Our obligation to everyone is the same, the proclamation of the gospel.

14-15节 保罗对大家有着上帝赋予的责任：教化的和化外的，受教育的和未受教育的。同样，上帝的恩典清楚地显明我们是不配的，我们任何的品质，社会地位，学术成就都不能使我们有资格受到上帝的恩待。我们对每个人的责任都是一样的，即宣讲福音。

Verses 16-17   We need to make no apologies for the strength of the gospel. It's dynamic; God's power is behind it, resulting in salvation, first of all, in point of time, for the Jews but also, in time, for Gentiles. God does not prefer one over the other. He uses the same power, the power innate in the gospel to bring believers of every ethnic group to saving faith.

16-17节 对于福音的力量，我们没有需要道歉的。福音是动态的，上帝的大能居于其后，导致对人的拯救，在时间上先救犹太人，但最终也救外邦人。上帝并没有偏待任何人，他用同样的大能，这大能是内在于福音里的，最终把每个民族的信徒带向拯救的信念。


The gospel reveals the Father's love. It had to be revealed, humans would never have guessed it. God's righteousness was to be received by faith for faith is the hand God creates to receive the gift God gives. Through faith God declares us to be righteous.

福音显示了父的爱，人永远无法猜出这福音，它必须予以显现。上帝的义要通过信才能被接受，因为信是上帝创造的手，是来接受上帝的恩赐的。上帝宣告我们因信称义。

Verses 18-20   God has not let himself without witnesses, part of that witness being right inside of human beings. The natural knowledge of God plainly, in an unspoken way, reveals God's will for the way humans are to be and act.

18-20节 上帝没有让他自己没有见证，这个见证一部分在人心。不用言语，上帝的自然律明白的显示出上帝对人的行事为人的意愿。

God has ways and means of making his invisible qualities visible without speaking a word. It is the only logical conclusion to which creatures can come when they observe the wonders of the created world. There simply had to be a creator, one who possesses endless power and who reveals, in his creation, his superiority; he's divine.

不用言语上帝有方法将他不可见的特性显现出来，当人观察创造的世界的神奇时，这是他们能得出的唯一的符合逻辑的结论。必须曾经有一位创造者，拥有无穷大能并在创造中显出他的超凡；他是神圣的。

![](/images/note/romans/1-3.jpg#right)

Verses 21-23   What happens when we ignore the laws of nature, ignoring what obviously is true? Here is the result when humans ignore their natural knowledge of God. They do not give God the glory for everything nor, failing that, do they thank him for anything. Ignoring this basic premise, their self-drawn conclusions could only be foolish, their foolish hearts darkened, lacking true understanding about anything and everything

21-23节 当我们忽视自然律时，忽视明显为真的时候，会发生什么呢？这是人类忽视他们对上帝的天然了解的结果。他们既不把一切归于 神的荣耀也不为任何事向 神感谢。忽视了这一根本前提，他们自己得出的结论只能是愚蠢的，他们愚蠢的心变得昏暗，缺少对任何事的真正的理解。

Verses 24-25   Because of their self-chosen foolishness, discounting the wisdom God had given them, exalting the perishable over the imperishable, God let them go. He allowed them to pursue their sinful lusts thereby disgracing themselves with one another. Turning creation upside down, in ways God never intended, they have perverted what God intended. In judgment God lets them go on in their shameful ways.

24-25节 由于他们自己选择的愚蠢，轻看上帝给他们的智慧，把必朽坏的置于不能朽坏的之上，上帝任凭他们行事。他让他们追逐自己肉身的欲望，因而彼此羞辱自己。他们违背上帝的意图，用上帝没有打算的方法颠倒创造。作为惩罚，上帝让他们继续他们可耻的事。

Verses 26-27    The downward spiral continues as they reject as worthless a proper knowledge of God. God releases all restraint, giving them a senseless mind and acting on it they do what is not appropriate, what is contrary to the right knowledge of God but consistent with their own senseless mind

26-27节 当他们拒绝对上帝的正确的理解时，下滑的螺旋会继续。上帝释放一切约束，给他们一个没有感觉的心灵，按照这个心灵的旨意行事，他们做不恰当的事，这些事和他们自己的麻木的心灵相符但和对上帝的正确认识相左。

Verses 28-32   "Out of the heart", the perverted mind, Jesus said, springs all manner of wickedness. Here is another list, all the evil things which result when the knowledge of God is rejected and when humans follow the way of the fallen world. Every unrighteous thing human devise is ungodly and selfish, doing what pleases self alone and is detrimental to everyone else.

28-32 耶稣说，一切的邪恶都出自“心“，堕落的心灵。这里又是另一列表，当对上帝的认识被摈弃，当人遵从这个堕落世界的方式时，会出现所有的恶事。人做着害人悦己的事，他们所设计的每一件不义的事都是不敬神的，都是自私的。

Those who act this way know the righteous verdict of God. They know they are worthy of death. But still, without interruption, they continue in their chosen downward, wayward path. And, they offer support and encouragement to those who practice all forms of evil with them.

这样行事的人知道上帝正义的裁决，他们知道他们只配死，可是他们仍然继续他们选择的下滑，而且他们支持并鼓励对那些和他们一起行各样恶事的人。
