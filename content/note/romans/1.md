##### A. TRANSLATION ROMANS 2:1-29 翻译《罗马书》2:1-29

Romans 2:1 Therefore you are inexcusable, o man, for in whatever way you judge the other you are judging yourself because you, the judge, are doing the same things

罗 2:1你这论断人的、无论你是谁、也无可推诿、你在什么事上论断人、就在什么事上定自己的罪。因你这论断人的、自己所行却和别人一样。

Romans 2:2 We always know God's verdict is according to truth against those who do such things.

罗 2:2 我们知道这样行的人,   神必照真理审判他。

Romans 2:3 Are you thinking this, O mortal, as you pass judgment on others while doing the same things, you will run away from God’s judgment?

罗 2:3你这人哪、你论断行这样事的人、自己所行的却和别人一样、你以为能逃脱　神的审判么。

Romans 2:4 Or do you despise the richness of his kindness, tolerance and patience unmindful that God's loving-kindness leads you to repentance?

罗 2:4还是你藐视他丰富的恩慈、宽容、忍耐、不晓得他的恩慈是领你悔改呢。

Romans 2:5 Because of your stubborn and unresponsive heart you are reserving for yourself wrath in the day of God’s wrath, when his righteousness is uncovered.

罗 2:5 你竟任着你刚硬不悔改的心、为自己积蓄忿怒、以致　神震怒、显他公义审判的日子来到。

Romans 2:6 God will give to each according to his work.

罗 2:6 他必照各人的行为报应各人。

Romans 2:7  To those, holding steady in doing good, desire glory, honor and deathlessness, eternal life.

罗 2:7凡恒心行善、寻求荣耀尊贵、和不能朽坏之福的、就以永生报应他们。

Romans 2:8 But to those out of self-interest rejecting the truth and following unrighteousness wrath and anger.

罗 2:8惟有结党不顺从真理、反顺从不义的、就以忿怒恼恨报应他们。

Romans 2:9 Pressure and pain for every human soul who pursues evil for the Jew first also for the Gentile.

罗 2:9 将患难、困苦、加给一切作恶的人、先是犹太人、后是希腊人。

Romans 2:10 But glory and honor and peace for the everyone doing good, the Jew to start with and then the Gentile.

罗 2:10却将荣耀、尊贵、平安、加给一切行善的人、先是犹太人、后是希腊人。

Romans 2:11 For there is no favoritism with God.

罗 2:11因为　神不偏待人。

Romans 2:12 All who sinned without the law, without the law will perish. And those, in connection with the law sinned, by the law will be judged,

罗 2:12凡没有律法犯了罪的、也必不按律法灭亡。凡在律法以下犯了罪的、也必按律法受审判、

Romans 2:13 For not those who hear the law are righteous before God, rather those who do the law will be declared to be righteous.

罗 2:13（原来在　神面前、不是听律法的为义、乃是行律法的称义。

Romans 2:14  For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, not having the law, they are a law for themselves.

罗 2:14没有律法的外邦人、若顺着本性行律法上的事、他们虽然没有律法、自己就是自己的律法。

Romans 2:15 They reveal the work of the law written in their hearts, their consciences witnessing, now accusing, now defending each other.

罗 2:15这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里、他们是非之心同作见证、并且他们的思念互相较量、或以为是、或以为非)

Romans 2:16 On the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.

罗 2:16就在　神借耶稣基督审判人隐秘事的日子、照着我的福音所言。

Romans 2:17 Now, if you call yourself a Jew, if you rely on the law and brag in relationship to God,

罗 2:17你称为犹太人、又倚靠律法、且指着　神夸口。

Romans 2:18 If you know the will and approve of what is best, instructed by the law.

罗 2:18既从律法中受了教训、就晓得　神的旨意、也能分别是非、（或作也喜爱那美好的事）

Romans 2:19 If you remain convinced you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness.

罗 2:19又深信自己是给瞎子领路的、是黑暗中人的光、

Romans 2:20  An instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of infants because, in connection with the law, you have the substance of knowledge and the truth.

罗 2:20是蠢笨人的师傅、是小孩子的先生、在律法上有知识和真理的模范。

Romans 2:21 You, the one teaching others, do you not teach yourself? The one preaching against stealing, do you steal?

罗 2:21你既是教导别人、还不教导自己么。你讲说人不可偷窃、自己还偷窃么。1

Romans 2:22 You, the one saying, do not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You, the one detesting idols, do you rob temples?

罗 2:22 你说人不可奸淫、自己还奸淫么。你厌恶偶像、自己还偷窃庙中之物么。

Romans 2:23 You who make your boast in the law, through setting aside the law, do you dishonor God?

罗 2:23你指着律法夸口、自己倒犯律法、玷辱　神么。

Romans 2:24 It's written, the name of God, because of you, is blasphemed among the Gentiles.

罗 2:24神的名在外邦人中、因你们受了亵渎、正如经上所记的。

Romans 2:25 Circumcision is valuable if you keep the law, but if you walk outside the law, your circumcision is as if you remained uncircumcised.

罗 2:25你若是行律法的、割礼固然于你有益。若是犯律法的、你的割礼就算不得割礼。

Romans 2:26 If the uncircumcised guard the provisions of the law, will not their uncircumcision be considered as if they were circumcised?

罗 2:26所以那未受割礼的、若遵守律法的条例、他虽然未受割礼、岂不算是有割礼么。

Romans 2:27   That one will condemn you, though physically uncircumcised and yet completes the law, you who have what's written including circumcision but walk contrary to the law.

罗 2:27而且那本来未受割礼的、若能全守律法、岂不是要审判你这有仪文和割礼竟犯律法的人么。

Romans 2:28 One is not a Jew only outwardly nor, outwardly, in the flesh only is circumcision.

罗 2:28 因为外面作犹太人的、不是真犹太人、外面肉身的割礼、也不是真割礼。

Romans 2:29 Rather one, on the inside, is a Jew and circumcision of the heart, in connection with the Spirit not by a code. Such a man's praise is not from men but from God.

罗 2:29 惟有里面作的、才是真犹太人。真割礼也是心里的、在乎灵不在乎仪文。这人的称赞、不是从人来的、乃是从　神来的。

##### B. NOTES 笔记

Verses 1-3   No one is excusable for when we judge others, using the same criteria, all along the line, we are judging ourselves. For, if the truth be told, we do the same things, the things worthy of God's judgment. God is consistent in his judging. It's consistently based on what God established as his unchanging decree. And so, with certainty, God's judgment falls on those who act contrary to his established truth. Human thinking becomes vain and illogical when it judges others for the same things we do and thinks, somehow, we, but not others, will escape the judgment from God we, too, deserve.alt

1-3节 没人是可以推诿的，因为我们在论断人时，我们一直在同样的标准定自己的罪。因为如果我们已经知道真理，我们还做同样的事，同样的让上帝审判的事。上帝的审 判是一致的，一直建立在上帝确定不变的命令上。因此，上帝的审判肯定要落在那些行事和上帝确立的真理向左的人身上。当我们和他人行同样的事并因此论断人， 而且认为我们而不是别人会逃脱上帝对我们应有的审判，我们的想法是虚空而且不合逻辑的。

Verses 4-5   In being so critical of others, judgmental of all they're doing, while doing the same things, don't we recognize the kindness of God in not judging us severely? Don't we recognize the patience and tolerance of God in not condemning our sin, but forgiving it? For after God points out our sin to us, his whole intention is to lead us toward repentance. In stubbornly refusing, in repentance, to turn to God, it's not freedom we are gaining. Rather we are storing up for ourselves God's wrath when God's righteous judgment is at last revealed.

4-5节 对别人如此吹毛求疵，论断他们的作为，同时自己却在做同样的事，难道我们没 有意识到上帝没有对我们进行严厉审判的仁慈吗？难道我们没有意识到上帝没有定我们的罪而是饶恕我们的罪的耐心和宽容吗？因为上帝在指出我们的罪后，他的整 个意图就是领我们悔改。顽固地拒绝悔改转向上帝，我们所获得的不是自由。我们实在为自己积蓄上帝显他公义审判的日子来到时的忿怒。

Verses 6   God's justice makes no mistakes. Those whose work it was to despise God and disdain his gracious offer will receive his righteous judgment. Those whose "work" it was to believe in him will enjoy his gracious favor, the product of God's work to bring us to faith in him.

6节 神的公义无可指责，那些在行为上藐视神并且蔑视他的恩典的人会得到应有的报应。那些相信神并且喜欢他的恩典的人，那些在“行为上”相信上帝的人会喜爱他的恩典，上帝的作为的结果使我们相信他。

Verses 7- 11   God does not play favorites. There is nothing special in any of us to attract his attention. And because God, in dealing with us, deals with us all the same way, in grace, the result is there can be no favoritism with God.

7-11 上帝不偏待人，我们任何人都没有什么特别可以吸引他注意的。由于上帝对我们所有的人在恩典上一视同仁，结果是上帝不偏待人。

Verses 12- 13    God has only one standard for judging. It's disobedience to his will as expressed in the Law. The holy will of God   is expressed in written and unwritten from. The law was written on man's heart. The law was written on two tablets of stone. In either case human are judged for not complying with its provisions.

12-13 上帝审判人的标准只有一个，就是律法里所讲的不顺从神的旨意，上帝的神圣的旨意有成文律法和不成文律法，律法写在人的心里，律法写在两块石板上，不管怎样，人都会因没能遵从规定而受审判。

It is not enough to know the law, to be familiar with its provisions. Rather, if we are going to be declared righteous before God by complying with the law, we would need to actually do what it says. But, as we shall hear more later, there is no one who is able to be declared righteous before God by keeping the law. No one keeps the law perfectly which is what God would require.

了解律法熟知条款是不够的，如果我们想要通过遵从律法在上帝面前称义的话，我们需要确实地做律法所讲的。但是，我们下面会听到，没有人在上帝面前可以通过守律法而称义。没人能够完全地守住律法，而这恰是上帝所要求的。

Verses 15-18 Though people have refused to accept the testimony of God, they are actually in agreement with it. This inner agreement is the voice of their inner self-knowledge, the voice of conscience. How often the voice of conscience is heard, inwardly or externally, as they use it to defend their actions or to disapprove of the activity of others. Their guilty reactions actually confirm the reality of God's holy will, expressed in the inner voice of conscience.

15-18节 虽然人拒绝上帝的见证，他们其实是赞同的，他们内在的赞同就是他们内在的自我认识的声音，良心的声音。他们用良心为自己的行为分辨或反驳别人的行为时，他们常常听到内在或外在的听到良心的声音。

Verses 19-21 In the mind of the self-righteous Jew, the matter was settled, there could be no debate. With what he knew, it was obvious, he thought he knew more than all the rest, especially the unenlightened Gentiles. And so he was the certified guide for the blind, he was the sole light for those who still were in darkness, lacking the complete knowledge of God.

19-21节 在自义的犹太人心里，事情解决了，不能再有争辩，很显然，凭着他的知识，他认为他所知道的比其他人都多，尤其是未开化的外邦人，所以他是认定的给瞎子领路的向导，是那些对上帝缺少完全认识的仍在黑暗中的人的唯一的光、

Verse 22   Let's get specific. You mouth the right words, do not commit adultery, do not practice idolatry. And on the surface, to an outside observer, it might appear you keep the 6th and 1st commandments. But, on the inside, the keeping of the commandments of God is more than knowing them, teaching them. It's living them.

22 我们明确点讲。你说的话是正确的：不可奸淫，不可拜偶像。表面上，对一个外面的观察者，看似你在守第6条和第1条戒命。但是，内在地守上帝的戒命比知道或教导他们更重要，也就是要活出戒命。

Verses 23-24 While we can add nothing to God's great name, when we set aside what clearly is his will, ignoring the provisions of his law, we are actually causing God's name to be dishonored, That's the sad result when we teach God's law and live contrary to it.

23-24 虽然我们不能为上帝的大名增添什么，当我们把明显是他的愿望置于不顾忽略他的律法的规定时，我们实际上在羞辱上帝的名，当我们教导上帝的律法而行为与之相悖时，这就是那可悲的结局。

Verses 25-27   Paul uses circumcision to illustrate his point. There is some value in being circumcised in keeping with the provisions of God's law. However, if you walk alongside the law, ignoring its provision, even if you are circumcised it's as if you remained uncircumcised. Circumcision does you absolutely no good at all. It's just like the law. It serves no God-intended purpose, if knowing it, you walk contrary to it.

25-27 保罗用割礼说明他的观点。如果我们遵从上帝的律法的规定，割礼有点价值，可是，如果我们和律法同行却不顾律法的规定，即使我们受了割礼，也如同未受割礼，割礼于我们毫无益处。就像律法一样，如果我们知道律法却违背律法，律法不能满足上帝的目的。

Verses 28-29   Ethnicity, just like circumcision, is not only something outward, something physical. A true Jew is something deeper, just like circumcision is something more than the physical. What can be seen is no match for what remains unseen, for matters of the heart.

28-29 民族和割礼一样，不仅仅是外在的肉体的，真正的犹太人是深层次的，正如割礼不仅仅是肉身的一样。能看见的无法与看不见的相比内心。
