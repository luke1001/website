##### A. TRANSLATION ROMANS 3:1-31 翻译《罗马书》3:1-31

Romans 3:1 What, then, the advantage of being a Jew or what value in circumcision?

罗3:1这样说来、犹太人有什么长处、割礼有什么益处呢。

Roman 3:2 Much in every way. Foremost, they have been entrusted with the words of God.

罗3:2 凡事大有好处。第一是　神的圣言交托他们。

Romans 3:3 What if some did not believe? Will their faithlessness void the faithfulness of God?

罗3:3即便有不信的、这有何妨呢。难道他们的不信、就废掉　神的信么。

Romans 3:4  It can't be! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it stands written: That you may be judged correct when you speak and be victorious in your judging.

罗3:4 断乎不能。不如说、　神是真实的、人都是虚谎的。如经上所记、“你责备人的时候、显为公义。被人议论的时候、可以得胜。”

Romans 3:5 If our unrighteousness causes God's righteousness to stand out more clearly, what shall I say, God is not righteous in bringing his wrath? I'm talking like a human.

罗3:5 我且照着人的常话说、我们的不义、若显出　神的义来、我们可以怎么说呢。　神降怒、是他不义么。

Romans 3:6 It can't be! If it was, how could God judge the world?

罗3:6 断乎不是。若是这样、　神怎能审判世界呢。

Romans 3:7 If my falseness enhanced the truthfulness of God his glory, why am I still judged a sinner?

罗3:7 若　神的真实、因我的虚谎、越发显出他的荣耀、为什么我还受审判、好像罪人呢。

Romans3:8 Why not, as we are being slandered, as some claim we say, "Do evil that good may come of it"? Their judgment is just.

罗3: 8 为什么不说、我们可以作恶以成善呢、这是毁谤我们的人、说我们有这话。这等人定罪、是该当的。

Romans 3:9 What then? Are we superior? No way! For we made the charge Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.

罗3:9 这却怎么样呢。我们比他们强么。决不是的。因我们已经证明、犹太人和希腊人都在罪恶之下。

Romans 3:10 As it is written: "There is not righteous one, not even one."

罗3:10就如经上所记、“没有义人、连一个也没有。

Romans 3:11 There is not one who understands, not one seeking God.

罗3:11没有明白的、没有寻求　神的。

Romans 3:12 All have turned away, they have become useless; there is no one doing good, not even one.

罗3:12   都是偏离正路、一同变为无用。没有行善的、连一个也没有。

Romans 3:13 Opened graves are their throats; their tongues practice lying. The poison of snakes on their lips.

罗3:13 他们的喉咙是敞开的坟墓。他们用舌头弄诡诈。嘴唇里有虺蛇的毒气。

Romans 3:14 Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.

罗3:14满口是咒骂苦毒。

Romans 3:15 Ready their feet are to shed blood.

罗3:15 杀人流血他们的脚飞跑。

Romans 3:16 Destruction and distress are in their paths.

罗3:16 所经过的路、便行残害暴虐的事。

Romans 3:17 The way of peace they don't know.

罗3:17 平安的路、他们未曾知道。

Romans 3:18 There is no respect for God in front of their eyes

罗3:18 他们眼中不怕　神。”.

Romans 3:19 We know whatever the law says to those in connection with the law it speaks that every mouth may be shut and the whole world held accountable to God.

罗3:19 我们晓得律法上的话、都是对律法以下之人说的、好塞住各人的口、叫普世的人都伏在　神审判之下。

Romans 3:20 Therefore by keeping the law no mortal will be declared righteous in God's sight, rather, by way of the law, we become aware of our sin.

罗3:20 所以凡有血气的没有一个、因行律法、能在　神面前称义。因为律法本是叫人知罪。

Romans 3:21 But now a righteousness of God has been made known, witnessed by the law and prophets.

罗3:21但如今　神的义在律法以外已经显明出来、有律法和先知为证。

Romans 3:22   This righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no difference.

罗3:22 就是　神的义、因信耶稣基督、加给一切相信的人、并没有分别。

Romans 3:23 All have sinned and are fallen short of the glory of God.

罗3:23 因为世人都犯了罪、亏缺了　神的荣耀。

Romans 3:24 And are declared innocent, freely by his grace by way of the redemption in connection with Christ Jesus.

罗3:24 如今却蒙　神的恩典、因基督耶稣的救赎、就白白的称义。

Romans 3:25 God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement through faith in his blood to demonstrate his justice through his passing   by sins committed before in his forbearance.

罗3:25神设立耶稣作挽回祭、是凭着耶稣的血、借着人的信、要显明　神的义。因为他用忍耐的心、宽容人先时所犯的罪。

Romans 3:26 For a demonstration of his justice at the present time, that he be just and the justifier of the ones having faith in Jesus.

罗3:26 好在今时显明他的义、使人知道他自己为义、也称信耶稣的人为义。

Romans 3:27 Where then is boasting? It's excluded. On what   basis? By observing   the law, by no means, rather on the basis of faith.

罗3:27既是这样、那里能夸口呢。没有可夸的了。用何法没有的呢、是用立功之法么。不是、乃用信主之法

Romans 3:28 We conclude that declared innocent is a person by faith without the deeds of the law.

罗3:28 所以（有古卷作因为）我们看定了、人称义是因着信、不在乎遵行律法。

Romans 3:29 The Jew's God only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, also the Gentiles.

罗3:29 难道　神只作犹太人的　神么。不也是作外邦人的　神么。是的、也作外邦人的　神。

Romans 3:30 Since there is one God who will justify the circumcision by means of faith and the uncircumcision through faith.

罗3:30 神既是一位、他就要因信称那受割礼的为义、也要因信称那未受割礼的为义。

Romans 3:31 Do we make the law useless through faith? By no means! Rather we confirm the law.

罗3:31 这样、我们因信废了律法么。断乎不是、更是坚固律法。

##### B. NOTES: 笔记

Verses 1-2   People might think, just listening to Paul, that he has downgraded the worth of being a Jew or being circumcised. To jump to that conclusion would be to miss the point of Paul entirely. Paul cannot say it strongly enough. In every way there is an advantage in being a true Jew, one circumcised in the flesh and heart. For to Abraham's descendents was entrusted the written record of God's truth.

1-2节 光听保罗的话，人们可能会以为他降低了犹太人和割礼的价值。匆忙下这样的结论是完全没有领会保罗的要点。保罗表达的不能再充分了。做一个肉身和心灵都受割礼的真正的犹太人在任何方面都有优势，因为上帝把上帝的真理用文字记录的任务托给了亚伯拉罕的后裔。

Verses 3-8   Paul asks a good question. What effect upon God does human faithlessness have? Can our faithfulnesses cancel or render ineffective the faithfulness of God? It could never be that something lacking in humans could negate something positive in God. In the end, it will be true, in whatever God says, in whatever way he judges, his statements are never false, his judgment can never be overthrown.

3-8节 保罗问了一个好问题，人的不信对神有什么影响呢？我们的不信能够废掉神的信或使神的信无效么？人所缺的从不能取消神所有的。最终，不管上帝说了什么，不管他如何审判，他的话永远无误，他的审判永远不会被推翻，这是实在的。

If in contrast with our unrighteousness God righteousness stands out all the more clearly, would God be unjust if he brought his wrath to bear on our unrighteousness? There is no way that God's righteous judgment on our unrighteousness makes him unjust for condemning us. It just more clearly reveals his justice.

如果和我们的不义相比，上帝的义愈发突出，上帝因我们的不义而降怒，上帝是不是不义呢？上帝对我们的不义所作的公义的审判绝不会使他因定我们的罪而不公。这只是更清楚地显示他的义。

There is a stark contrast between the truthfulness of God and our own falsehood. But we are not given credit for enhancing God's truthfulness when it shines more brightly by contrast with our imperfection. Rather our falseness still justly condemns us.

上帝的真实和我们的虚谎截然相对。当上帝的真实和我们的不完美相比较越发光彩夺目，我们不会因为增加他的荣耀而得到赞扬。我们的虚谎仍是我们定罪的正当理由。

Verse 9-10   It’s so easy for all of us to want to feel superior to others. Here, for God, Paul levels us all. The conclusion is we all are in this together, no one any better than anyone else by nature. All together we are guilty and deserving of God's eternal penalty. It should come as no surprise to anyone then, how God views the whole, fallen human race. And it is as true as when it first was written. There is not a single, solitary person anywhere who stands righteous, as perfectly holy as God expects, not even one.

9-10节 我们很容易想要比他人强。在这里，保罗为了上帝的缘故把我们全部拉平。结 论是我们都处于同样的情况，从本性上没人比他人好。我们大家一起都有罪，配得上帝的永罚。上帝如何看整个堕落的人类的一点都不惊奇。现在跟经上一开始记下 的一样真实。没有一个象上帝所期望的那样完全圣洁的义人，连一个也没有。

Verses 11-17    There is no one, really, who is seeking God as he wants to be known. All man's seeking for a god is a fabrication of his own imagination, a god in his own image. All have turned away from God and doing his will. The throats of mortals are like life-less graves. It's soon evident when you hear them speak. Their words kill. When sinful mortals, with sin-corrupted hearts speak, what comes flying out of their full mouths is disgusting: foul language, cursing, revealing the bitterness they feel and too willingly express. The content of their sin-corrupted hearts makes them miserable people, self-destructive. However, in their wickedness they strike out at others. They are only too ready to go any distance to harm others, even to the point of shedding people's blood, hurting, harming, killing them.

11-17节 没有一个人按神所希望被了解的寻求神。所有人的寻求神都是自己想象的复 制，一个他自身形象的上帝。所有人都偏离神，按自己的意愿行事。活人的喉咙是无生命的坟墓。当你听到他们说话时，这一点很快就显而易见了。他们的话杀人， 当心被罪玷污的罪人说话时，他们满嘴飞出的话是令人厌恶的：脏话、骂人的话，显示了他们随心所表达的苦毒。他们被罪玷污的心的满足使他们成为可怜的自我毁 灭的人。由于他们的邪恶，他们攻击他人，他们愿意做一切伤害他人，甚至到使人流血的地步，伤害人、使人受伤、杀害人。

Verses 17-18    With all that Paul was inspired to relate, this sinful, self-chosen path can have only one continuous and final result. Another spokesman for God recorded it also. "There is no peace says my God for the wicked." When what you think and speak, the way you act is contrary to God's way, the way of peace ca not possibly be known.

17-18节 讲完这些后，保罗受圣灵所感，讲到这个充满罪的自我选择的路只能有一个持续的终结的结果，上帝的另一位代言人也记录到：“我的神说恶者没有平安。”当你的所想，所说和行事方式与上帝的路相左时，平安的路就不能有。

Verses 19-20   If we cannot keep the law, why did God even give us the law? The law speaks a powerful message to every human being. It shuts up our proud boasting; it leaves no one unexcused before God. It plainly underscores that we all are accountable to God. Here is the bottom line. Because of everything that has gone before, every dimension of human waywardness from God in thought, word and deed, there is just no way, on their own, any human can be declared just before God. The Law's purpose, then, for us, is to expose our sinfulness.

19-20节 如果我们不能守住律法，为什么上帝还要给我们律法？律法对每个人宣讲了一个大能的信息，它阻止了我们骄傲的自夸，它使人在上帝面前无可推委。它清楚地强调 我们都对上帝负责，这是底线。由于以前所发生的一切，人在思想、言语和行为上偏离上帝的任性的任一方面，人靠自己没有任何办法可以在上帝面前称义。律法对 我们的目的就是暴露我们的罪。

Verses 21-22 In contrast to everything human along comes God's own righteousness. It’s a righteousness, as a gift, God wants to bestow on humans which God has always communicated. The testimony to it is found in the law and prophets, the entire Old Testament. God found his own unique way to transmit his righteousness to humans. They could not earn it so he would give it away. Through faith in Jesus Christ, itself a gift of God, God bestows his righteousness impartially to all.

21-22节 和人的一切相比显示的是上帝自己的义，正如上帝一直向我们传达的，这个 义是上帝想作为礼物赠送给人的。这个见证可以从律法和众先知，可以从整个旧约里找到。上帝用他独特的方法把他的义传给人。 人无法挣得神的义，所以神才赐下义。通过信耶稣，这本身就是上帝的礼物，上帝公正地把他的义赠给了人。

Verses 23-24   Here is the first great universal truth repeated, one that is true for every last human being. All have sinned, missing the mark of perfection God has set for all of us. Consequently, by nature, we all fall far short of the glory of God, unable to be perfect as God demands. Here is the second great truth. God declares us to be innocent, righteous before him, freely. It's entirely his gift to us though it cost him a great deal. The price he paid is the redemption, the costly sacrifice, made by Jesus Christ.

23-24节 这里重复了第一个伟大的普遍真理，对每个人来说都是真理。世人都犯了罪，都没达到上帝为我们设定的完美的标准。因此，从本性上说，我们都亏缺了神的荣耀， 不能做到上帝所要求的完美。这就有了第二个伟大的真理，上帝宣称我们是无罪的，在他面前白白的称义。这完全是上帝赐给我们的礼物，为此他付出极大的代价。 他所付的代价是通过耶稣基督的昂贵的牺牲所做的救赎。

Verses 25 -26   God could not let sin remain unpunished and still remain the holy and righteous God. And so God ordained a sacrifice that brought atonement. It was the sacrifice of his own innocent son. And so, from the fall of Adam until the last curtain of the world's existence, God, in patient, pardoning love, left the payment for our sins on Christ's shoulders. God should not have to prove anything to anyone. And yet, within sight of humans, God does demonstrate his sense of justice. He remains just, not allowing sin to be unpunished. But, at the same time, he justifies the ungodly, providing the full satisfaction for them to be forgiven.

25-26节 上帝不能让罪不受惩罚，上帝仍是圣洁公义的神。因此，上帝命令了赎罪祭，这是把他无罪的儿子作为献祭。因此，从亚当的堕落到世界存在的最后的帷幕，上帝用 他耐心的饶恕的爱使我们的罪的偿付落到了耶稣的肩上。上帝不用向任何人证明什么。可是，在人的可见范围内，上帝确实显示了他的公义感。他一直都是公义的， 不允许罪不被惩罚，但同时，他使不敬神的人称义，使他们得到被饶恕的完全的满足。

Verses 27-28    Humans are always looking for something in us to boast about. Here boasting is completely ruled out. What rules it out? Nothing in us, rather it is faith, the gift of God which makes it all possible. As Paul said elsewhere, "May I never boast except in the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ.

27-28节 人总是在找我们身上可以夸口的。这里夸口被完全排除了，什么讲他排除的呢？不是我们自身的缘故，而是上帝的礼物信仰使得夸口不可能。正如保罗在别处说道：“除了在我主耶稣基督身上，愿我永不夸口。”

This has been a spectacular section, highlighting the undeserved grace of God! Because what God intends to do for us is so out of altthe ordinary, so contrary to human nature, God, through his sacred writers, cannot rule out often enough that merit has nothing to do with grace . Here, Paul says it again. Justification is an act of God exclusively, having nothing to do with any works on our part.

这是一节绝美的经文部分，强调了我们不配得的上帝的恩典。上帝为我们所打算的是如此异乎寻常，和人性如此相左，上帝通过他圣经的作者们常常强调一点，即人的优点（善行）和恩典无关。这里保罗又一次说了这一点。称义是上帝独自的行为，和我们的任何行为无关。

Verses 29-31   Still human pride persists. The Jews wonder about the inclusion in their exclusive club of the Gentiles. But, as is repeated here, there is no favoritism with God. He is the God of all, Jews and Gentiles alike. There is only one God, the same God for all, with the same method of justifying everyone. For those who came to God being circumcised, it’s still through faith that they are declared innocent before God. And for those who were uncircumcised when they came to know God, it's also through faith that they, too, are justified.

29-31节 人的骄傲仍然继续。犹太人奇怪为何会包含他们一向大棒排斥在外的外邦人。但是，正如这里所重复的，上帝不偏待人。他是所有人的上帝，犹太人和外邦人一样。 只有一个上帝，大家一样的上帝，使每人称义的方法一样。对那些受了割礼来到上帝面前的人，仍然是通过信他们才会在上帝面前称义。对那些未受割礼来到上帝面 前的人，也是通过信他们才会在上帝面前称义。

With all that has been said about faith, it might seem there is no place for the law. But nothing could be further from the truth. When the gospel reveals the father's grace, it was all because the law revealed there was no other way that we could become the children of God.

讲了所有关于信的这一切，似乎律法没有任何位置，那就大大偏离事实的真相。当福音显示上帝父的恩典时，全是因为律法显示我们没有其他途径可以成为上帝的儿女。
