Lesson 10： Using The Law And Gospel In Our Preaching And Teaching
The Two Great Truths Of The Bible
圣经的两大真理
——律法与福音——
Lesson 10: Using The Law And Gospel In Our Preaching And Teaching
第十课 律法与福音在讲道与教学中的应用
A. Knowing And Using The Law And Gospel Properly Is Essential For Those Who Want To Be Faithful Messengers Of God’s True Word
正确理解恰当运用律法与福音，对于神的真道之忠实的传扬者来说至关重要
The proper distinguishing and application of the two great truths of the law and the gospel is of primary importance in the ministry of God’s Word to people’s lives.
恰当区分与应用律法与福音两大真理是福音事工的关键
“The distinction between law and gospel is the supreme art in Christianity, which all who glory in and bear the Christian name may and should understand. If this ability is lacking, one cannot tell a Christian from a non-Christian; of such importance is this matter. Place the person who is able properly to distinguish the law from the gospel at the head of the list and call him a Doctor of Holy Scripture.” (Dr. Martin Luther)
“在基督信仰中，正确区分律法与福音是最高超的艺术，是所有享有基督徒名分并以此为荣的人都可以而且应该领会的。缺少这项技能，便无法将基督徒从非基督徒中区分出来，其重要性正是如此。要尊能恰当地从福音中区分出律法的人为大，并称其为圣经博士。”（马丁路德 博士）
Any questions or Comments?
Much of the preaching that Luther grew up on was useless opinions; allegory; nothing like the sort of preaching that uses Law and Gospel as they should be used to build faith in God’s people.
“The distinction between the law and the gospel is ‘a special brilliant light, which serves to accomplish the goal that God’s Word may be correctly handled and the Scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles may be properly explained and understood.” (Formula of Concord, Thorough Declaration: Article V, Section 1)
“正确区分律法与福音就象一种特殊的亮光，照耀我们正确理解神的话语、恰当解释和领会先知们和使徒们（所写）的圣经。”
This is a quote from the confessions of the Lutheran Church of the Reformation. It was published in the year 1580. This study of Law and Gospel is a very valuable study which has continual application for the ministry of preparing and bringing a message from God’s Word to the people we serve.
“Carelessly throwing law and gospel together in a sermon is like throwing building supplies in a pile and calling it a house.”
在一篇布道讲章中将律法与福音随意丢在一起，就如同将一堆杂乱无章的建筑材料称作房屋。
My seminary professor (I. Habeck) when teaching us the art of sermon writing, shared with us that on one occasion he told his wife: “Writing and delivering a sermon is like having a baby!” His wife replied: “Obviously, you have never had a baby!” He replied: “Obviously, you have never written a sermon.”
B. A Method For Preparing A Scriptural Sermon That Is Sound In Doctrine
预备一篇符合教义的布道讲章的方法
1. Translation
翻译
QUESTION(S): How do you determine what the Hebrew or the Greek mean? Are you able to translate? Do you depend on a certain published translation? ARE THERE VARIOUS TRANSLATIONS WHICH YOU CAN COMPARE WITH EACH OTHER SO THAT IF YOU CANNOT READ THE HEBREW AND GREEK, YOU CAN DETERMINE WITH SOME CERTAINTY WHAT THE ORIGINAL MEANS? Are there people you can confer with if you are not sure?
Student (Yin) responded: there are several translations; not a word for word translation of Hebrew and Greek as study bible.
2. Text Notes
经文注解
QUESTION(S):
COMMENT: This includes comparing this text with other scriptures which relate to it. In the parable of the sower and the seed, Jesus compares the Word of God to seed that is planted into the soil. When studying this text, you can use what St. Peter writes in 1 Peter 1:23 – there he calls the Word of God an imperishable seed. James 1:21 says the Word has been planted in you and is able to save your soul.
3. Preaching Values
讲道意义
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S): Preaching on a certain text on a certain day will result in a sermon with emphasis on certain truths in the text because of the occasion or the congregation to whom the preacher brings the message.
The preacher who looks for preaching values is asking
1）“What do God’s people need to learn FROM THIS TEXT today?”
2）“How do the lessons found in this text need to be presented at this time and in this place?”
3） Example: Two Sundays ago I preached on the appointed Gospel – John 10 – just after the Dalai Lama had made a visit in our country. I used the text to teach that Jesus is the only Gate – the only Savior. The Dalai Lama is not an option to be our Savior.
4. Text Analysis
经文分析
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S): Look at the context of the verses (text) which form the basis of the message you want to bring.
5. Thematic Statement
主题陈述
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S):
The thematic statement is the title of the sermon. It summarizes the intended sermon in one sentence or phrase. It helps the preacher to focus on one direction.
This is the “rifle” (direct and focused approach) rather than the “shotgun” (scatter-gun approach).
6. Sermon Goal
讲道目的
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S):
This aspect of our preparation forces us to ask:
“What is the purpose of this message?”
a. Is the purpose teaching?
b. Is it to emphasize mission work?
c. Do I aim to comfort the grieving?
d. Do I want to motivate them to repent of some sinful behavior?
e. Will it motivate God’s people to a specific aspect of sanctification (living the Christian life)?
7. Specific Law (To convince of sin)
特定的律法（确认罪）
COMMENT: This is the function of the law we call “mirror” – See Romans 3:20. Paul used specific law in his letters to the specific churches. I can’t think of any specific law in the Book of Romans – for that letter was not written to a church Paul had founded. But the letters like Galatians and Corinthians are filled with specific law [and gospel] messages.
QUESTION: Ahab and Jezebel stole Nathan’s vineyard and killed Nathan in the process (1 Kings 21). What specific sin can this text be used to expose and condemn?
8. Specific Law (To lead to godly action)
特定的律法（引导虔诚的行为）
COMMENT: This is the use of the law we call “guide” – See Psalm 119:105. Only the Christian will respond to the law when it is used in this way.
Question: Why is it necessary for the preacher to preach the gospel before using the law in this way? (See 2 Corinthians 5:14-15; Romans 12:1-2.) Answer: Because faith in the Gospel must motivate correct behavior. We want the behavior we are urging to be a fruit of faith in Jesus’ gospel promises.
9. Specific Gospel (To pardon and assure of salvation)
特定的福音（宽恕、确信救恩）
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S):
Example: If the preacher has convicted the hearers of being covetous, selfish and loveless, the specific gospel will proclaim the good news that God’s Son lived a perfectly selfless, loving life for them. In love he died cleanse them from their sins of lovelessness. See 2 Corinthians 8:9.
10. Specific Gospel (To supply spiritual desire and strength)
特定的福音（赐予属灵的力量与渴望）
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S):
Continuing the example: Jesus, who rose from the dead, lives to give you His Spirit through word and sacrament so that you have power to overcome your selfish heart and instead love your neighbor unselfishly and unconditionally. Titus 2:11 says this grace of God “teaches us to say ‘no’” to sinful desires and evil behavior.
11. Basic Sermon Outline
讲章大纲
QUESTION(S)/COMMENT(S):
Example:
John 10:1-10
JESUS, JESUS, ONLY JESUS
1. Only Jesus leads and feeds God’s Sheep (verses 1-6)
2. Only Jesus gives the overflowing life. (verses 7-10)
Note: The theme or title of the sermon is title of a well known hymn in our hymnal.
12. Sermon Building Material
讲章基本素材
COMMENT(S):
1. Illustrations.
2. Research on the historical background of the text.
3. Commentaries in the library or on the Internet.
4. Examples of messages created on the text by others
13. Expanded Sermon Outline
讲章大纲引申
Each main part may be subdivided and these may also be subdivided. Keep in mind the direction the sermon will move and keep the outline logical and clear.
C. Preparing A Scriptural Message With Law And Gospel
准备一篇律法与福音的信息
Work through the following Scripture texts to identify law and gospel points as you prepare for delivering a message to a group of people:
当你准备向人们传达一个信息时，你如何根据以下经文确认律法与福音重点？
1. Luke 18:9-14 The Parable Of The Pharisee And The Tax Collector
路加福音18:9-14 法利赛人与税吏的比喻
9) To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: 10) “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11) The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men – robbers, evildoers, adulterers – or even like this tax collector. 12) I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ 13) But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14) I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
9)耶稣向那些仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，10) “有两个人上殿里去祷告；一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。11)法利赛人站着，自言自语地祷告说：‘　神啊，我感谢你，我不象别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不象这个税吏。12)我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的，都捐上十分之一。’13)那税吏远远地站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：‘　神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！’14)我告诉你们，这人回家去，比那人倒算为义了；因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。”
a. Specific Law (To convince of sin)
特定的律法（确认罪）
The Pharisee prayed about himself (not to God). Pride and boasting in one’s own works, despising other people, trusts in his works to have favor with God. The tax collector was humble before God and requested God’s mercy on him. Jesus’ words: “the exalted will be humbled”
这个法利赛人只是在自言自语（而非向神祷告）。他自鸣得意、夸耀一己的好行为，藐视他人，相信可以凭行为得神的赏识。税吏则谦卑地在神面前乞求神的怜悯。耶稣说：“凡自高的，必降为卑。”
b. Specific Law (To lead to godly action)
特定的律法（引导虔诚的行为）
The tax collector prayed humbly to God.
税吏谦卑地向神祷告。
c. Specific Gospel (To pardon and assure of salvation)
特定的福音（宽恕、确信救恩）
Jesus declared the tax collector to be justified and pardoned. Jesus’ words: “the humble will be exalted”
耶稣称税吏为义、得宽恕。耶稣说：“自卑的，必升为高。”
d. Specific Gospel (To supply spiritual desire and strength)
特定的福音（赐予属灵的力量与渴望）
The justified tax collector was assured that his prayer was heard
被称为义的税吏确悉他的祷告蒙神垂听。
2. Galatians 3:10-14 “The Curse Of The Law And Redemption By Christ”
加拉太书3:10-14 律法的咒诅与基督的救赎
10) All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law. 11) Clearly no one is justified before God by observing the law, because, ‘The righteous will live by faith.’ 12) The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, ‘The man who does these things will live by them.’ 13) Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: ‘Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.’ 14) He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
10)凡以行律法为本的，都是被咒诅的；因为经上记着：“凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。”11)没有一个人靠着律法在　神面前称义，这是明显的；因为经上说：“义人必因信得生。” 12) 律法原不本乎信，只说：“行这些事的，就必因此活着。”13)基督既为我们受了咒诅(“受”原文作“成”)，就赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅；因为经上记着：“凡挂在木头上都是被咒诅的。” 14) 这便叫亚伯拉罕的福，因基督耶稣可以临到外邦人，使我们因信得着所应许的圣灵。
a. Specific Law (To convince of sin)
特定的律法（确认罪）
v. 10 the curse on those who rely on the law, v, 11 “no one is justified by keeping the law”, v. 12 the demands of obedience to the law
第十节，以律法为本的人当被咒诅。第十一节，“无人靠着律法称义。”第十二节，要求顺从律法。
b. Specific Law (To lead to godly action)

The general warning not to keep the law of do good work for the purpose of earning salvation
警告：不可凭着遵从律法而赚得救恩。
c. Specific Gospel (To pardon and assure of salvation)

v. 11b “the righteous will live by faith, vs. 13-14 “Christ redeemed from the curse by becoming a curse for us. He redeemed us that the blessing might come to the Geniles through Christ Jesus, By faith we receive the promise of the Spirit.”
第十一节，“义人必因信得生。”第十三、十四节，基督既为我们受了咒诅(“受”原文作“成”)，就赎出我们脱离律法的咒诅；这便叫亚伯拉罕的福，因基督耶稣可以临到外邦人，使我们因信得着所应许的圣灵。
d. Specific Gospel (To supply spiritual desire and strength)
特定的福音（赐予属灵的力量与渴望）
No specific gospel for supplying spiritual desire and strength is in this text.
这一章节中没有特别应用于赐属灵力量与渴望的福音。
3. Luke 17;11-19 “The Healing Of The Ten Lepers”
路加福音17;11-19 “治好十个麻风病人”
11) Now on His way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. 12) As He was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance 13) and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” 14) When He saw them, He said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed. 15) One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 16) He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked Him – and He was a Samaritan. 17) Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18) Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” 19) Then He said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has make you well.”
11)耶稣往耶路撒冷去，经过撒玛利亚和加利利。12)进入一个村子，有十个长大麻风的，迎面而来，远远地站着，13) 高声说：“耶稣，夫子，可怜我们吧！” 14) 耶稣看见，就对他们说：“你们去，把身体给祭司察看。”他们去的时候就洁净了。15)内中有一个见自己已经好了，就回来大声归荣耀与　神。16) 又俯伏在耶稣脚前感谢他。这人是撒玛利亚人。17)耶稣说：“洁净了的不是十个人吗？那九个在哪里呢？18) 除了这外族人，再没有别人回来归荣耀与　神吗？”19)就对那人说：“起来，走吧！你的信救了你了。”

D. Recognizing Errors People Make About Law And Gospel
辨别题
Briefly indicate what is wrong about each of the following statements.
简要指出下列说法的错误
1. The 10 Commandments are the most important teaching in the Bible.
十诫是圣经中最重要的教导。
The Ten Commandments are a very important teaching of the Bible. They are the clear moral law of God. However, the gospel is even more important because it alone has the power to save sinners
十诫是圣经的重要教导，是来自神的清晰明确的道德律法。然而福音更为重要，唯独福音具有拯救罪人的权能。
2. God is satisfied that we keep His commandments the best we can.
神会满足于我们尽力遵行十诫。
God requires a perfect keeping of His commandment, not just the best we can do. See Leviticus 19:2 and Matthew 5:48. (James 2:10)
神要求我们完美无缺地遵行他的诫命，非尽力而为即可。参阅利未记 十九章二节，马太福音 五章四十八节。
3. God will save you through faith in Jesus Christ as long as you do your part and do not
reject Him.
只要你努力做好你该做的部分且不拒绝神，神就会通过你在耶稣基督里的信心而救赎你。
We do not add or contribute anything to our salvation and conversion. In our own natural spiritual condition, we refuse God and do not have the power to avoid rejecting Him.
我们不能为自身的转变与救赎作任何贡献。我们的属灵天性本能地拒绝神，我们没有能力改变这一景况。
4. The message of the gospel is that Jesus lived a wonderful life in order to show us how to live and to inspire us to live like Him.
福音信息是为了向我们展示并激励我们效法耶稣基督圣洁完美的生活榜样。
The message of the gospel is that Jesus Christ lived a perfect life of obedience for us and died to pay the full penalty for our sin. Jesus is a good example and guide for us, but His example and guidance is a teaching of the law and not the gospel.
福音信息是：耶稣基督为我们活出完全顺服的生命，他的死为我们的罪付上完全的代价。耶稣是我们的楷模与向导，然而这一典范与指引是律法教导，而不是福音。
5. Faith in Jesus Christ is both God’s gift and a person’s own decision.
在耶稣基督里的信心既是神的礼物也是个人的决定。
Faith in Jesus Christ is God’s pure gift to us. The Holy Spirit creates this faith in us. It is not our decision. By nature, we do not have the spiritual desire or power to choose for God.
在耶稣基督里的信心是神赐予我们的礼物。圣灵在我们的内心建立起这一信心而不是我们个人的决定。因着我们的天性，我们不会渴望也不具备这样的能力去选择接受神。
6. Good works are necessary for a person to be saved.
人若想得救，必须行善事。
Good works are the natural, necessary fruit of true, saving faith. However good works are not a meriting payment for our salvation.
善行是真正的信心结出的天然与必然的果实。善行不是我们为得救而支付的款项。
7. By nature there is some spiritual good and some spiritual bad in everyone.
从本质上讲，每个人的灵里有好的部分也有坏的部分。
By nature, we are only spiritually bad (sinful). However, people do have the produce good or bad outward behavior or morality.
因着天性（罪性），我们灵里是全然的败坏。只是人们表现出一些外在的善恶行为或道德而已。
8. By making salvation a free gift, God is encouraging people to live irresponsible, sinful lives.
神将救恩作为无偿的礼物赐予人类，其实是在鼓励人类随意犯罪。
By making salvation a free gift, God is encouraging thankful, obedient living. A person who truly knows that he/she is saved from sin and eternal death by God’s grace in Christ will fight against sin and not indulge in it.
神将救恩作为无偿的礼物赐予人类，是鼓励人们过感恩与顺服的生活。一个人真正懂得他/她是靠着神的恩典得救赎，脱离罪恶与永恒的死亡，他便不会在罪中放纵自己且与罪恶搏斗抗争。
9. The church’s primary mission is to provide moral training to its members.
教会的根本任务是对会员进行道德培训。
The primary mission of the church is to proclaim God’s Word and make disciples for Christ.
教会的根本任务是传扬神的道，带人归信基督。
10. Advanced Christians get to the point where they no longer sin.
基督徒中的先进分子可达到不再犯罪的境界。
In this world, Christians can make spiritual progress and sin less, but they do not and cannot become perfect until they reach heaven.
在进入天国之前，世上的基督徒可以有属灵的长进、较少地犯罪，却不可能达到完美。
Closing Thought
结束语
May God bless us all as we seek to better know and apply His teachings of law and gospel for the salvation and sanctification of those we serve.
愿神祝福我们，为了我们所服事的人的救恩与圣洁，让我们更好地理解与应用律法与福音的教导。
