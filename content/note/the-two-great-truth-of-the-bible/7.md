Lesson 8: Misuses Of The Law And Gospel
第八课 律法与福音的误用（续）
In this lesson, we will begin to examine some additional ways that the law and gospel are misused and misapplied to harm the spiritual lives of people
错误地运用律法与福音会严重危害人们的属灵生活。本课我们将继续审视与辨别某些误用律法与福音的方式。
A. Misuse 5: Universalism
误用5：普救论
1. Universalism is the false teaching that God loves people so much that He will save all people from their sins and give them eternal life apart from Spirit-worked sorrow for sin and faith in Jesus Christ.
普救论抛开圣灵使人认罪悔改的工作，抛开人们对耶稣基督的信靠，只讲神爱世人，神会救赎普天下所有的人脱离罪恶，并赐他们永生。
Comment: This misuse denies the law as a message that condemns people to hell.
2. Some examples of universalism are:
某些普救论的实例：
a. “We all worship the same God and are all going to the same heaven.”
“我们敬拜同一位神，进入同一个天国。”
b. “God loves sinners so much that He will not send anyone to hell.”
“神爱罪人，他不会让任何一个人下地狱。”
c. “All religions and philosophies will lead a person to God and eternal life.”
“所有的宗教与哲学都会带人相信神并且得永生。”
QUESTION: Have you heard people make any or all of these statements? Which one is the most common form of universalism where you live?
3. Universalism opposes the Bible’s teaching that God is a just and holy God who will punish sinners. It also dismisses the gospel of Jesus Christ as the necessary means of salvation.
普救论与圣经的教导——“公义圣洁的神将惩罚罪人”——相背离。普救论同样忽略了耶稣基督的福音才是救恩的根本途径。
- “Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished.” (Exodus 34:7b)
- 万不以有罪的为无罪。 (出埃及记 34:7b)
- “Whoever believes in God’s Son is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in God’s one and only Son.” (John 3:18)
- 信他的人，不被定罪；不信的人，罪已经定了，因为他不信　神独生子的名。(约翰福音 3:18)
- “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” (John 14:6)
- 耶稣说：“我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。”(约翰福音 14:6)
Question: Is the first passage [from Exodus] Law or Gospel? (Law)
Question: If God does not leave the guilty unpunished, why do we still know that we, guilty sinners, will escape His punishment?(Jesus suffered for us – Isaiah 53:5-6)
Question: According to the first passage from John (ch 3:18) what is the sin because of which people lose salvation and will be condemned? (The sin of unbelief)
B. Misuse 6: Synergism
误用6：协作论
1. Synergism is derived from two Greek words (“syn” and “ergo”) that literally mean “to work with.” Synergism is the false teaching that a person can and must cooperate with God in his/her coming to saving faith in Jesus Christ.
协作论源自两个希腊词语，义为“一同工作”。协作论错误地认为，一个人能够且必须与神协同工作来建立在耶稣基督里的信心。
2. Synergism is based on the faulty opinion that a person, is by nature, only spiritually impaired, and possesses the free will to accept or reject Jesus Christ as his/her Savior.
协同论基于一个错误观点，即一个人因着天性只是灵魂受损伤而已，且拥有自由意志或接受或拒绝耶稣基督为他/她的救主。
Question: Did God create Adam and Eve with free will? (Yes; they were “able not to sin” and they were also “able to sin”)
Question: How did we lose our “free will”? (When Adam and Eve chose to sin, they fell and we with them. In this fallen condition, we are “not able not to sin” – all we can do IS sin (Genesis 6:5) The inclination in all of us is to do what is evil. This is not free will; this is a will that is bound over to do what is sinful.
3. Some examples of synergism are:
某些协作论的实例：
a. “I know I am saved because I made my decision to accept Jesus as my Savior.
“我知道我被救赎，因为我已作出决定，接受耶稣为我的救主。”
Question: What part of this statement is wrong? (I made my decision to accept…)
See John 15:16 – you did not choose me… Matthew 22:14 – many are invited but few are chosen.
b. “God has sent Jesus to die for your sins. Now do your part and invite Jesus into your heart.”
“神已差遣耶稣为你的罪而死。现在，请完成你该做的那部分，邀请耶稣进入你的内心。”
{Ting mentioned THE ALTAR CALL as an example of the false teaching of free will}
c. “God will bring you to faith as long as you do not resist His working in you.”
“只要你不拒绝神在你内心的工作，神就会带领你相信他。”
4. Synergism contradicts the Bible teaching that all people, by nature are spiritually dead and have no free will to cooperate with God in spiritual matters prior to their conversion. Synergism also opposes the Bible’s teaching that God alone creates saving faith and spiritual life in people.
圣经教导一：人从本质上讲，灵里已死亡，不具备自由意志与神协同工作促成自身属灵的转变。
圣经教导二：唯有神在人的内部建立信心与属灵生命。
协同论与圣经的教导相矛盾。
- “As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, . . . Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions – it is by grace you have been saved.” (Ephesians 2:1, 3b-5)
-你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来 . . .本为可怒之子，和别人一样。然而　神既有丰富的怜悯，因他爱我们的大爱，当我们死在过犯中的时候，便叫我们与基督一同活过来(你们得救是本乎恩)。(以弗所书 2:1, 3b-5)
Any Questions?
C. Misuse 7: Adding Law Conditions To The Gospel
误用7：为福音附加律法条件
1. A common misuse of the law and gospel is to add law conditions to the message of the gospel. This improper mixing of law and gospel leads a person to abandon salvation by God’s grace and seek salvation by his/her works.
在福音信息上附加律法前提是一种常见的误用律法与福音的方式。混淆律法与福音会使人放弃依靠神的恩典得救恩，而靠自己的行为寻求救恩。
2. Some examples of adding law conditions to the gospel:
某些在福音之上附加律法前提的实例：
a. “Believe in Jesus and live a life of good works so that you can be saved.”
“相信耶稣且在生活中多行善事即可得救。”
b. “You will go to heaven if you have faith in Christ and follow God’s orders to worship regularly, respect the church leaders and give 10% of your income to the church.
“如果你相信基督，遵循神的指示定期崇拜，尊重教会领袖，将收入的十分之一捐给教会（十一奉献），你就可以进天堂。”
c. “God forgives people who are sorry for their sins, look to Jesus for forgiveness and do not repeat their past mistakes.”
“神宽恕这样的人：认罪悔改，寻求耶稣的宽恕，不再重犯以往的错误。”
3. Adding law conditions to the gospel opposes the Bible’s teaching that salvation is a free gift of God apart from our good works.
圣经教导：救恩是神无偿的礼物，而非靠我们的善行来赢取。
在福音之上附加律法条件与圣经的教导相违背。
- “For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.” (Romans 3:28)
- 所以(有古卷作“因为”)我们看定了：人称义是因着信，不在乎遵行律法。(罗马书 3:28)
- “For by grace are you saved, through faith – and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)
-你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信，这并不是出于自己，乃是　神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。(以弗所书 2:8-9)
Question: Is your faith (your believing) in Jesus something you do to be saved? Or, is it something God works in you so that you are saved? (John 6:29) It is “The work of God but the act of man.”
D. Misuse 8: Faulty Descriptions Of The Christian
误用8：错误地描述基督徒
1. Another common misuse of the law and gospel is to portray the Christian incorrectly. One error is to describe the Christian as an unconverted sinner who has only a sinful nature. A second error is to describe the Christian as a perfected saint who has only a believing nature. Still another error is to make sweeping generalizations that apply to some Christians, but not to all. Such errors confuse and trouble believers and can lead them to doubt or lose their salvation.
另一种常见的误用律法与福音的方式是错误地描述基督徒。其一是将基督徒描述成未曾转变（没有信仰）只有罪性的罪人。其二是将基督徒描述成全无罪性的完美的圣徒。还有就是以偏概全（将只适用于某些基督徒的情况扩大化普遍化）。诸如此类的误用会迷惑与困扰基督徒，使他们对信仰产生怀疑，失去救恩。
Comment: Christians have a sinful nature and the new nature. We need the law to keep us aware of our sinfulness so that we remain contrite. We need the gospel to keep us confident of our forgiveness so that we do not despair.
2. Some examples of faulty descriptions of the Christian as an unconverted sinner are:
某些误将基督徒描述成没有信仰的罪人的实例：
- “A Christian cannot resist temptation.”
“一个基督徒无法抗拒诱惑。”
Comment: See 1 Corinthians 10:12-13; Philippians 2:12-13
- “A Christian cannot be sure of going to heaven.
“一个基督徒不能确定自己是否会进天国。”
Comment: 1 John 5:13
- “A Christian is not able to truly love God.”
“一个基督徒无法真正地爱神。”
King David often speaks of his love for God in the psalms.
Comment: Our love for God is perfect in our new nature; it is in our sinful nature that our love for God is absent. We use our baptism to drown the sinful nature and to awaken the new self in us to love God more and more.
3. Some examples of faulty descriptions of the Christian as a perfected saint are:
某些误将基督徒描述成完美的圣徒的实例：
- “A Christian tells the truth at all times.”
“一个基督徒永远讲真话。”
- “A Christian never desires revenge.”
“一个基督徒绝不想去报复别人。”
- “A Christian never questions or doubts God’s Word.”
“一个基督徒绝不会对神的话语有任何疑问。”
Question: Why do we Christians have these problems with sin?
Question: When will these descriptions of the Christian be accurate description? (In heaven)
4. Some examples of sweeping generalizations made about all Christians are:
某些以偏概全的实例：
- “No one in this church listens carefully to the preaching of God’s Word.”
“这间教会里没有一个人专心听牧师传讲神的话语。”
- “True Christians always take time to welcome the visitors to our church.”
“真正的基督徒总是花时间邀请人们来我们教会。”
- “The members of this congregation are extremely lazy.”
“这个教会的成员极其懒惰。”
Comment: See Isaiah 55:10-11. Where the gospel is preached there are Christians who truly love the Lord and are devoted to serving him.
5. When people make false descriptions of Christians, they either fail to recognize that Christians have both a sinful and a believing nature, that Christians are both sinful and sanctified at the same time or they mistakenly ascribe the behaviors of some believers to all.
有人错误地描述基督徒，是因为没有认识到基督徒既有罪性也有信仰，基督徒有罪恶同时也靠着神得圣洁。有人错误地将某些基督徒的不良行为归咎于所有基督徒。
- “The sinful nature desires what is contrary to the spiritual, and the spiritual what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.” (Galatians 5:17)
- 因为情欲和圣灵相争，圣灵和情欲相争，这两个是彼此相敌，使你们不能作所愿意作的。(加拉太书 5:17)
E. Review The Lesson
本课回顾
Agree And Disagree Statements
判断题
Mark each statement A (agree) or D (disagree)
正确的划“V”，错误的划“X”
1. The teaching of universalism has little need for either the law or the gospel.
普救论只需要一点点律法或福音而已。
2. Since God loves all people and sent Jesus to die for the sins all people, surely He will
bring all people safely to heaven in the end.
神爱世上所有的人并差遣耶稣为世人的罪而死。所以毫无疑问，在末日来临之时，神会将所有的人安全地带入天堂。
3. Unbelievers do have some ability to cooperate with God in the matter of their coming to faith in Jesus Christ.
非基督徒具有一定的能力与神协作共事，一同建立在耶稣基督里的信心。
(Since the fall into sin, all people are born spiritually dead, blind and hostile to God. They do not have the natural ability to cooperate with God in their conversion. Unbelievers can choose to listen to God’s Word, but they do not have the ability to accept it as true. It takes the power of God the Holy Spirit to create spiritual life and faith in them.)
4. Synergism denies the Bible’s teaching of salvation by God’s grace when it insists that a person is saved by a combination of the redeeming work of Jesus Christ and that person’s own decision to believe in Jesus
我们是靠着神的恩典而得救赎。协作论否认圣经的这一教导，认为某人得救是靠耶稣基督的救赎与此人的决定（决定相信耶稣）两方面联合作用。
(The Bible teaches that God saves people all by Himself. By nature, every person is spiritually dead and is unable and unwilling to believe in Jesus as his/her Savior or to contribute anything to their salvation and conversion. It is God the Holy Spirit alone who works through God’s Word to create saving faith in a person’s heart.)
5. Synergism robs God of His glory as the One who saves people all by Himself.
协作论抹煞神的荣耀，否认惟有神救赎世人的真理。
6. If you add the law conditions to the gospel promise, you always end up with a law result.
如果你在福音的应许之上加入律法（的条件），你将得到律法的结果。
（注：律法的结果不能让人得救，得救是福音的结果。）
7. If a person tries to be saved by a combination of Christ’s works and his/her own works, he/she will not be saved at all.
如果一个人试图靠基督的救赎大业与自身的努力共同作用而得救赎，他/她便得不到救赎。
8. Our salvation depends about 99.99% on God and about .01% on us.
我们得救，大约百分之九十九点九九靠神，百分之零点零一靠我们自己。
9. Christians produce works pleasing to God, and they also commit sins displeasing to God every day of their lives.
在日常生活中，基督徒会做蒙神喜悦的事，他们同样会犯罪，不蒙神喜悦。
10. Speaking to Christians as if they were still unbelieving sinners or as if they were already perfected saints can cause them great spiritual harm.
把基督徒当作没有信仰的罪人或完美的圣徒看待，会给他们造成巨大的属灵伤害。
Evaluate The Following Teachings
你如何评价以下教导
1. “Every human soul will progress through the ages to heights that are sublime and glorious, where God is Love and Love is God.”
“每个人的灵魂会随着时间的推移不断成长，达到崇高荣耀的神爱合一的高度。”
2. “All who because of their faith in Jehovah God and in Christ Jesus dedicate themselves to do God’s will and then faithfully carry out their dedication will be rewarded with everlasting life.”
“凡相信耶和华神与基督耶稣，忠实执行神的旨意，甘心奉献的人，神必赐予他们永生作为奖赏。”
