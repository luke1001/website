Lesson 3: The Gospel: God’s Extremely Good News For Us
第三课 福音：神赐予我们的绝佳消息

A. The Great Truth Of The Gospel And Its Primary Meaning
福音的伟大真理及其根本意义
We begin with a definition of the word “gospel”
Submit
1. In His Word, God has revealed the two great truths of His law and gospel. The gospel is a truth that contains very good news for people. God’s gospel sends a specially beautiful, loving, generous and pleasing message to us.
神在他的话语中向我们们显明福音与律法两大真理。福音为人类带来充满神的爱与丰盛、无比美好、令人欢欣鼓舞的信息。
Submit
2. The word “gospel” is a combination of two old English words “good” and “spell” that mean “good news.”
“福音”是一个合成词，由古英语“好”和“消息”合二而一，义为“好消息”。
3. The primary word that is translated “gospel” in the Bible is the New Testament Greek word “euangelion.”
圣经中“福音”一词最初译自新约希腊语“euangelion”。“eu”义为“好”，“angelion”义为“信息”。
Submit
4. Most of the time, God uses the word “gospel” in a specific, primary sense to refer to “God’s loving work to save people from sins and give them eternal salvation and all its blessings through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ.”
多数情况下，神以“福音” 一词专指“神的爱，神拯救人于罪恶，赐予人类永恒的救恩，通过耶稣基督的救赎大业带给人祝福。”
5. When we speak about God’s teachings of law and gospel, we are using this specific, primary definition of the gospel.
当我们讲到关于神的律法与福音的教导时，我们就是在应用福音这一基本的、专门的定义。
ANY QUESTIONS?
B. The Revelation Of The Gospel
福音的启示
By “revelation” we are speaking of the fact that the gospel was hidden and had to be unveiled, made visible, so we can know (or: see) it.
Submit
God has revealed the good news of His saving love in Jesus Christ only in His Word.
神只在他的话语里显明耶稣基督救恩的好消息。
- “Now to Him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past, but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey Him.” (Romans 16:25-26)
惟有　神能照我所传的福音和所讲的耶稣基督，并照永古隐藏不言的奥秘，坚固你们的心。这奥秘如今显明出来，而且按着永生　神的命，藉众先知的书指示万国的民，使他们信服真道。(罗马书 16:25-26)
- “From infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.” (2 Timothy 3:15)
并且知道你是从小明白圣经；这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣，有得救的智慧。(提摩太后书 3:15)
The Bible – the Holy Scriptures – is where the gospel is revealed for us.
C. The Messages Of The Gospel
福音信息

In the gospel, God reveals His great giving and saving love for people.
在福音中，神显明他赐予人类救恩的大爱。
1. He tells them He loves them and desires their salvation.
神让人知道他的爱，希望他们得救。
- “The Lord appeared to us in the past saying: ‘I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness.’” (Jeremiah 31:3)
古时(或作“从远方”)耶和华向以色列(原文作“我”)显现，说：“我以永远的爱爱你，因此我以慈爱吸引你。(耶利米书 31:3)
- “This is good and pleases God our Savior who wants all men (mankind; people) to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.” (1 Timothy 2:3-4)
这是好的，在　神我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。他愿意万人得救，明白真道。(提摩太前书 2:3-4)
God loves us from eternity and God wants us to be saved. He wants ALL people to be saved.
Submit
2. He announces that His love has moved Him to send His Son Jesus Christ to save people and give them eternal life.
神宣告，因着爱，他差遣他的儿子耶稣基督救赎人类并赐给他们永生。

神差他独生子到世间来，使我们藉着他得生，　神爱我们的心在此就显明了。(约翰壹书 4:9)
We also think of John 3:16.
Submit
3. He declares that Jesus Christ has done everything that He requires and has paid everything that sinners owe to save all people.
神宣告，耶稣基督已成就神所要求的一切，替罪人偿还了一切债务，拯救人类。
- “But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself. (Hebrews 9:26)
但如今在这末世显现一次，把自己献为祭，好除掉罪。(希伯来书 9:26)
- “By that will we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” (Hebrews 10:10)
我们凭这旨意，靠耶稣基督只一次献上他的身体，就得以成圣。(希伯来书 10:10)

Submit
4. He assures people that He forgives all their sins because of what Jesus Christ has done for them.
神让人确信，他已因着耶稣基督为人类所成就的一切而宽恕了他们所有的罪。
- In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding. (Ephesians 1:7)
我们藉这爱子的血，得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照他丰富的恩典。这恩典是　神用诸般智慧聪明，充充足足赏给我们的(以弗所书 1:7-8)
- “The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, purifies us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7b)
他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。(约翰壹书 1:7b)
Salvation is found IN Jesus; outside of us.
Notice “purifies” is in the present tense. The blood of Jesus purified us when he offered his life as the sacrifice for our sins 2000 years ago; but the gospel is the message which purifies us because it brings the cleansing power of that blood to us wherever we live and in the time when we live.
ILLUSTRATION: A WATER PIPE BRINGS WATER TO MY HOUSE FROM THE WATER TOWER WHICH IS FAR AWAY

The Lord [LORD] is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. . . . He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.” (Psalm 103:2b-5a, 8, 10)
我的心哪！你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。他赦免你的一切罪孽，医治你的一切疾病。他救赎你的命脱离死亡，以仁爱和慈悲为你的冠冕。他用美物，使你所愿的得以知足. . . . 耶和华有怜悯，有恩典，不轻易发怒，且有丰盛的慈爱. . . . 他没有按我们的罪过待我们，也没有照我们的罪孽报应我们。(诗篇103:2b-5a, 8, 10)

God uses a variety of forms to deliver the true, love-filled message of the gospel:
神以多种方式传达真实的、充满爱的福音信息。
Submit
1. God makes announcements.
神发布通告。
- “But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you, He is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10-11)
那天使对他们说：“不要惧怕！我报给你们大喜的信息，是关乎万民的；因今天在大卫的城里，为你们生了救主，就是主基督。(路加福音 2:10-11)
WHAT WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT?
Submit
2. God makes promises.
神承诺。

神广发邀请。
- “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)
凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。(马太福音 11:28)
What does Jesus invite you to receive from him? What does this rest have to do with? (spiritual rest)
Submit
4. God makes urgent pleas.
神迫切恳求。
- “Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!” (Ezekiel 18:31b-32)
以色列家啊！你们何必死亡呢？主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。”(以西结书 18:31b-32)
Why is the call of the gospel an urgent call? (time of grace is limited) 2 Corinthians 6:2
Submit
5. God speaks comforting messages
神讲宽慰人的信息。
- “Comfort, comfort, my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.” (Isaiah 40:1-2)
你们的　神说：“你们要安慰，安慰我的百姓。要对耶路撒冷说安慰的话，又向他宣告说，他争战的日子已满了，他的罪孽赦免了，他为自己的一切罪，从耶和华手中加倍受罚。” (以赛亚书 40:1-2)
What is the message that comforts sinners? (comfort = lit., let her breathe again!)
Submit
6. God offers encouragements.
神鼓舞激励人。
- Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews 12:2-3)
仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣(或作“仰望那将真道创始成终的耶稣”)，他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在　神宝座的右边。那忍受罪人这样顶撞的，你们要思想，免得疲倦灰心。(希伯来书 12:2-3)
Notice that God encourages us through one another. Hebrews 10:25 is another example of the encouragement we provide to each other when we speak with gospel encouragement to each other.
E. The Purposes Of The Gospel
福音的目的
As a gift of His lavish love, God has given the gospel for a number of important reasons:
作为爱的礼物，神赐给人类福音有以下重要理由：
Submit
1. God gives the gospel to bring people to saving faith in Jesus Christ.
神的福音使人信靠耶稣基督。
- “If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. . . Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.” (Romans 10:9, 17)
你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信　神叫他从死里复活，就必得救. . . 可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。(罗马书 10:9, 17)
Question: According to the second passage, how does God give us faith? (By hearing the message)
Question: What is the gospel called that passage? (the word of Christ)
God works through law and gospel but only through the gospel does he create faith.
Commentary on the first passage:
The “if” is a descriptive “if” which is followed by a pair of descriptions of Christians: they confess Jesus with their words because they believe in Jesus with their hearts.
This faith, which produces a confession of Christ to the world, is the result of hearing God’s word, the gospel. So Jesus says in the Gospels and in Revelation 2 & 3 – “Whoever has an ear, let him hear.” and “Let him who has ears, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
Submit
2. God gives the gospel to make contrite sinners confident of salvation and eternal life.
神的福音使悔过的罪人对救恩与永生充满信心。
- “God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13b-14a)
因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。神藉我们所传的福音召你们到这地步。(帖撒罗尼迦后书 2:13b-14a)
- “And this is the testimony that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.” (1 John 5:11-13)
这见证就是　神赐给我们永生，这永生也是在他儿子里面。人有了　神的儿子就有生命；没有　神的儿子就没有生命。我将这些话写给你们信奉　神儿子之名的人，要叫你们知道自己有永生。(约翰壹书 5:11-13)
Question: Does God want you to be sure that you have eternal life?
Question: Where in the second passage (1 John 5:13) does it says that God wants you to sure that he has forgiven your sins? (“that you may know that you have eternal life”)
Question: Who can be sure of this? (all who believe in the Son of God)

Or: commentary:
Notice what John says in the second of these two verses: that you may KNOW that you have eternal life. Every believer – the one who looks to Jesus for forgiveness – can be certain that he/she has eternal life.
Submit
3. God gives the gospel to give Christians the spiritual desire and strength to live a life of obedience to His law.
神的福音使基督徒有意志力，渴望过遵从神的律法的生活。
- “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” (Galatians 2:20)
我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的，不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信　神的儿子而活，他是爱我，为我舍己。(加拉太书 2:20)
- “It is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.” (Philippians 2:13)
因为你们立志行事，都是　神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。(腓力比书2:13)
- “We love because He first loved us.” (1 John 4:19)
我们爱，因为　神先爱我们。(约翰壹书 4:19)
Question: How did Jesus show that he loves us?
Question: What does it mean to “love” as stated in that last passage? (effectively, it means to obey the commandments; to live a holy life. “If you love me, you will keep my commands” says Jesus.)
OR: COMMENTARY
To “love” is to obey the commandments. Jesus says, “if you love me, you will keep my commands.”
F. Sinful Efforts To Interfere With God’s Purposes In The Gospel
人类的罪恶努力抵挡神实现福音的目的
Submit
1. All people, by nature, are spiritually dead to God and are unable to understand and accept the gospel and are opposed to it.
因着本性，人类天生与神隔绝——灵里的死亡。他们无法理解与接受福音，反而背离福音。
- “As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins.” (Ephesians 2:1)
你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。(以弗所书 2:1)
- “The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (1 Corinthians 2:14)
然而，属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道；因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。(哥林多前书 2:14)
- “For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.” (Philippians 3:18)
因为有许多人行事是基督十字架的仇敌。我屡次告诉你们，现在又流泪地告诉你们；(腓力比书 3:18)
Questions: Can you give an example of something the Bible teaches which the unbeliever thinks is foolishness? (that the death of One Person can remove all sins; that the dead can rise; that Jesus is God)
Give an example of how people demonstrate that they are enemies of the cross of Christ. (Ridicule or mock Christians who trust in the cross of Jesus.)
Do you and I who believe in Jesus still have this sinful, oppositional attitude in us? (yes, in the sinful nature)
COMMENTARY:
Consciously or unconsciously, sinners oppose the gospel in their sinful nature.
Submit
2. In their opposition to God and His gospel, the sinful natures of people lead them to oppose the gospel in such ways as:
人的罪性（罪恶天性）使人在以下方面背离福音：
a. Rejecting the gospel as an unimpressive, repulsive and foolish message.
拒绝福音，把福音当作无聊、愚昧、令人厌烦的信息。
- “Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.” (1 Corinthians 1:22-23)
犹太人是要神迹，希腊人是求智慧；我们却是传钉十字架的基督，在犹太人为绊脚石，在外邦人为愚拙；(哥林多前书 1:22-23)
QUESTION: In the place where you live, do people generally look for signs (miracles) or for wisdom (what makes logical sense)
COMMENTARY
The sinful nature in people (us included) thinks that it is foolish to say that someone can or must die for me to save me from my sins.
Submit
b. Adding law conditions to the gospel.
给福音附加律法条件。
- “Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of the world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch! These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.” (Colossians 2:20-22)
你们若是与基督同死，脱离了世上的小学，为什么仍象在世俗中活着，服从那“不可拿、不可尝、不可摸”等类的规条呢？这都是照人所吩咐、所教导的。说到这一切，正用的时候就都败坏了。(歌罗西书 2:20-22)
COMMENTARY
The gospel is all grace. It must not be presented conditionally. You should not tell someone “all you need to do is believe” because that statement will be understood legalistically by the sinful nature. It suggests that faith is something we do to earn salvation – to do our part.
Rather we need to present the fact that salvation is done! This message produces the faith needed to receive the salvation it proclaims. See Romans 1:17 – KJV: “from faith; to faith.” Colossians 2;12 – Your faith “of the power of God” = your faith worked by the power of God.
See Ephesians 2:8,9
QUESTION: Are there ways by which people make the gospel conditional?
Submit
c. Rejecting and attacking the Bible’s teaching about the person and work of Jesus Christ.
拒绝、攻击圣经中关于耶稣生平事迹的教导。
- “They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them – bringing swift destruction on themselves.” (2 Peter 2:1b)
自引进陷害人的异端，连买他们的主他们也不承认，自取速速的灭亡。(彼得后书 2:1b)
- “Every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.” (1 John 4:3)
凡灵不认耶稣，就不是出于　神，这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来，现在已经在世上了。(约翰一书 4:3)
Question: How do people attack the truth about Jesus (who he is) where you live? (Just a great teacher; a pacifist; a women’s liberator; a revolutionary)
COMMENTARY
If Jesus is not true God and true man, then his work for us is not sufficient.
Submit
d. Inventing and promoting false gospels.
自行发明与推销伪福音。
- “I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel – which is really no gospel at all.” (Galatians 1:6-7a)
我希奇你们这么快离开那藉着基督之恩召你们的，去从别的福音–那并不是福音，(加拉太书 1:6-7a)
Question: What is an example (or more) of people producing false “gospels”? (Joseph Smith [Mormonism] Mohammed [Islam] Buddha [Buddhism]) {Answer given 2/28/11: an example of a father in law who said Jesus Christ is a foreigner; you can’t trust him because he is a foreign teacher; his teaching is no longer effective; he is a low class.}
COMMENTARY
Notice how every other “gospel” is not gospel at all because these religions and every other religion of the world teaches salvation by works.
Submit
e. Asserting that the gospel is divine permission to continue in sin.
把福音当作继续犯罪的神圣许可证。
- “They are godless men who change the grace of God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.” (Jude 4)
因为有些人偷着进来，将我们　神的恩变作放纵情欲的机会，并且不认独一的主宰我们(“我们”或作“和我们”)主耶稣基督。
Question: Are there any cults which have turned Christianity into a religion of sexual sinning or other wickedness?
(Jim Jones – was the founder and leader of the Peoples Temple, which is best known for the November 18, 1978 mass murder of more than 900 Temple members in Jonestown, Guyana along with the killings of five other people at a nearby airstrip; Charles Manson; David Koresh; Sun Myung Moon (born February 25, 1920) is the Korean founder and leader of the Worldwide Unification Church.)
COMMENTARY
See Romans 5:20-6:2
