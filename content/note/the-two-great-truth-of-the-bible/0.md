Lesson 1: The Primary Parts of The Law And The Gospel
第一课 律法与福音的主要内容

A. The True God Speaks To Us In His Word, The Bible
圣经：真神向我们讲述他的道
1. Out of His great love for us, God has spoken to us and revealed the things that are essential for us to know about Him and His will so that we can have a close, loving relationship with Him. The Bible is God’s Spirit-given, absolutely true, and dynamically powerful word.
In His Word, God is introducing Himself to us so that we can know Him and have a personal relationship with Him. The Holy Bible is the powerful and saving Word of God. God’s Holy Spirit is at work in it. The book of Hebrews [4:12] says the Word of God is living and active. Jesus says [John 6:63] that His word is spirit and it is truth. Paul calls it the Power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes [Romans 1:16].
因着对我们的大爱，神以话语来启示我们，他显明万事让我们从中认识他，明了他的旨意，从而更亲近他。圣经是神赐给我们的属灵礼物，是永生神的权威话语，是绝对真理。

- “No mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him, but God has revealed it to us by His Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 2:9b-10)
Unless the LORD had revealed His Word to us in the Bible, we would never have been able to imagine or know what God has lovingly provided for us through His Son, Jesus the Christ.
“神为爱他的人所预备的，是人心未曾想到的。只有　神藉著圣灵向我们显明了。”（哥林多前书2:9b-10）

- “All Scripture is God-breathed.” (2 Timothy 3:16a)
Because of this passage and others like it, we say that the Bible is “verbally inspired.” This means that God has miraculously given us each word [in the Greek and Hebrew texts]. These words (or thoughts of God; also called the mind of Christ) have been translated into our languages so that the message, the meaning, can reach our minds and hearts.
“圣经都是神所默示的。”（提摩太后书3:16a）

- “Your Word is truth.” (John 17:17b)
Because the Bible is God’s Word, and God cannot lie, we know that the Bible is without error. Nothing is missing (We don’t need to add anything to it); nothing is wrong (we don’t need to change anything or correct anything).
“你的道就是真理。”（约翰福音17:17b）

- “The word of God is living and active. Sharper than any two-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow, it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”（Hebrews 4:12）
Oftentimes in the Old Testament (Isaiah 42; Psalm 2; Psalm 110 and in Revelation the Son of God is pictured as having a sharp sword coming out of his mouth. This sword is the Word of God which cuts in two ways – with two “sharp” or distinct and different messages. We call these messages Law and Gospel.
QUESTIONS?
神的道是活泼的，是有功效的，比一切两刃的剑更快，甚至魂与灵、骨节与骨髓，都能刺入、剖开，连心中的思念和主意都能辨明。(希伯来书4:12)

2. God’s Word is effective in accomplishing the important things God wants it to do in our hearts and lives.
神的话语卓有成效地在我们的生命与心中成就大事。
- “So is My word that goes out from My mouth: It will not return to Me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.” (Isaiah 55:11)
This is a comforting truth for us to remember. Whenever we use God’s Word for ourselves or for others, we can be sure that it will achieve the purpose for which God has given it to us. The next passage speaks of its most important purpose in the first sentence.
“我口所出的话也必如此，决不徒然返回，却要成就我所喜悦的，在我发它去成就的事上必然亨通。”（以赛亚书55:11）

- “You have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:15-17)
According to the first sentence (the first half) of this passage, we see that the primary purpose of the Scriptures is to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. This is the work of the Gospel. God’s word is also useful for the things mentioned in the second sentence. These other things are the work of the Law.
“并且知道你是从小明白圣经；这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧。圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，”（提摩太后书3:15-17）

3. God reveals his primary will for people in His two great truths, the two major teaching of the Bible: the law and the gospel.
神在两大真理中向人显明他的根本旨意。圣经的主要教导——律法与福音。

- “For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king” (Isaiah 33:22a)
This passage reminds us that God the LORD writes the rules. He makes the laws by which we are to live our life. He has given us life and he has written the user’s manual.
“因为耶和华是审判我们的，耶和华是给我们设律法的，耶和华是我们的王。”（以赛亚书33: 22a）

- “I am the Lord your God. Follow My decrees and be careful to obey My laws, and you will live safely in the land.” (Leviticus 25:17-18)
There are a 1,001 ways to do things wrong. But only one way to do them right. God’s way. There are a million directions you can take in order to get lost on a journey, but only one direction you must take to get to the place you want to go. People who try to establish a family without God’s guidance, will inevitably make mistakes. If we would keep the law, we would be safe and blessed. The fact is, we don’t keep God’s law.
“因为我是耶和华你们的　神。我的律例，你们要遵行，我的典章，你们要谨守，就可以在那地上安然居住。”(利未记 25:17-18)

- “For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” (Romans 1:17)
This passage refers to the other message from God. Paul calls it the gospel. The “good news.” This happy message brings hope to sinners. Sure hope. For the salvation it brings belongs to anyone who believes. And believing is also God’s gift to us, as we will see from other scriptures.
“因为　神的义正在这福音上显明出来；这义是本于信，以至于信。如经上所记：‘义人必因信得生。’”（罗马书 1:17）

4. God wants people to hold to and proclaim His Word (including its teachings of law and gospel) faithfully and correctly as they apply it to their lives and the lives of others.
神要我们在个人与他人的实际生活应用中，正确、忠实地掌握与宣扬他的道（包括律法与福音的教导）。

- “He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.” (Titus 1:9) The distinction between law and gospel is the most important thing a pastor, preacher, teacher needs to be able to make, to be apt to teach God’s Word.
“坚守所教真实的道理，就能将纯正的教训劝化人，又能把争辩的人驳倒了。”（提多书1:9）

- “Let the one who has My word speak it faithfully.” (Jeremiah 23:28b)
“得我话的人，可以诚实讲说我的话。”（耶利米书23:28b）

- “Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.” (2 Timothy 2:15) To correctly handle the word of truth includes using the law to expose sin and using the gospel to remove sin; using the law to work contrition and repentance; using the gospel to remove fear and restore life to the dead. QUESTIONS?
“你当竭力在　神面前得蒙喜悦，作无愧的工人，按著正意分解真理的道。”（提摩太后书2:15）
