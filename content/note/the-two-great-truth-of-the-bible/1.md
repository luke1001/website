Lesson 2： The Law: God’s Extremely Hard News For Us
The Two Great Truths Of The Bible
圣经的两大真理
——律法与福音——
Lesson 2: The Law: God’s Extremely Hard News For Us
第二课 律法：来自神的严酷消息
A. The Great Truth Of The Law And Its Primary Meaning
律法的伟大真理与基本意义
1. In His Word, God has revealed the two great truths of His Law and Gospel. The law is a truth that contains very hard news for us to receive. God’s law sends an exceedingly strong, stern, demanding and difficult message to us.
Questions? Thoughts?
神在他的话语中向我们显明律法与福音两大真理。律法承载着极为严酷的消息，是来自神的强烈、严厉、苛求、难以遵循的信息。
2. The two primary words that are translated “law” in the Bible are the Old Testament Hebrew word, “torah”, and the New Testament Greek word, “nomos.”
[Sometimes “torah” can refer to the Gospel or to Law and Gospel; literally it means “teaching.”] Thoughts? Questions?
“律法”一词有两个最初的译法，一个是旧约中的希伯来语“教导”，一个是新约中的希腊语“法律”。
3. Most of the time, God uses the word “law” in the Bible in a specific, primary sense to refer to “God’s holy, moral demands of all people that they be perfect and God’s condemnation and punishments for those who disobey Him.”
多数情况下，神在圣经中以“律法” 一词专指“神的圣洁，神对人类完美的道德要求，神对悖逆者的定罪与惩罚。”
- “Be holy because I am the Lord your God. Keep My decrees and follow them.” (Leviticus 20:7b-8a)
所以你们要自洁成圣，因为我是耶和华你们的　神。你们要谨守遵行我的律例，我是叫你们成圣的耶和华。（利未记20:7b-8a）
- “The soul who sins is the one who will die.” (Ezekiel 18:4b)
犯罪的他必死亡。（以西结书18:4b）
What does God demand of us in His Law? (that we be perfect; holy)
What does God declare as the punishment for those who are not holy or perfect? (death)
4. When we speak about God’s teachings of the law and gospel, we are using this specific, primary definition/sense of the law.
当我们讲到关于神的律法与福音的教导时，我们就是在应用律法这一基本的、专门的定义。
B. The Revelation Of The Law
律法的启示
God has revealed His law to people in two places:
神在两个地方向人类启示他的律法：
Submit
1. God has written His holy, moral demands on the minds and souls of people at the time of their creation.
This is sometimes called “natural law” because it is something all people have by nature.
神早在创世之初就已将他的圣洁、他的道德要求书写在人类的头脑与心灵里。
- “They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.” (Romans 2:15)
What is the Chinese word for “conscience”? What is the conscience? What does it do?
这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里，他们是非之心同作见证，并且他们的思念互相较量，或以为是，或以为非。（罗马书2:15）
Submit
2. The entrance of sin into people’s lives has blurred this once perfect knowledge of the law. So now, when people are created, they have a limited and flawed understanding of God’s requirements of them.
This is something like getting into your car on a rainy day and not turning on the windshield wipers. You can see large things, like a truck, but you could easily miss the child walking in front of your car.
罪恶进入人类生活，玷污了这一曾经完美的、对神律法的认知。如今，人类在这方面的知识已相当有限且残缺不全。
Submit
3. In order to help people know His moral demands of them clearly and fully, God lovingly revealed His law in a second way. He had it written and recorded in various places in the Bible.
This takes the “fog” – or the non-clarity out of our thinking when it comes to right and wrong.
为了使人充分清楚地了解神对人的道德要求，神充满慈爱地以第二种方式向我们显明他的律法——将律法书写记录在圣经的诸多地方。
- “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of His law.” (Deuteronomy 29:29)
He has not told us everything, but everything he has told us is all that we need to know about right and wrong. (2 Timothy 3:16 & 17)
隐秘的事是属耶和华我们　神的；惟有明显的事是永远属我们和我们子孙的，好叫我们遵行这律法上的一切话。”（申命记29:29）
C. The Messages Of The Law
律法的信息
Submit
In the law, God makes great and important demands of people:
神在律法中向人类提出重大要求：
1. God commands people to love Him and all other people with their whole being at all times.
神命令人毕生全身心地爱神、爱所有的人。
- “Jesus replied, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind . . . and love your neighbor as yourself.’” (Matthew 22:37, 39b)
This is a huge demand of us, because at no time are we to relax or rest from this duty. All the time, with all that we are and have, we are to love the Lord.
耶稣对他说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽意，爱主你的　神… 要爱人如己。”(马太福音22:37, 39b)
Submit
2. God instructs people to carry out this command to love in many different ways:
神教导人在诸多方面执行这一爱的指令。
- “You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself an idol. You shall not bow down to worship them. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Honor your father and your mother. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife . . . or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
(Exodus 20:3-17 some of this is ceremonial laws – e.g., the Sabbath Law) (The 10 Commandments are also in Deuteronomy 5:6-21; see Deuteronomy 10:4 which tells us that when we count them, we need to find 10 commandments; not 11 or 9 or 12…)
(See also Leviticus 19 (civil laws are included here) and Romans 12:9-13:1)
除了我以外，你不可有别的神。不可为自己雕刻偶像；不可跪拜那些像；不可妄称耶和华你　神的名；当记念安息日，守为圣日。当孝敬父母。不可杀人。不可奸淫。不可偷盗。不可作假见证陷害人。不可贪恋人的妻子. . . 并他一切所有的。（出埃及记20:3-17）（另见利未记 19及罗马书 12:9-13:1）
Submit
3. God requires that people keep his law perfectly (100%) in all that they are and think and say and do.
神要求人的一切思想言行都完美无缺（100%）地符合他的律法。
- “Be holy, because I the Lord your God, am holy.” (Leviticus 19:2)
“你们要圣洁，因为我耶和华你们的　神是圣洁的。”（利未记 19:2）
- “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Matthew 5:48)
所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。（马太福音5:48）
Submit
4. God will not change or alter any part of His law’s demands and punishments.
神不会更改他律法中的任何诫命及惩罚。
- “I the Lord do not change.” (Malachi 3:6)
“因我耶和华是不改变的。”（马拉基书3:6）
Submit
5. In the law, God promises blessing for those who perfectly obey it and curses for those who disobey it.
神在律法中应许：完全遵行律法的人将得祝福，违背律法的人将遭诅咒。
- “He answered, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and, Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ‘You have answered correctly,’ Jesus replied, ‘Do this and you will live.’” (Luke 10:27-28)
What does Jesus promise to those who obey God’s Law to love God first and to love your neighbor as you love yourself? (life)
他回答说：“你要尽心、尽性、尽力、尽意爱主你的　神；又要爱邻舍如同自己。”耶稣说：“你回答的是。你这样行，就必得永生。”（路加福音10:27-28）
Submit
- “All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” (Galatians 3:10)
What does it mean to be under a curse? (To be subject to suffering harm.) What is the worst curse a person can be under? (death)
凡以行律法为本的，都是被咒诅的，因为经上记著：“凡不常照律法书上所记一切之事去行的，就被咒诅。”（加拉太书3:10）
Submit
6. In the law, God declares the just and convicting truth that all people have failed to keep His law and have sinned.
神在律法中宣告公正确凿的事实——世人犯了罪，未能遵守神的律法。
- “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one . . . All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:10-12, 23)
How many people have sinned and are sinners? (All) Any exceptions to this rule? (only Jesus)
就如经上所记：“没有义人，连一个也没有！没有明白的，没有寻求　神的. . . 都是偏离正路，一同变为无用。没有行善的，连一个也没有！”. . .因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了　神的荣耀。（罗马书3:10-12, 23）
Submit
7. In the law, God delivers the just and terrifying truth that all sinners are under His just condemnation and must suffer His earthly and eternal wrath and punishment.
神在律法中传达了公正可怕的事实——所有罪人都在神公义的审判之下，必将承受神现世与永恒的烈怒和惩罚。
- “But your iniquities have separated you from your God. Your sins have hidden His face from you. (Isaiah 59:2)
What is the punishment people suffer for their sins according to this verse? (They are separated from God so that he does not hear them when they pray.)
但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝，你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。(以赛亚书 59:2)
Submit
- “The wages of sin is death.” (Romans 6:23)
What is the punishment sinners deserve according to this passage? (Death; this means separation from God’s good blessings in this life and in the life to come.)
罪的工价乃是死。(罗马书 6:23)
Submit
- “Then Jesus said to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matthew 25:41)
What is the punishment sinners deserve according to this passage? (eternal fire; hell; separation from God’s spiritual and physical blessings for all eternity)
王又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所豫备的永火里去。(马太福音25:41)
D. The Forms Of The Law
律法的形式
Submit
God uses a variety of forms to deliver the true, powerful messages of His law:
神以多种方式传达真实、权威的律法信息。
1. God gives commands or orders.
神发布命令。
- “The Lord your God commands you this day to follow these decrees and laws; carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul. (Deuteronomy 26:16)

Submit
2. God makes demands or authoritative claims.
神提出要求。
- “He said to them, ‘Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” (Matthew 22:21)
(What is the command in this statement? (Pay what you owe – in taxes; in support for the kingdom of God)
耶稣说，这样，该撒的物当归给该撒，神的物当归给神。(马太福音22:21)
Submit
3. God issues warnings.
神发出警告。
- “Know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.” (Ecclesiastes 11:9)
却要知道，为这一切的事，神必审问你。(传道书11:9)
- “Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.” (Ezekiel 18:30b)

4. God makes threats.
神发出威吓
- “Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out.” (Deuteronomy 27:26)
God threatens with a curse.

5. God makes valid accusations of sin and wrongdoing.
神指控罪与恶行。
- “Hear the word of the Lord, you Israelites, because the Lord has a charge to bring against you who live in the land: ‘There is no faithfulness, no love, no acknowledgement of God in the land. There is only cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery; they break all bounds, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.” (Hosea 4:1-2)
God makes these accusations according to the truth so as to alert people to sin they may be overlooking.
以色列人哪，你们当听耶和华的话。耶和华与这地的居民争辩，因这地上无诚实，无良善，无人认识神。但起假誓，不践前言，杀害，偷盗，奸淫，行强暴，杀人流血，接连不断。 (何西阿书4:1-2)
Submit
6. God makes just condemnations of sin and unbelief.
神对罪与悖逆发出公义的责难。
- “Their sin engulfs them; they are always before Me . . . He does not return to the Lord his God or search for Him. . . Woe to them, because they have strayed from Me! Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against Me! (Hosea 7:2b, 10b, 13a)
What does the word “woe” refer to? (trouble that is coming to the sinner because of his/her sin.)
他们所行的现在缠绕他们，都在我面前。。。他们仍不归向耶和华他们的神，也不寻求他。。。他们因离弃我，必定有祸，因违背我，必被毁灭。(何西阿书7:2b, 10b, 13a)
Submit
7. God pronounces punishments for sin.
神宣告罪得惩罚。
- “On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide My face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?’ And I will certainly hide My face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.” (Deuteronomy 31:17-18)
The LORD speaks of many sorts of punishments that come to the sinner. Disasters; difficulties; God’s face hidden from his people.
那时，我的怒气必向他们发作。我也必离弃他们，掩面不顾他们，以致他们被吞灭，并有许多的祸患灾难临到他们。那日他们必说，这些祸患临到我们，岂不是因我们的神不在我们中间吗？那时，因他们偏向别神所行的一切恶，我必定掩面不顾他们。 (申命记31:17-18)
Submit
8. God promises rewards for complete obedience.
神应许完全的顺服得奖赏。
- “If you fully obey the Lord your God and carefully follow all His commands I give you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations on the earth. All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the Lord your God.” (Deuteronomy 28:1-2)
God promises social dominance; many other blessings to those who fully obey him.
一切诫命，就是我今日所吩咐你的，他必使你超乎天下万民之上。你若听从耶和华你神的话，这以下的福必追随你，临到你身上，(申命记28:1-2)
E. The Purposes Of The Law
神律法的目的
Submit
Out of His great love, God has given people His law for a number of important reasons:
神爱世人且为人设立律法，有以下几个重要理由。
1. Originally, God gave the law as a means by which people could gain salvation for themselves. They could earn salvation by perfectly obeying the law. (The Law as a Stairway to heaven)
For a brief while, Adam and Eve were able to keep the Law and by keeping it would have progressed toward being confirmed in bliss as are the holy angels today. But they did not retain their first estate. (compare Jude 6 and Matthew 18:10) QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
律法原本是神为那些能够靠着完美无缺地遵行律法而为自己赢得救恩的人设立的。（律法如同通往神国的天梯）
- Keep My decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the Lord.” (Leviticus 18:5)
所以，你们要守我的律例典章，人若遵行，就必因此活着。我是耶和华。(利未记18:5)
Submit
2. Since the Fall into sin and the spiritual corruption of the human race, all people are sinful and fail to keep the law perfectly. Now no one is able to save himself/herself by obeying the law. (The Law is a Dead End as a means of salvation)
由于人类陷入罪及灵魂的堕落，没有人能完美无缺地遵行律法，没有人可以靠着顺从律法而自救/得救。（靠律法得救赎是一条死胡同）
- “All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.” (Psalm 14:3)
他们都偏离正路，一同变为污秽。并没有行善的，连一个也没有。(诗篇14:3)
- “Therefore no one will be declared righteous in His sight by observing the law.” (Romans 3:20a)
所以凡有血气的没有一个，因行律法，能在神面前称义。(罗马书3:20a)
We are unable to obey the Law from the get-go; from conception forward. The sinful nature is a ruined human nature. People by nature “not only lack fear and trust in (the true) God, but also do not even have the power or gifts to produce fear and trust in (the true) God.” {Apology to the Augsburg Confession, II (I) 3} See also Genesis 6:5; Psalm 51:5; Isaiah 64:6.
Submit
3. God now uses the law for the primary purpose of causing people to realize and be genuinely sorry for their sins and to be afraid of God and His judgment on their sins. The name we give to this spiritual condition is contrition. (The Law as a Photograph that reveals our sin and punishment)
Photograph: This is the FIRST of three uses that the law has.
We can also use the idea of an “X-ray” or “Cat Scan” or “MRI” – able to reveal the broken bone; the tumor; the aneurism; but not able to remedy the problem. As a “photograph” the law is only able to make the patient scared because of the disease revealed through the medical test.
神律法的根本目的是令人认罪悔过，敬畏神、惧怕神对罪的公义审判。我们将这一属灵状况称为悔悟。（律法如同一帧照片显明我们的罪与神的惩罚）
Submit
a. The law makes people aware of their sin and guilt.
律法使人知罪。
- “I would not have known what sin was except through the law.” (Romans 7:7b)
Paul speaks here of the sin of coveting. Unless the Law had been revealed to us in the Bible, we would not have known for sure that evil thoughts are damnable sins.
只是非因律法，我就不知何为罪。 (罗马书7:7b)
“Through the law we come conscious of sin.” (Romans 3:20b)
因为律法本是叫人知罪。(罗马书3:20b)
You can be sleeping and not aware of dangers around you – a bear comes into your tent when you are camping in the woods – but if you were to awaken, you would see the great danger you are in. The Law awakens us to the danger of our sins; makes us “conscious [aware] of sin”.
Submit
b. The law works in people a spirit of sincere regret for their sins.
律法令人在灵魂深处真诚悔过。
Regret – sadness – wish I could do it over again, but realizing that that is not possible and therefore sadness is overwhelming and the consequence earned frightening.
- “I confess my iniquity. I am troubled by me sin.” (Psalm 38:18)
我要承认我的罪孽。我要因我的罪忧愁。(诗篇38:18)
- “Father, I have sinned against Heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.” (Luke 15:21)
父亲，我得罪了天，又得罪了你，从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子。(路加福音 15:21)
Submit
c. The law crushes the sinful pride of people and kills their false hopes of avoiding or escaping God’s condemnation of their sins.
律法击碎人类的傲慢，无人能够侥幸回避与逃脱神对罪的审断。
- “My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. . . I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.” (Psalm 38:4, 8)
我的罪孽高过我的头，如同重担叫我担当不起。。。我被压伤，身体疲倦。因心里不安，我就唉哼。(诗篇38:4, 8)
- “Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandments come, sin sprang to life and I died.” (Romans 7:9)
我以前没有律法是活着的，但是诫命来到，罪又活了，我就死了。(罗马书7:9)
Until the law spoke its clear message, I could deceive myself into thinking that I wasn’t all that bad a person – or that the LORD’s view of right and wrong may have changed with society’s view of morality. But the Law won’t let me get away with that sort of thinking. It reveals God’s unchanging will – we call this the moral law.
Submit
d. The law leads people to despair of saving themselves and to be prepared to look to God to save them.
律法让人意识到自救无望，转而指望神的拯救。- “Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord; O Lord, hear my voice. Let Your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.” (Psalm 130:1-2)
耶和华啊，我从深处向你求告。主啊，求你听我的声音。愿你侧耳听我恳求的声音。 (诗篇130:1-2)
- “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?” (Romans 7:24)
我真是苦啊，谁能救我脱离这取死的身体呢。 (罗马书7:24)
- “I said, ‘O Lord, have mercy on me; heal me, for I have sinned against You.” (Psalm 41:4)
我曾说，耶和华啊，求你怜恤我，医治我。因为我得罪了你。(诗篇41:4)
This is the beneficial effect of the Law; it shows us our sins so that we are aware of our need for a Savior from sin. Those who are healthy do not need a doctor. Those who are sick need a doctor. The law makes it clear that we are spiritually sick.
Submit
4. By giving people the law to work contrition in their hearts, God uses the law in the service of the Gospel. People who are properly alarmed by their sin and afraid of God’s judgment are prepared to receive and appreciate the saving comfort God gives in the Gospel. People who are secure in their sin and not afraid of God’s judgment feel no need and have no interest in the Gospel.
凭借律法在人内心所做的认罪悔改的工作，神将律法应用于福音事工。凡被罪警醒，畏惧神公义审判的人，即得着福音救赎信息的安慰，并为此而感恩。凡心安理得沉溺于自己的罪，不惧怕神公义审判的人，不会在乎也不认为自己需要福音信息。
- “Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For, if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.” (Galatians 3:21-24)
这样，律法是与神的应许反对么。断乎不是。若曾传一个能叫人得生命的律法，义就诚然本乎律法了。但圣经把众人都圈在罪里，使所应许的福因信耶稣基督，归给那信的人。但这因信得救的理，还未来以先，我们被看守在律法之下，直圈到那将来的真道显明出来。这样律法是我们训蒙的师傅，引我们到基督那里，使我们因信称义。(加拉太书3:21-24)

5. God also uses the law to restrict the sinful behavior of people so that there is relative peace and order in the world. (The law as a Fence to restrain sin)
神用律法约束人的犯罪行为，这个世界从而有了相对的和平与秩序。（律法如同制约罪恶的围栏）
- “We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers – and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine.” (1 Timothy 1:9-10)
- “For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. . . He is God’s servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God’s servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.” (Romans 13:3a, 4)
作官的原不是叫行善的惧怕，乃是叫作恶的惧怕。。。因为他是神的用人，是与你有益的。你若作恶，却当惧怕。因为他不是空空的佩剑。他是神的用人，是伸冤的，刑罚那作恶的。(罗马书13:3a, 4)
This is a SECOND use of the law. God’s threat of eternal punishment keeps people from acting as wickedly and dangerously as they otherwise would. It helps to produce safety for people living in society. QUESTIONS/ COMMENTS?
Submit
6. God also uses the law to give Christians guidance for living a God-pleasing, obedient life of good works. (The law as a Guide to show the way to live)
神用律法指导基督徒的善行，让他们过蒙神喜悦的顺服生活。（律法如同生活向导）
- “How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to Your word.” (Psalm 119:9)
少年人用什么洁净他的行为呢。是要遵行你的话。(诗篇119:9)
- “Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves Me.” (John 14:21)
有了我的命令又遵守的，这人就是爱我的。(约翰福音14:21)
This is the THIRD of the 3 uses of the law. Because we (also Christians!) have a sinful nature, we need to pay attention to the law or we could be deceived by the sinful nature into thinking a certain activity is not sin when in fact it really is; or we might conclude something is sin when in fact it is not. See Psalm 119:105 – ILLUSTRATION – a rope leading the farmer through a blizzard to the barn to feed the animals and then to return safely to the house. QUESTIONS? COMMENTS?
F. Sinful Efforts To Interfere With God’s Purposes In The Law
人类的罪恶努力抵挡神实现律法的目的
Submit
1. All people, by nature, know God’s law and have consciences that witness to their keeping or breaking of the law (Romans 2:14-15). However, their sinful natures hate the powerful, strict and difficult message of the law, refuse to accept it, and fight against the law accomplishing God’s good purposes in their lives.
人的天性知晓神的律法，道德良心可以见证人或遵行或违背了律法（罗马书2:14-15）。然而他们的罪性（罪恶天性）厌恶并拒绝接受神权威、严苛、难以照办的律法信息，阻挠律法在他们的生命中实现神美好的目的。
- “The sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.” (Romans 8:7)
原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇。因为不服神的律法，也是不能服。(罗马书8:7)
- “The law brings wrath.” (Romans 4:15a)
因为律法是惹动忿怒的。(罗马书 4:15a)
Thoughts?
Questions?
Submit
2. In their opposition to God and His law, the sinful natures of people lead them to rebel against the law in such ways as:
人的罪性（罪恶天性）以这样的方式悖逆神与神的律法。
a. Refusing and ignoring the law’s authority over them.
拒绝与忽视神的律法至高无上的权威。
- “In his pride the wicked does not seek Him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God. . . . He is haughty and Your laws are far from him . . . He says to himself, ‘Nothing will shake me; I’ll always be happy and never have trouble” (Psalm 10:4, 5b, 6)
恶人面带骄傲，说，耶和华必不追究。他一切所想的，都以为没有神。。。凡他所作的，时常稳固。你的审判超过他的眼界。他心里说，我必不动摇，世世代代不遭灾难。(诗篇10:4, 5b, 6)
Submit
b. Declaring the law to be evil and sins against it to be good things.
