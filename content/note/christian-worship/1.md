What is worship? 

什么是敬拜？

Genesis 22:5 -- Abram said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."

创世纪22:5 – 亚伯拉罕对他的仆人说：“你们和驴在此等候，我与童子往那里去拜一拜，就回到你们这里来。”

What did Abram and Isaac do "over there"?

亚伯兰和以撒“在那里”做了什么？

Conclusion: Worship is our humble and obedient approach to the true God in prayer, praise and offerings. Worship takes place through special acts and in our entire daily life.

In the Bible, the word worship emphasizes one or more of the meanings just given. Already in the early church, however, the word worship came to be used in the narrower meaning of our church service -- our praise and offerings to God and the proclamation of God to us in Word and Sacrament. In this course we will use the term A worship service when we are thinking of this narrower meaning.

敬拜是我们在祷告、赞美和奉献中以谦卑和顺服的心靠近真神——上帝。我们可以通过特别的仪式来敬拜,也可以通过我们日常的生活来敬拜上帝。

其实,在《圣经》里,“敬拜”一词强调的意思远不止上述的含义。在初期教会中,“敬拜”一词就专指教会礼拜仪式— —会众赞美上帝并向上帝献上奉献同时上帝藉着道和圣礼与我们相交。因此，在这一课中我们提到“敬拜”狭义的含义时，我们会用到“礼拜仪式”这个词。

**Discussion Questions**

**问题讨论**

1. When many Christians think of "worship", they first think of the Sunday church service. What parts of our Sunday service would fit the Biblical description of worship?

    许多基督徒一提到敬拜,首先想到的就是主日教会礼拜仪式。那么我们主日教会礼拜仪式中哪些内容是符合《圣经》对敬拜的描述的呢?

2. What parts of the Sunday service would not be "worship" in its narrowest sense.

    主日教会礼拜仪式的哪些内容不符合“敬拜”狭义的含义呢 ?

3. What aspects of worship mentioned above are usually not part of our worship services on Sunday?

    上述提到的敬拜的含义中,有哪些通常不属于我们主日教会礼拜仪式的范围?

4. When we pray, we "talk to" God -- thanking him, praising him, and often requesting things from him. What makes prayer important is the fact that God hears us and answers our prayers. Thus we might say that prayer is a 2-way conversation -- our talking to God, and his answering us. In what ways is worship also 2-way?

    当我们祷告时,我们与上帝“交通”——感恩、赞美并常常向上帝祈求。祷告对于我们来说非常重要的原因是上帝垂听和回应我们的祷告。因此我们说祷告是双向对话——我们和上帝交通,他回应我们。敬拜中，还有哪些方面也是双向的呢?

5. In what ways is our Sunday church service 2-way?

    我们主日教会礼拜仪式中，哪些方面是双向的交通?

6. Read John 4: 19-24. How does Jesus' understanding of worship differ from that of the woman at the well?

    阅读约翰福音 4:19-24。耶稣理解的敬拜和井边妇人理解的敬拜有什么不同?

Homework: At your worship this weekend, take notes on the service – the order followed, mark what is technically ‘worship’ and what parts are not. If not, why do we have them in the service? Bring your notes to discuss next week in class.

作业：在你们这周末的礼拜仪式中，做礼拜仪式中以下内容的记录——仪式遵循的顺序、标出哪些部分是严格意义上的“敬拜”，哪些不是。如果不是，为什么我们在仪式中保留这些部分？下周上课时，请将你们所做的记录带来进行讨论。
