Worship can be spontaneous, but planned structured worship has advantages.

敬拜可以是自发的，而有准备的敬拜有很多益处

1. Everything a Christian does is worship.

    基督徒要将所做的一切当成是敬拜。

    Romans 12:1 罗马书12:1

    But certain aspects of worship can be taught

    但是需要正确地教导敬拜的某些要素。

    a. ----------------------------------------

    2 Kings 17:28 -- So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the LORD.

    列王记下17:28 -- “于是有一个从撒玛利亚掳去的祭司回来，住在伯特利，指教他们怎样敬畏耶和华。”

    b. -----------------------------------------

    Isaiah 29:13 -- The Lord says: "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men."

    以赛亚书29:13 -- “主说：因为这百姓亲近我，用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。他们敬畏我，不过是领受人的吩咐。”

2. Worship can be planned to include a variety of body language

    我们预备的敬拜可以包括丰富的肢体语言。

    a. -----------------------------------------

    Exodus 33:10 -- Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to his tent.

    出埃及记33:10 -- 众百姓看见云柱立在会幕门前，就都起来，各人在自己帐棚的门口下拜。

    b. -----------------------------------------

    Genesis 24:48 -- And I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham.

    创世记24:48 “随后我低头向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神；因为他引导我走合式的道路，使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女，给我主人的儿子为妻”。

    NOTE: To differentiate themselves from worshipers of pagan statues, early Christians do not seem to have "bowed down" in worship after Jesus' ascension.

    编者按：为区别与异教徒的不同，早期信徒在耶稣升天后的敬拜中不再行跪拜礼。

    c. -----------------------------------------

    2 Chronicles 29:29 -- When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.

    历代志下29:29 -- 献完了祭，王和一切跟随的人都俯伏敬拜。

    d. -----------------------------------------

    2 Chronicles 29:30 -- King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.

    历代志下29:30 -- 希西家王与众首领又吩咐利未人用大卫和先见亚萨的诗词颂赞耶和华。他们就欢欢喜喜地颂赞耶和华，低头敬拜。

3. Worship can be planned for different times and occasions

    敬拜可以在不同时间为不同的事情而预备。

    a. 1 Samuel 1:19 -- Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah.

    撒母耳记上1:19 “次日清早，他们起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛。到了家里，以利加拿和妻哈拿同房，耶和华顾念哈拿。”

    b. Luke 1:10 -- And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.

    路加福音1:10 -- “烧香的时候，众百姓在外面祷告。”

4. Worship can be planned as a complete experience emphasizing Christ's message to us.

    敬拜还可以预备成强调对基督给我们信息的完整经历。

    God’s invitation for us to worship him

    上帝邀请我们敬拜他

    Our Confession of sins to God

    我们向上帝的认罪；

    God's announcement of forgiveness to us

    聆听上帝宣告赦免了我们的罪。

    God's message to us in the Scriptures

    上帝藉着《圣经》赐给我们真道；

    Our response in prayer and song

    我们用祷告和诗歌作回应。

    God's encouragement to us in the sermon

    上帝通过讲道来鼓励我们；

    Our confession of faith in God in the creeds

    我们以信经作为在上帝里的认信。

    Our gifts to God in the offering

    我们以奉献作为给上帝的礼物；

    God's gifts to us in the Sacraments

    上帝通过圣礼给我们恩赐

5. Three important benefits of using a liturgy

    礼文礼拜的三个主要好处：

    a. The use of a liturgy is a good way of ensuring a complete worship experience.

    采用礼文的好处之一是确保完整的敬拜经历。

    b. Except for the sermon, the liturgy can be conducted even without a highly trained leader.

    除了讲道以外，礼文可以用来作为那些没有受过专门训练的带领礼拜的人的引导。

    c. Children and adults who can't read or can't read well can memorize parts of the liturgy and still take part in it.

    采用礼文可以方便那些不会阅读或阅读能力不强的小孩和成人记住礼拜程序并参与进来。

**Discussion Questions**

**问题讨论：**

1. Give examples of when you or Christians you know were moved to spontaneous worship of God.

    举例说说你或你所认识的基督徒在什么时候会自发地敬拜上帝？

2. Give examples of special occasions (besides Sundays) when planned group worship might be appropriate in your church.

    举几个特殊情况时的例子（主日除外），什么时候适合在你们的教会安排集体敬拜。

3. Name and explain any different worship postures used in your church.

    说出你们教会中不同的敬拜肢体语言的名称并进行解释。

    Are there some postures that are inappropriate in your culture?

    有没有一些敬拜的肢体语言不符合你们的文化？

4. How do worship styles and postures vary between different Christian denominations? Are there important reasons why ours differs from others?

    不同教派之间的敬拜方式和肢体语言有什么差异？是什么重要的原因使我们和别人有这些差异？

5. In your church, how are children or new members taught how to worship？

    在你们的教会中，是怎样教导小孩和新会友参与礼拜的？

6. How can we avoid the improper worship which God criticizes in Isaiah 29:13?

    我们怎样才能避免以赛亚书29：13中上帝所批判的那种不合宜的敬拜呢？

7. Read again point 5, then answer these questions.

    再阅读一下第五点，然后回答下列问题：

    a. If we did not use a liturgy, which important parts of the worship experience might we forget? (You might think of different kinds of services in different churches.)

    如果我们不用礼文，礼拜仪式过程中哪些部分有可能被忘记？（你也可以思考不同教会的不同礼拜仪式）。

    b. What are the advantages of having a pastor conduct the entire liturgy?

    由牧师来带领整个礼文有什么好处？

    c. Would there be advantages to having lay people assist in conducting the liturgy?
