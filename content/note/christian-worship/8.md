When we worship we fellowship with God and fellowship with other Christians.

敬拜是我们与上帝之间的交通,也是基督徒之间的团契

1. Worship is foremost a communion or fellowship with God.

    敬拜是与上帝最重要的交通。

    Exodus 24:5 -- Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the LORD.

    又打发以色列人中的少年人去献燔祭，又向耶和华献牛为平安祭。”（出埃及记24:5）

    Deuteronomy 27:7 -- Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.

    “又要献平安祭，且在那里吃，在耶和华你的神面前欢乐。”（申命记27:7）

    1 Corinthians 1:9 -- God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.

    神是信实的，你们原是被他所召，好与他儿子，我们的主耶稣基督，一同得分。”（哥林多前书1:9）

2. At the same time, we share our fellowship with God by enjoying fellowship with other believers.

    同时，我们通过与基督徒一起享受团契生活来与上帝交通。

    1 John 1:3 -- We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

    “我们将所看见、所听见的传给你们，使你们与我们相交，我们乃是与父并他儿子耶稣基督相交的。”（约翰一书1:3）

3. That fellowship with God and other believers becomes very personal in our joint worship services.

    与上帝的交通和与其他基督徒的团契成为我们集体礼拜仪式中非常个人的一部分。

    1 John 1:7 -- But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.

    “我们若在光明中行，如同神在光明中，就彼此相交，他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。”（约翰一书1:7）

    NOTE: Sharing our Lord's body and blood in Holy Communion is one of the most intimate types of fellowship we have. That is one reason for our caution in sharing the Lord's Supper with people who are not members of our own church body (group of churches that are in full agreement with each other).

    编者按：我们在圣餐中共同分享主的身体和宝血是一项最亲密的团契生活。这也是为什么我们对于与非本教团（彼此间完全认同所信的教会群体）的基督徒分享圣餐要非常谨慎的原因。

4. Those who do not have true fellowship with God cannot have fellowship with us either.

    我们也不能与那些与上帝没有真正相交的人有团契关系。

    2 Kings 17:41 -- Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they were serving their idols.

    “如此这些民又惧怕耶和华，又侍奉他们的偶像。他们子子孙孙也都照样行，效法他们的祖宗，直到今日。”（列王记下17:41）

    John 1:6 -- If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.

    “我们若说是与神相交，却仍在黑暗里行，就是说谎话，不行真理了。”（约翰一书1:6）

5. Our common worship and fellowship should only take place with other believers.

    我们通常的敬拜和团契只应在信徒中进行。

    2 Corinthians 6:14 -- Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?

    “你们和不信的原不相配，不要同负一轭。义和不义有什么相交呢？光明和黑暗有什么相通呢？”（哥林多后书6:14）。

    1 Corinthians 5:2 -- And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the [unrepentant] man who did this [public sin]?

    “你们还是自高自大，并不哀痛，把行这事的人从你们中间赶出去。” （哥林多前书5:2）

**Discussion Questions**

**问题讨论：**

1. Read the Old Testament regulations for the fellowship offering in Lev. 7:11-22. Between which two parties is this offering to establish or maintain fellowship? What cause the breaking of fellowship so that an offering was necessary to restore it?

    读旧约《利未记》7:11-22中关于关于平安祭的条例。平安祭在哪两部分中使信徒与上帝建立或保持与上帝相交的关系？什么使得信徒与上帝相交的关系破裂从而使信徒需要平安祭来修复这种关系？

2. Which of the following would you enjoy doing with your closest friends?.

    下面哪一项是你想与你最亲密的朋友一起要做的？

    a. singing songs 唱歌

    b. eating a meal 聚餐

    c. praying 祷告

    d. doing things together 彼此合作

    How do your answers apply to worship services in your church?

    这些跟教会的礼拜仪式有何关系？

3. "Communion" is another word meaning "fellowship." In what way is Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper such an important form of fellowship?

    “圣餐”的另一层意思是“团契”。从哪方面说圣餐是如此重要的团契方式？

4. A church that is practicing ‘closed communion’ or ‘member only communion’ will allow unbelievers or people from other churches to come to worship services, sing songs, etc., but not to have Holy Communion with us? (1 Corinthians 11:27 gives another reason from that mentioned above.)

    一个执行“严密圣餐”或者“会友圣餐”的教会允许非信徒或其他教会的信徒来参加礼拜仪式、唱赞美诗等等，但是不能领圣餐。（哥林多前书11:27中告诉我们为什么要这样做的另一个原因）。
