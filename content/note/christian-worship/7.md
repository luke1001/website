Worship is a universal experience but should reflect a Christian's culture.

敬拜是普世性的经验，但应该反映基督徒的文化

1. Worship changed over the course of Bible history

    历史的进程改变了礼拜模式

    a. Worship in Old Testament times was done with the music and instruments of Jewish culture

    旧约时代的敬拜融合了犹太人的文化及乐器。

    -- Psalm 81:2 -- Begin the music, strike the tambourine, play the melodious harp and lyre.

    “唱起诗歌，打手鼓，弹美琴与瑟。”（诗篇81：2）

    b. Worship in New Testament times was changed to fit the language and culture of that time

    新约时期的敬拜转变为适应时代的语言和文化需要。

    -- Acts 2:4 -- All of [the apostles] were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.“

    他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才，说起别国的话来”（使徒行传2：4）。

2. God taught the Jewish Christians that their culture was no better than other cultures.

    上帝教导犹太基督徒他们的文化并不比别人的好

    -- Acts 10:28 -- Peter said to Cornelius: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.“

    就对他们说：‘你们知道，犹太人和别国的人亲近来往，本是不合例的，但神已经指示我，无论什么人都不可看作俗而不洁净 的。”（使徒行传10：28）

3. Paul makes it clear that worship benefits people only if it is conducted in a language that people understand.

    使徒保罗明确地指出敬拜必须使用人容易懂的语言才能造就人

    1 Corinthians 14:4,9,19 -- He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.... So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.... But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.

    “说方言的，是造就自己；作先知讲道的，乃是造就教会。你们也是如此，舌头若不说容易明白的话，怎能知道所说的是什么呢？这就是向空说话了。但在教会中，宁可用悟性说五句教导人的话，强如说万句方言。”（哥林多前书14：4，9，19）

4. The Bible pictures worship in heaven in ways that were understood to people of ancient times. However, the Bible makes it clear that people from every culture and language will worship God in heaven.

    《圣经》用古人能明白的方式将天上的敬拜描绘出来。同样地，《圣经》也明确地指出有着不同文化背景和语言的人要一同在天上敬拜上帝。

    Revelation 7:9 -- After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."

    “此后，我观看，见有许多的人，没有人能数过来，是从各国、各族、各民、各方来的，站在宝座和羔羊面前，身穿白衣，手拿棕树枝，”（启示录7：9）

5. Since God normally influences the mind and emotions of Christians most intimately through the language and music with which they grow up, worship should, whenever possible, be conducted in that language and with culturally appropriate music.

    上帝通过伴随我们成长的语言和音乐潜移默化地影响基督徒的思想和情感，因此，我们也应该用适合我们文化的语言和音乐来带领我们的敬拜。

    Acts 2:7-11 -- Utterly amazed, they asked: "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs-- we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!"

    “都惊讶希奇说，看哪，这说话的不都是加利利人吗？我们各人，怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？我们帕提亚人，玛代人，以拦人，和住在米所波大米，犹太，加帕多家，本都，亚西亚，弗吕家，旁非利亚，埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的吕彼亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人，革哩底和亚拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说神的大作为。”（使徒行传2：7-11）

    Corinthians 9:20-22 -- [Paul says:] To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. ....I became like one under the law...I became like one not having the law...I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.

    “向犹太人，我就作犹太人，为要得犹太人；向律法以下的人，我虽不在律法以下，还是作律法以下的人，为要得律法以下的人。向没有律法的人，我就作没有律法的人，为要得没有律法的人。其实我在神面前，不是没有律法；在基督面前，正在律法之下。向软弱的人，我就作软弱的人，为要得软弱的人。向什麽样的人，我就作什麽样的人。无论如何总要救些人。”（哥林多前书9：20-22）
