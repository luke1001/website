The God of heaven is with us everywhere, but in a special way in group worship.

天父上帝无处不与我们同在，集体敬拜是上帝与我们同在的一种特殊方式。

1. God is the Lord of Heaven and above all creation and thus deserves our worship.

    上帝是天地万物的主宰，他在万有之上，是配得我们敬拜的。

    a. Ephesians 1:18-21 
    
    以弗所书1:18-21

    b. Malachi 1:6 
    
    玛拉基书1:6

2. Yet God is also present with us personally in worship

    在敬拜中上帝也与我们每个人同在。

    哥林多后书6:16

    b. Matthew 18:20 
    
    马太福音18:20

3. Group worship can also take place anyplace where people can meet.

    集体敬拜的地点可以不受限制。

    a. 2 Samuel 15:32 -- When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.

    大卫到了山顶敬拜神的地方，见亚基人户筛衣服撕裂头蒙灰尘来迎接他。”（撒母耳记下15:32）

    b. “Exodus 29:42 -- "For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD. There I will meet you and speak to you.

    这要在耶和华面前、会幕门口，作你们世世代代常献的燔祭。我要在那里与你们相会，和你们说话。”（出埃及记29:42）

    Note: God does not give a similar command in the New Testament.

    编者按：在新约里上帝没有给类似的命令。

    c. Romans 16:3,5 -- Greet Priscilla and Aquila.... Greet also the church that meets at their house.

    “问百基拉和亚居拉安。……又问在他们家中的教会安。”（罗马书16:3,5）

4. --------------------we worship is not as important as ----------------------we worship.

    --------------------------敬拜要比--------------------------敬拜更重要。

    a. Some worship methods and places are associated with false gods and thus are not acceptable for worship of the true God

    有些敬拜方式和地点会使人联想到假神，因此这些方式和地点是不适合敬拜真神上帝的。

    Deuteronomy 12:2-5

    没有准备的礼拜仪式容易导致混乱和纷争。

    哥林多前书14:26

    d. We should worship the God of the Universe with proper humility, dignity and honor

    尼希米记9:6

    Revelation. 5:8-14
