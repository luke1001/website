God is pleased with our humble worship, but worship is a gift to God and therefore should be the best we can offer.

上帝喜悦我们谦卑的敬拜，但是敬拜也是我们献给上帝的礼物，因此我们应当献上最好的。

1. God is pleased with our most humble worship and offerings.

    上帝喜悦我们最谦卑的敬拜和奉献。

    Luke 18:13-14 -- But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, "God, have mercy on me, a sinner. I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."

    “那税吏远远地站着,连举目望天也不敢,只捶着胸说:‘神啊,开恩可怜我这个罪人!’我告诉你们:这人回家去比那人倒算为义了。因为凡自高的,必降为卑;自卑的,必升为高。”(路加福音18:13-14)

    Mark 12:42-43 -- But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.

    “有一个穷寡妇来,往里投了两个小钱,就是一个大钱。耶稣叫门徒来,说:‘我实在告诉你们,这穷寡妇投入库里的,比众人所投的更多’。” (马可福音12:42-43)

2. Yet God is not pleased with improper worship

    但是上帝不喜悦不恭敬的敬拜。

    a. Worship is improper when it is just empty words

    只是空话的敬拜是不恭敬的:

    -- Matthew 15:8-9 -- These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me uselessly; their teachings are but rules taught by men.

    “这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我,心却远离我;他们将人的吩咐当作道理教导人,所以拜我也是枉然。”(马太福音15:8-9)

    b. Worship is improper when it is directed to a false God

    把人引向假神的敬拜是不恭敬的:

    -- Deuteronomy 12:31 -- You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.

    “你不可向耶和华你的神这样行,因为他们向他们的神行了耶和华所憎嫌、所恨恶的一切事, 甚至将自己的儿女用火焚烧,献与他们的神。”(申命记12:31)

    c. Worship is improper when it contains afalse message

    参差了错误信息的敬拜是不恭敬的:

    -- Colossians 2:23 -- Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

    “这些规条使人徒有智慧之名,用私意礼拜,自表谦卑,苦待己身,其实在克制肉体的情欲上是毫无功效。”(歌罗西书2:23)

    d. Worship is improper when the worshiper is leading an ungodly life.

    把人引向不圣洁生活的敬拜是不恭敬的:

    -- Amos 5:21-24 -- I hate, I despise your religious feasts; I cannot stand your assemblies. Even though you bring me burnt offerings..., I will not accept them.... But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!

    “我厌恶你们的节期,也不喜悦你们的严肃会。你们虽然向我献燔祭和素祭,我却不悦纳;也不顾你们用肥畜献的平安祭;要使你们歌唱的声音远离我,因为我不听你们弹琴的响声。惟愿公平如大水滚滚,使公义如江河滔滔。”(阿摩司书5:21-24)

3. Therefore we should worship carefully:

    因此我们应该用心敬拜上帝:

    1)so that we worship the true God only

    我们应该敬拜独一真神

    2)so that everything said and done conveys a biblical message,

    我们所说的和所做的都应当传达《圣经》的信息

    3)so that our worship is not disrespectful or just empty words

    我们的敬拜不应当是不敬虔的或只是空话

    4)so that our lives reflect our love and praise of God.

    我们的生活要彰显对上帝的爱和赞美

4. God asks us to give our best gifts to Him as a sign of our love. Therefore, our worship should be giving God our best in preparation, music, sermons, prayers, offerings and attention.

    上帝要求我们献上最好的礼物作为爱的标记。因此,我们应当在敬拜的准备、音乐、讲道、祷告、奉献和关注中献上我们最好的。

    Malachi 1:8 -- When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?" says the LORD Almighty.

    “你们将瞎眼的献为祭物,这不为恶吗?将瘸腿的、有病的献上,这不为恶吗?你献给你的省长,他岂喜悦你,岂能看你的情面吗? 这是万军之耶和华说的。”(玛拉基书 1:8)

**Discussion Questions**

**问题讨论：**

1. Some churches do not plan their services. They simply meet and "let the Holy Spirit lead them." Is this a more "spiritual" approach than planning worship ahead of time?

    有些教会不为礼拜仪式做准备。只要大家聚集在一起“让圣灵来带领”就行了。你认为这样的礼拜是否比有准备的礼拜更 “属灵”?

2. Our worship services follow a plan and usually contain most of the following elements. Number them to show the order in which they usually occur in your church. Then tell why each is planned into the service and why it is done in that order.

    我们的主日礼拜有一个程序并且通常包括以下所列的大多数内容。请将以下内容进行排序以显示出通常他们在你们教会礼拜仪式进行的顺序。然后说明为什么这些内容中的每一项要被包括在仪式中以及为什么要以这样的顺序来安排。

    Confession of Faith (Creed) 认信 (按照信经)

    Prayers 祷告

    Blessing 祝福

    Lord's Supper 圣餐

    Confession of Sins 认罪文

    Lord's Prayer 主祷文

    Sermon 讲道

    Scripture Readings 读经

    Absolution (forgiveness of sins) 赦罪

    Offering 奉献

    Praise 赞美

3. From time to time your congregation probably has worship services that are "special" and do not come straight from the prepared services in the hymnal. Can you remember how you reacted to such services? What things did you like or not like about them?

    有时你们的教会可能会有“特殊的”礼拜仪式不是直接来自赞美诗集中已经预备好的仪式。你还记得你对这样的礼拜仪式的反应是怎样的吗？这样的仪式中的哪些部分是你所喜欢的，哪些是你所不喜欢的？

4. People sometimes complain that the worship services in our hymnals becomes boring because we use them again and again. Can you think of ways that churches can keep that from happening and still have well planned worship?

    有时人会抱怨重复使用赞美诗集里的礼拜仪式太枯燥了。你想到消除这种抱怨并保持有序的礼拜仪式的方法吗？
