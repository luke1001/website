Worship is both a personal and group activity

敬拜是个人和集体的属灵生活

1. All Christians can worship God individually and personally.

    基督徒都可以单独地和私下地敬拜上帝。

    1 Peter 2:5 -- You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

    彼得前书2:5 --你们来到主面前，也就像活石，被建造成为灵宫，作圣洁的祭司，藉着耶稣基督奉献神所悦纳的灵祭。

    This is often called the universal priesthood of all believers.

    编者按：这常被称为信徒皆祭司。

2. Christians worship individually in their hearts

    基督徒可以独自在心里敬拜上帝

    a. Alone
    
    a. 独自地

    Matthew 26:36 -- Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."

    马太福音26:36 -- “耶稣同门徒来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼，就对他们说：‘你们坐在这里，等我到那边去祷告’。”

    Our every breath should be prayer and praise

    我们要不住地祷告，常常地赞美。

    1 Corinthians 10:31 -- So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
哥林多前书10:31 “所以你们或吃或喝，无论做什么，都要为荣耀神而行。”

    But we also are moved to worship God for special blessings

    但是我们也会因为得到了特别的祝福而敬拜上帝。

    Genesis 24:48 -- And I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has led me to get the granddaughter of my master's brother [as a husband] for his son.

    创24:48 －我们要为领受了特别的祝福而敬拜上帝。“随后我低头向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神，因为他引导我走合适的道路，使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女，给我主人的儿子为妻。”

3. Christians also worship in groups (as the Church)

    基督徒聚集在一起（作为教会）敬拜上帝

    a. As part of our fellowship –

    成为团契的一员。

    Acts 2:46 -- Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts.

    使徒行传2:46 — “他们天天同心合意恒切地在殿里，且在家中擘饼，存着欢喜、诚实的心用饭。”

    b. To encourage each other –

    当互相勉励，彼此扶持。

    Hebrews 10:25 -- Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another-- and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

    希伯来书10:25 －“你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。”

    c. As a witness and proclamation to others

    向别人做见证。

    Psalm 102:21-22 -- So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.

    诗篇102:21-22 －“使人在锡安传扬耶和华的名，在耶路撒冷传扬赞美他的话，就是在万民和列国聚会侍奉耶和华的时候。”

4. Christ is with us in group worship.

    我们聚会时基督临在我们中间。

    a. Jesus says so–

    耶稣这样说：

    Matthew 18:20 -- For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.

    马太福音18:20－ “因为无论在哪里，有两三个人奉我的名聚会，那里就有我在他们中间。”

    b. Group worship is a natural expression of faith -

    聚会是基督徒信心的自然体现。

    Psalm 102:22 -- ....when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.

    诗篇102:22－ “就是在万民和列国聚会侍奉耶和华的时候。”

5. The Christian family has a special opportunity to grow and worship together.

    基督徒家庭具有信心共同成长和一同敬拜的特殊机会。

    Exodus 12:25-27 When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?' then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD...."

    出埃及记12:25-27： “日后，你们到了耶和华按着所应许赐给你们的那地，就要守这礼。你们的儿女问你们说：‘行这礼是什么意思？’你们就说：‘这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。当以色列人在埃及的时候，他击杀埃及人，越过以色列人的房屋，救了我们各家。’于是百姓低头下拜。”

    2 Timothy 3:15 -- And how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

    提摩太后书3:15： “并且知道你是从小明白圣经，这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣有得救的智慧。”
