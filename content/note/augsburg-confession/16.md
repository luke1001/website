Of Confession they teach that Private Absolution ought to be retained in the churches, although in confession an enumeration of all sins is not necessary. For it is impossible, according to the Psalm: Who can understand his errors? (Psalm 19:12)

关于认罪他们认为， 尽管认罪不需要罗列所有的罪但是个人罪得赦免应该是在教堂里。 因为根据诗篇：谁能知道自己的错失是不可能的。（诗篇 19:12）

#### CONFESSING OUR SINS 认罪

From little on many Christians are taught “You don’t have to confess your sins to anyone, but Jesus Christ.” But is that always the case? What does the Scripture state when I offend someone? What does the Scripture state about Christians confessing their sins to each other? Must a pastor know the details of my heart, where I error against God? Is there benefit to confessing our sins to our pastor? Is there benefit to confessing our sins to our fellow Christians?

很多基督徒从小都听到这样的教导：“除了主耶稣之外，你不需要向任何人认罪。” 但是果真是这样的吗？ 当我冒犯别人的时候圣经是如何教导的呢？ 关于基督徒之间彼此认罪圣经是如何教导的呢？牧师需要知道我心里具体所想的，到底哪里得罪了神吗？ 向牧师承认罪过有益处吗？向其他基督徒同伴承认罪过有益处吗？

• This study addresses these and many more questions that Christian have had regarding the confessing of their sins. Before we study the abuses of the Roman Catholic Church regarding their understanding of confession, let’s look at what the Biblical teaching of Confession laid out by our Lutheran forefathers according to God’s Word.

本次学习涵盖这些和其他很多基督徒关于认罪的问题。之前我们学习了罗马天主教对于认罪的错误认识， 让我们一起看一下路德宗前辈们按照神的话给我们的合乎圣经的教导。

The Ministry of the Keys
天国钥匙的事工

![](/images/note/ags/16-1.jpg#right)

Christ gave his church on earth the Gospel in both Word and Sacrament (Baptism and the Lord’s Supper) to read, teach, and administer to his flock here on earth until he brings his flock home to eternity. The gospel in Word and Sacrament are the precious means of grace by which God calls the Christian to faith, and then after faith is created in their hearts, he sustains that faith through these special means.

基督给地上教会赐下他的话语和圣礼（洗礼和圣餐）， 是我们需要研读、教导和用来帮助他的群羊， 直等到他再来召他的群羊回永恒天家时。神的话语和圣礼是神恩典的宝贵形式， 神藉此呼召并赐给基督徒信心，然后又通过这两种形式来稳固他们信心。

The church (body of believers/called out) has been entrusted with a set of keys that Jesus gave to them. These keys lock heaven from impenitent sinners that is sinners who refuse to repent of their sin. They lock them out of heaven by refusing to announce absolution to them or forgive them of their sins. But to those who repent of sin, Christians unlock the door of heaven by announcing to them absolution for forgiveness on account of Jesus’ merit. This we call the ministry of the keys. Read the following…

主耶稣赐给并委托给教会（信徒共同组成的身体/呼召出来的）很多钥匙。这些钥匙使未悔改罪人也就是拒不认罪悔改的人与天堂隔绝。但是对已经悔改的人， 基督徒通过向他们传讲主耶稣的赦罪之恩而打开他们通向天的门。我们称之为钥匙的事工。请读以下…

John 20:21-23 Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you." And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

约翰福音20:21-23 耶稣又对他们说，愿你们平安。父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。 说了这话，就向他们吹一口气，说，你们受圣灵。 你们赦免谁的罪，谁的罪就赦免了。你们留下谁的罪，谁的罪就留下了。

• The use of the keys is a special power given to Christ's holy people, the believers. Every believer is a person chosen by God to inherit eternal life and to be a priest here on earth. A priest is a person who has access to God and who has the privilege of serving God. As priests we share in the power of the use of the keys. Pastors and other servants in the public ministry are no more important than those who do not hold such offices, because every believer is a priest in the eyes of God. When believers join together to exercise the use of the keys, this is as valid and certain, in heaven also, as if Christ dealt with us himself. Elsewhere, in the gospel of St. Matthew, Jesus states…

使用这些钥匙是基督赐给他的圣洁子民的特别权柄。每位信徒都是神拣选承受永生和作大祭司的。祭司就是可以进到神的面前并有权力来服侍神的人。作为祭司我们都有权力来使用这些钥匙。牧师和在事工中的其他仆人不比没有这些职位头衔的人更重要，因为在神的眼中每一位信徒都是祭司。当信徒一起来使用这些钥匙的时候，这就跟神亲自做工一样，即便在天上也是如此。 此外， 在马太福音，耶稣如此说道…

Matthew 16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

马太福音 16:19 我要把天国的钥匙给你。凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑。凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。

Matthew 18:15-18  15"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. 16But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'17If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. 18"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

马太福音 18:15-18 倘若你的弟兄得罪你，你就去趁着只有他和你在一处的时候，指出他的错来。他若听你，你便得了你的弟兄。16他若不听，你就另外带一两个人同去，要凭两三个人的口作见证，句句都可定准。17 若是不听他们，就告诉教会。若是不听教会，就看他像外邦人和税吏一样。18 我实在告诉你们，凡你们在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑。凡你们在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。

1. When a brother or sister in the faith sins against us, what does Jesus tell us should be the first three steps before removing him/her from the assembly of believers…

    当弟兄或姊妹犯罪得罪我们的时候， 主耶稣教导我们在把他/她从总信徒中驱除之前有那三步要做…

    1). Show him his fault, just between the two of you (1:1 approach, more effective and loving way, save someone’s reputation)

    告诉他所犯的错，只在你们两人中间（ 一对一，更有效更仁爱，不破坏别人名誉）

    2). Take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses

    带一两个人一起，以便每一件事都有两三个见证人。

    3). Tell it to the church

    告诉教会。

2. If the church gets through to him or her regarding their sinful behavior, what is the church supposed to do…

    如果教会使他或她认识到了犯罪行为，教会应该如何做…
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/16-2.jpg#right)

    a. Use the binding key

    使用捆绑的钥匙

    b. Use the loosing key

    使用释放的钥匙

    Luther’s Small Catechism says this about Confession: “Confession has two parts. The one is that we confess our sins; the other, that we receive absolution or forgiveness from the pastor as from God himself, not doubting but firmly believing that our sins are thus forgiven before God in heaven.”

    路德小问答关于认罪是这样说的： “认罪分两部分。其中一个是承认我们的罪；另外一个是接受从牧师也就是从神来的赦免，并且对我们的罪在天父面前蒙赦免深信不疑。

    **What does the Scripture state… 圣经是如何教导的…**
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/16-3.jpg#right)

    James 5:16 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.

    雅各书 5:16 所以你们要彼此认罪，互相代求，使你们可以得医治。

    Matthew 5:23-24 Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.”

    马太福音 5:23-24 所以你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨， 就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。

    Respond: Jeffrey and Denise were members at the same church as Susan and Eric, but the two couples had a verbal argument over something. These two couples could hardly stand seeing each other at church, but unfortunately because they went to the same church they had no choice not to see each other. Apply the passage from Matthew 5:23-24. What ought to take place before these two couples come to church and try offering a gift to Jesus?

    杰弗里和丹尼斯跟苏珊和艾里克是同一教会会友， 但是两对夫妇曾因一些事情发生过口角。这两对夫妇在教会中水火不容， 但是因为都属于同一教会却没有办法彼此不见面。 请应用马太福音5:23-24。这两对夫妇在到教堂向主奉献之前应该做什么？

    I Corinthians 8:7,12 “...Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. (12) When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.”

    哥林多前书 8:7，12 

    7 有人到如今因拜惯了偶像，就以为所吃的是祭偶像之物。他们的良心既然软弱，也就污秽了。

    12 你们这样得罪弟兄们，伤了他们软弱的良心，就是得罪基督。

3. What obligation do we have towards our Christian brothers and sisters?

    对我们的基督徒弟兄姊妹我们有什么责任？

4. What is the danger if a person tries to bottle up their sins and not talk to anyone about their problems in life?

    如果一个对自己的罪守口如瓶不跟其他人分享生活中的问题有什么危险？

#### What do the various churches teach regarding Confession 众教会关于认罪的教导

**Roman Catholicism 罗马天主教**

In the Catholic Church, the sacrament of Penance consists of three parts: contritio, confessio and satisfactio.

在天主教，忏悔包括三部分：悔罪，认罪，补赎。

Contritio (Contrition) is in fact repentance as Protestant theologians understand it, that is love of God causing sorrow for sins committed. Where Rome differs from the Protestants is that the Council of Trent decided that no reconciliation to God could follow the contrition of the person without the other two parts – confession to a priest and satisfaction for those sins.

悔罪也就是新教神学所说的悔改，是因为看到神的爱而产生的对罪的悔恨。然而罗马对此有不同看法，特伦托会议决定如果没有另外两个过程—向神父忏悔和赦免—我们便不能从新再与神和好。

According to Roman Catholic tradition, the offender of the Word of God (confessor) accuses himself of his sins to an ordained priest (known as confessor). The priest may then offer advice and imposes a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an Act of Contrition, the priest administers absolution, thus formally forgiving the penitent of his sins, and finally sends him out with words of dismissal. Often, penitential acts consist simply of prayers, fasting, charitable work or giving, or a combination thereof. Such penance is frequently accompanied by a requirement for the penitent to be reconciled with anyone against whom he or she has sinned. The most common penances involve the recitation of standard prayers, such as the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary, meditation on particular scriptural passages, or praying the rosary with special penitential intentions. The priest is bound by the seal of confession not to reveal or discuss a penitent’s sins with others. Violation of the seal of confession incurs the most severe ecclesiastical penalty of excommunication for the violating priest. The confession can be made face-to-face or in a private confessional with a screen dividing the priest and person confessing sins.

根据罗马天主教传统，违背神（听忏悔者）话语的人向按立的神父（所谓的听忏悔者）述说自己的罪过。神父然后会给出建议并强加以具体的苦行。忏悔者然后以痛悔经做祷告 ，神父然后施行赦免，罪也因此正式得到饶恕，最后神父再以一些言辞打发忏悔者离开。悔罪行为通常有祷告、禁食、善行或奉献或几者兼有。通常这样的苦行还包括要求忏悔者与他所得罪的所有人去和好。最常见的苦行通常包括背诵公祷词，如主祷文和万福马利亚 ，对一些特定经文的默想，或为具体事情忏悔的念珠祷告。神父必须对忏悔内容封口不能透露也不能与别人讨论忏悔者的罪。如果神父对别人的忏悔内容没有封口将会面临教会最严重的惩罚也就是驱逐出会。忏悔可以面对面，也可以用一个屏风使忏悔者和神父隔开。

• In my personal experience with Roman Catholics, this is how they explained their 3-part confession to me. If a dad tells his son not to throw the ball around the house, for fear that his son might break a window, and his son disobeys his father and throws the ball around the house, eventually breaking a window. This is how a loving father will deal with the situation: He will forgive his son for his error, but will then say, you must pay for the window that you broke so that you learn your lesson not to disobey me. So then the son pays with his allowance for the window.

根据我个人与罗马天主教打交道的经验，他们对忏悔的三部分的解释是这样的。 如果一个爸爸告诉儿子不要在房间内扔球因为这样可能会打坏玻璃的，但是儿子却不听话在房间内玩球并且打坏了玻璃。慈爱的爸爸是这样处理这件事情的：他会原谅儿子所犯的错，但是会要儿子赔偿打坏的窗户以便儿子能吸取不听话的教训。然后儿子用自己的零花钱赔上了这个窗户。

1. What’s wrong with this view when it comes to God and what the Bible says?

    对比神和圣经所教导的，这种观点错在哪里？

    Psalm 32:1,2 Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the LORD does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.

    诗篇 32:1,2 得赦免其过，遮盖其罪的，这人是有福的。凡心里没有诡诈，耶和华不算为有罪的，这人是有福的。

2. Why doesn’t God count our transgressions against us?

    为什么神不计算我们的罪过？

    **Anglicanism (Church of England) 英格兰圣公会（英国教会）**

    Private confession of sins to a priest, followed by absolution, has always been provided for in the Book of Common Prayer. In the Communion Service of the 1662 English Prayer Book, for example, we read:

    个人向神父认罪忏悔然后神父赦免在公祷书中随处可见。例如在1662年英国的圣餐礼祈祷书中写道：

    And because it is requisite, that no man should come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in God’s mercy, and with a quiet conscience; therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means [that is, by personal confession of sins] cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further comfort or counsel; let him come to me, or to some other discreet and learned Minister of God’s Word, and open his grief; that by the ministry of God’s holy Word he may receive the benefit of absolution, together with spiritual counsel and advice, to the quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.

    若非相信神的怜悯并存无愧的良心，任何人不能够参加圣餐礼，这是必须的。因此，如果你们中有人通过这种方法（个人忏悔）不能使自己良心无愧，而需要进一步的安慰或劝告，这人应该来见我或其他成熟有见识的牧师并说出自己的痛苦；因着神圣洁的话语他必得赦免之恩并属灵的劝告和建议，可以使良心无愧并消除顾虑和疑问。

    • Lutherans have absolutely no problem with this understanding of confession, so long as confession to a pastor is not forced upon the Christian, but rather is voluntary. In fact, it was Luther who first stated that after confession takes place, absolution must immediately follow, based on what the Bible teaches us. Immediately after David confessed his sins of adultery and murder to the prophet Nathan, Nathan announced to David, “The Lord has taken away your sin.”

    只要对牧师的忏悔不是被迫的而是自愿的，路德宗对这段关于忏悔的理解毫无疑义。事实上， 是路德最早提出根据圣经教导认罪后立即会蒙赦免。在大卫向先知拿单承认他的淫乱和谋杀之罪后，拿单立即向大卫宣告，“主已经除去了你的罪”。

    • The Augsburg Confession divides repentance into two parts: "One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."

    奥格斯堡信经将悔改分为两部分：“一个是悔罪，因为认识罪而产生的内心的恐惧；另外一个是来自福音的信心，或者说是来自赦免的，相信因为基督的缘故，罪得赦免，因此内心不再恐惧反得安慰。

    ![](/images/note/ags/16-4.jpg#right)

    •  Lutherans reject the teaching that forgiveness is obtained through penance assigned by the priest to satisfy the anger of our Father in heaven.

    路德宗反对赦免是因为通过神父委派的苦行抵消了天父的怒气而得到的。

3. What do you notice different about Luther’s explanation of Confession verses the Roman Catholic procedure of confession and penance?

    路德关于认罪的解释跟罗马天主教关于认罪和苦行的程序有什么区别？

4. Is there doctrinal verification that Christians ought to practice private confession with absolution? (Remember Jesus’ words in Matthew 18:15-18)

    基督徒应该有个人认罪和赦罪，这有经文依据吗？（记住耶稣在马太福音18:15-18节的话）

5. Can Christians confess their sin in the privacy of their own homes, just to God and nobody else?

    基督徒能不能自在自己家中仅仅向神而不向其他人认罪？16-5

    ![](/images/note/ags/16-5.jpg#right)

    1 John 1:8-10 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.

    约翰一书 1:8-10 我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了。 我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义。 我们若说自己没有犯过罪，便是以神为说谎的。他的道也不在我们心里了。

    The answer to question number 5 is yes. Luther’s small Catechism addresses this as well when he says, “Before God we should plead guilty of all sins, even those we are not aware of, as we do in the Lord’s Prayer.”

    关于问题五的答案是肯定的。路德在他小问答中很好的阐述了这个问题：“正如在主祷文中我们所祷告的，我们要承认我们所有的罪，包括隐而未现的罪。

6. What, then, might be the benefit of confessing our sins to those we have offended?

    如果这样向我们得罪的人认罪有什么益处呢？

7. What, then, might be the benefit to talk to our pastor privately about the sins that are plaguing our minds and tormenting our consciences?

    如果这样私下跟我们的牧师讲困扰和折磨我们良心的罪有什么益处呢？

    In the following words from Paul, he is speaking to a young pastor by the name of Timothy. Read the following…

    以下一段经文是保罗向一个名叫提摩太的年轻牧师说的话。 请读以下…

    2 Timothy 2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/16-6.jpg#right)

    提摩太后书 2:15 你当竭力，在神面前得蒙喜悦，作无愧的工人，按着正意分解真理的道。

    • In the Lord’s Prayer we ask God to forgive us our trespasses without stopping to specify any sins in particular. We plead guilty in a general way, as did the publican in the temple: “God, have mercy on me, a sinner” (Luke 18:13).

    在主祷文中我们求神免我们的债但并没有说出具体的债。 我们是一种笼统的认罪方式，正如税吏在殿里的祷告：“神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人”。（路加福音18:13）

    •  Let us never conceal our sins. For such a man would be a fool. King Solomon wrote: Proverbs 28:13 He who conceals his sins does not prosper.” David tried this method, but listen to his story: “When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer” (Psalm 32:3,4).

    让我们不要遮掩自己的罪。因为这样的人是愚昧的。所罗门王这样写道：箴言28:13“ 遮掩自己罪过的，必不亨通”。大卫曾尝试这么做，让我们看一下他的故事：“我闭口不认罪的时候，因终日唉哼，而骨头枯乾。黑夜白日，你的手在我身上沉重。我的精液耗尽，如同夏天的乾旱”（诗篇32:3,4）

    Only when sins are honestly confessed will the Lord intervene to forgive: David says, “Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, ’I will confess my transgressions to the LORD’ - and you forgave the guilt of my sin” (Psalm 32:5).
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/16-7.jpg#right)

    只有当我们诚实的承认自己的罪的时候神才会赦免：大卫说道，“我向你陈明我的罪，不隐瞒我的恶。我说，我要向耶和华承认我的过犯，你就赦免我的罪”（诗篇32:5）

    • God does not forgive us our sins if we refuse to confess them. But also notice that he doesn’t delay in forgiving them when we do confess them.

    如果我们不认罪神就不会赦免我们的罪。但是也要知道当我们认罪的时候神赦免我们的罪从不耽搁。

8. What often stands in the way from a person coming to their pastor in confidence to talk about their sins?

    哪些东西经常使我们不能心无挂虑的向牧师述说我们的罪？

    **Difference between Godly Sorrow and Worldly Sorrow 属天忧愁与属世忧愁之差别**

    2 Corinthians 7:10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.

    哥林多后书 7:10 因为依着神的意思忧愁，就生出没有后悔的懊悔来，以致得救。但世俗的忧愁，是叫人死。

    Consider the sin, sorrow, and end result between two of Jesus disciples – Judas Iscariot and Simon Peter.

    比较耶稣的两个门徒—加略人犹大和西门彼得—的罪、痛悔和最后结局。

    Sin of Judas –

    犹大之罪

    Sin of Simon Peter –

    彼得之罪

9. Was one sin greater than the other?

    有的罪会比其他的罪更大一些吗？

10. How did both express sorrow for their sin?

    两个人对罪的痛悔各有什么不同？

11. What was the end result? (Read the following)

    最后的结局有什么不同？（请读以下经文）

Matthew 27:3-5 When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.”  “What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.”  5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.

马太福音 27:3-5 这时候，卖耶稣的犹大，看见耶稣已经定了罪，就后悔，把那三十块钱，拿回来给祭司长和长老说，我卖了无辜之人的血， 是有罪了。他们说，那与我们有什么相干。你自己承当吧。犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里，出去吊死了。

Matthew 26:75 Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.

马太福音 26:75 彼得想起耶稣所说的话，鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。他就出去痛哭。

Don’t mistake the tears of Peter as something more deserving of God’s forgiveness than Judas confession, “I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood.” For if we say that one was more contrite than the other, we fall into the trap of placing a condition on our forgiveness based on the sincerity of the remorse of the person.

不要以为彼得的眼泪比犹大的更值得神的赦免，“我卖了无辜之人的血，是有罪了”。因为如果我们说一个人比另外一个人更痛悔，我们就陷入了把人的痛悔的真实程度作为得赦免的条件这样一个圈套。

• Peter could have just as easily taken a rope and hung himself, but the grace of God is the only sufficient answer to why Peter did not. If you read in John’s gospel, the very last chapter, after Jesus rose from the dead, you hear a very beautiful discord of Jesus restoring Simon Peter to faith and commissioning him to now serve him with boldness.

彼得也可以简单的找一条绳子把自己吊死，但是神的恩典是使彼得为什么没有这么做的答案。读约翰福音最后一章，也就是在耶稣从死里复活后，你就会看到耶稣再一次让彼得恢复信心并差派他放胆的去侍奉神。

• Grace saved Peter, and grace has saved you and me. And only by God’s grace do we confess our sins to God or the people we offend, or to our pastors. Only let us not be so proud so as to keep these sins bottled up inside of us. Let us release our need to confess both to God and to our fellow man so that healing and forgiveness might be immediately announced!

是恩典救了彼得，也是恩典救了你我。是因为神的恩典我们才能向神或我们的罪的人或牧师去认罪。让我们不要骄傲以至于把我们的罪埋在心里。让我们释放认罪的需要，向我们的神和我们所得罪的人去认罪，使我们可以立刻宣告医治和赦免！
