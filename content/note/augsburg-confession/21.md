Of Usages in the Church they teach that those ought to be observed which may be observed without sin, and which are profitable unto tranquility and good order in the Church, as particular holy-days, festivals, and the like. Nevertheless, concerning such things men are admonished that consciences are not to be burdened, as though such observance was necessary to salvation. They are admonished also that human traditions instituted to propitiate God, to merit grace, and to make satisfiaction for sins, are opposed to the Gospel and the doctrine of faith. Wherefore vows and traditions concerning meats and days, etc., instituted to merit grace and to make satisfaction for sins, are useless and contrary to the gospel.

关于教会礼仪他们教导那些不会让人陷入罪中的传统应该继承，还有对教会的安定和次序有益的，如圣日、节日之类。然而却要告诫大家不要让这些东西成为捆绑，好像只有守这些才能得救一样。还要告诫大家不要认为人的传统是为了止息神的怒气，为了赢得恩典，或是为了赎自己的罪，这是违背福音和信的教导的。因此为了赢得恩典和赎罪而设立的关于食物、日期之类的誓言和传统，这些都是无用的是违背福音的。

Let us note right off the bat that this article drawn up by our forefathers speaks of ecclesiastical usages or church usages, meaning rites and ceremonies that were instituted by men. Today’s focus then, in regards to “church rites,” will cover what is commonly called Adiaphoron, or Matters of Indifference, something that is neither commanded by God nor forbidden by him.

我们应该认识到由前辈们起草的本篇是在讲论教会礼仪，也就是人所设立的礼仪和仪式。今天关于教会仪式我们的重点在通常所说的可做可不做之事，或无关紧要的事，也是神既没有要求也没有禁止的事。

1) What’s the difference between a “church rite” and the means of grace?

1）“教会仪式”跟恩典途径有什么区别？

2) How might a group of believers become guilty of changing the means of grace into just another church rite?

2）信徒们可能怎样犯罪去把恩典的途径变为一种宗教仪式？

3) How might one become guilty of changing a church rite into a means which conveys grace?

3）人可能怎样犯罪去把教会仪式变为恩典的途径？

The means of grace must be administered for the maintenance of the church and for the winning of souls. These rites, Jesus himself instituted, and concerning these rites there can be no question as to their application in the church. Otherwise, one ceases to have the mark(s) of a Christian church. For the Gospel, proclaimed in Word and Sacrament are the means through which God is conveying his grace to us and is kindling and preserving faith in our hearts.

恩典的途径是为了坚固教会和拯救灵魂。耶稣所设立的这些仪式可以毫无疑问的用在教会之中。不然教会就不再有基督的印记了。因为通过神的话和圣礼所传的福音是神恩典的途径，为要唤起和坚固我们的信心。

The point in our article that is to be stressed by our forefathers is that “consciences are not to be burdened.” There is only one thing in the whole wide world that can bind our consciences, and that is what?

本篇的中心也就是我们前辈们所强调的“莫让良心有愧”。世上只有一样东西可以约束我们的良心，那是什么呢？

4) When God commands something to us in his Word, consciences are…

4）当神要我们在他的话中行事的时候，我们的良心…

5) When God in his Word offers us anything to believe or place our trust in, the conscience is…

5）当神在他的道中要我们相信或信靠时，我们的良心…

6) When God in his Word designates certain means for conveying his grace, consciences are…

6）当神在他的道中告诉我们他赐恩一些方式得时候，我们的良心…

Unfortunately, throughout the whole course of the church’s history men have, often with the best of intentions, tried to impose on the church some usages or rites, which God has said nothing about in his Word, binding them upon the hearts of men as though in some way God has commanded them. Consider some of these rites that other churches have imposed on others that are not commanded of us in God’s Word…

不幸的是，在整个教会历史中，人总是好心的去给教会增加一些毫无圣经依据的传统或仪式，把他们如同神的命令一样强加在人心上。思考一下其它教会强加于人的神的话并没有要求的这样的一些仪式。

• What we eat and when we eat it

我们吃什么和何时吃

• What we drink and what we don’t drink

我们喝什么和不喝什么

• How we dress

穿什么

• The mode of Baptism (dunked, washed, sprinkled etc.)

受洗方式（浸水、冲水、点水等）

• How often we make it to church

多长时间去一次教会

• Gifts of the Spirit

圣灵的恩赐

Read the following…

请读以下经文…

Acts 15:1 Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”

使徒行传15:1 有几个人，从犹太下来，教训弟兄们说，你们若不按摩西的规条受割礼，不能得救。

Against such abuses, which many of them we have already talked about, our forefathers at Augsburg spoke out against with great fervor.

针对这些滥用—其中一些我们已经谈过—我们的前辈在奥格斯堡有过强烈的抨击。

7) How far should we go as fellow Christians with our brothers and sisters as far as their activity or involvement in church goes? Consider what our forefathers said before answering.

7）对在参加教会的我们的弟兄姊妹们，哪些我们可以做哪些我们不可以做？回答之前请先考虑我们前辈们所说的。

“No ceremony, with the sole exception of the preaching of the Word in any form and the administration of the sacraments, is necessary for salvation.”

“除了以各种形式传讲神的话和圣礼之外，没有任何礼仪是得救必须的。”

8) How do Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter fit into this discussion?

8）如何把像圣诞节和复活节这样的节日加到我们这样的讨论中？

• As an example, take our Sundays. What would we do about divine services, about joint prayer, and about celebrating Holy Communion if we did not have some specified day and hour in which to meet? The greatest confusion would result without such a fixed usage; some might even be deprived of the opportunity of ever taking part in a divine service and of receiving Communion with the congregation and that would truly be a shame.

拿礼拜天作为例子。如果没有特定的日子和时间聚在一起，那么我们如何崇拜，如何一同祷告和如何领受圣餐呢？如果没有固定的传统习惯就会引起混乱；甚至有人根本不能参加崇拜和领受圣餐，这将是一个羞辱。

• For that reason we urge that some usages ought to be observed by fellow believers. Neglecting Sunday may easily lead to a despising of the Word of God, to a despising of the fellowship of Christians, to a despising of the sacraments, to a despising of singing spiritual hymns and of praying and giving thanks to God.

正是为此我们主张有些礼仪应该继承。不守礼拜天很容易导致藐视神的话，藐视基督徒团契生活，藐视圣礼，藐视灵歌圣诗和向神祷告和感恩。

But as far as what sort of meat we eat, and which day we designate for worship, prayers, fastings, vigils, pilgrimages, donating candles, the reading of Mass, and the like, these lay only in the traditions of men and should be taught as such. And whenever any of these are done for the sake of trying to justify ourselves before God, then these traditions only adds to God’s anger against sin. Read the following…

但至于我们吃什么肉，我们哪一天崇拜、祷告、守夜祷告、朝圣、传蜡烛，读弥撒等等，这些都是人的传统也应该如实的教导。不论什么时候当我们这样做是为了使我们在神面前称义，我们就是在犯罪得罪神了。请读以下经文…

![](/images/note/ags/21-3.jpg#right)

Psalm 51:16,17 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise.

诗篇 51:16,17 你本不喜爱祭物。若喜爱，我就献上。燔祭你也不喜悦。17神所要的祭，就是忧伤的灵。神阿，忧伤痛悔的心，你必不轻看。


The gospel announces to us that all our sins have been fully atoned for by Christ on Calvary. When Christ exclaimed on the cross, “It is finished,” then every vestige of our sin and guilt had been completely removed. And when God raised our Savior from the dead on Easter morning, he thereby proclaimed complete justification to the world. If anyone now tries to impose works of penance on any man as necessary in order to remove his guilt, he declares that the suffering and death of our Savior was not enough to save us.

福音告诉我们基督在骷髅地已经完全的为我们的罪献上了赎价。当基督在十架上宣告“成了”的时候，我们的罪就一点不剩的被完全抹去。当神在复活节早上把我们的救主复活的时候，他已经向整个世界宣告完全的称义。如果再有人企图说赦罪需要人的苦行，那他就是在说救主所受的苦和为我们死没有足够的能力来救我们。

#### ADIAPHORA (Formula of Concord) 可行可不行之事

The Correct, True Doctrine and Confession about this Article of faith:

关于信心之篇的正确的、真实的教义和信条：

Matthew 15:7-9 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:   “‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’”

马太福音 15：7-9 假冒为善的人哪，以赛亚指着你们说的豫言，是不错的。他说，8这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。9他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。

1. We believe, teach, and confess unanimously that the ceremonies or church usages which are neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God, but which have been introduced solely for the sake of good order and general welfare, are in and for themselves no divine worship or even a part of it.

    我们毫无疑问的相信、教导和承认神的话既没有命令也没有禁止的为了维持教会的秩序和利益而设立的教会仪式和传统本身不是对神的敬拜也不是我们应该敬拜的。

What do you think?

你有什么观点看法？

Confirmation: Divine right of the church, tradition to preserve order, or useless work that provides no lasting comfort to the sinner?

坚信礼：教会从神而来的权柄，维持秩序的传统，或不能给罪人带来长久安慰的徒劳？

Agree or disagree: We believe, teach, and confess that the community of God or the churches of God in every location and every age have the authority to change such ceremonies such as confirmation, weekly worship, holidays, Bible translations, and new settings for worship service etc., as it may be most profitable and edifying to the community or church of God.

同意或不同意：我们相信、教导和承认无论何时何地的神的教会都有权柄来修改教会仪式诸如坚信礼、每周崇拜、节假日、圣经翻译和崇拜仪式的新的安排等，这样做对神的教会最有益处。

Special Note: in the matter just previously addressed, all offenses are to be avoided and particularly for the sake of the weak in faith who are to be spared. Read the following…

特注：在刚才提到的问题中，为着保护信心软弱的人的缘故应该避免攻击冒犯。请读以下经文…

I Corinthians 8:9-13 Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. 10 For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? 11 So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. 12 When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 13 Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.

歌林多前书 8:9-13 只是你们要谨慎，恐怕你们这自由，竟成了那软弱人的绊脚石。10 若有人见你这有知识的，在偶像的庙里坐席，这人的良心若是软弱，岂不放胆去吃那祭偶像之物麽。11 因此，基督为他死的那软弱弟兄，也就因你的知识沉伦了。12 你们这样得罪弟兄们，伤了他们软弱的良心，就是得罪基督。13 所以食物若叫我弟兄跌倒，我就永远不吃肉，免得叫我弟兄跌倒了。

解决方式？

Romans 14:13-21 Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. 14 I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. 15 If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil. 17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, 18 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.  19 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. 20 Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. 21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.

罗马书 14:13-21 所以我们不可再彼此论断。宁可定意谁也不给弟兄放下绊脚人之物。14我凭着主耶稣确知深信，凡物本来没有不洁净的。惟独人以为不洁净的，在他就不洁净了。15你若因食物叫弟兄忧愁，就不是按着爱人的道理行。基督已经替他死，你不可因你的食物叫他败坏。16不可叫你的善被人毁谤。17因为神的国，不在乎吃喝，只在乎公义，和平，并圣灵中的喜乐。18在这几样上服事基督的，就为神所喜悦，又为人所称许。19所以我们务要追求和睦的事，与彼此建立德行的事。20不可因食物毁坏神的工程。凡物固然洁净，但有人因食物叫人跌倒，就是他的罪了。21无论是吃肉，是喝酒，是什么别的事，叫弟兄跌倒，一概不作才好。

Issue?

问题？

Resolution?

解决办法？

Galatians 5:1 “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”

加拉太书 5:1基督释放了我们，叫我们得自由，所以要站立得稳，不要再被奴仆的轭挟制。

II Corinthians 6:14 “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?”

哥林多后书 6:14你们和不信的原不相配，不要同负一轭。义和不义有什么相交呢。光明和黑暗有什么相通呢。

• In such matters as Christian doctrine and practice, it is no longer a case of indifference, but a matter which has to do with the truth of the Gospel, Christian liberty, as well as preventing offense to the weak in faith. In all these things we have no concessions to make, but we should witness a steadfast confession and suffer in consequence what God sends us and what he lets the enemies inflict upon us.

一些基督徒条例和惯例已经不再是可做可不做之事，而是已经关系到福音、基督徒自由还有避免信心上软弱的跌倒。在所有这些事情上我们不能退让，我们应该坚定的持守信纲，并且承受神所给我们的和神许可仇敌所给我们的一切结果。

• We also believe, teach, and confess that no church should condemn another because it has fewer or more external ceremonies not commanded by God, as long as there is mutual agreement in doctrine and in all its articles as well as in the right use of the holy sacraments.

我们也相信，教导和承认，只要教会之间在具体教义上合圣餐礼正确使用上有合一的观点，教会就不应该因为各自有不同的神没有要求的礼仪去互相指责。

Irenaeus, an early church father once put it this way, “Disagreement in fasting does not destroy agreement in faith.”

圣依仁 一个早期教会前辈曾经这样说“对禁食的观点不同不等于在信心上观点不同”。
