Our Churches, with common consent, do teach that the decree of the Council of Nicaea concerning the Unity of the Divine Essence and concerning the Three Persons, is true and to be believed without any doubting; that is to say, there is one Divine Essence which is called and which is God: eternal, without body, without parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all things, visible and invisible; and yet there are three Persons, of the same essence and power, who also are coeternal, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost. And the term “person” they use as the Fathers have used it, to signify, not a part or a quality in another, but that which subsists of itself.


我们教会一致认同，我们确实在教导尼西亚信经中有关至圣之神的一体性，以及有关三个位格（个体）的信条是真实的，是必须要无可置疑地相信的，也就是说，有一位至圣的存在，他被称为神，他也是神；他是永恒的；没有主体，没有部分；具有无限的能力、智慧以及良善；是万物的创造者和保存者；既是可见的，又是不可见的；有三个具有相同本质和能力的位格（个体），是同样永恒存在的，即圣父、圣子和圣灵。他们使用“位格（个体）person”一词，如先辈们所使用的，是用来表示一个独立的个体，它不是某个物体的一部分，或存在于另一个物质之中的物质。

The council of Nicaea: The Nicene Creed was developed, giving a concise, yet simple declaration of the God of the Bible who is revealed to us as three persons, yet one true and Holy God.

尼西亚大公会议：
产生了尼西亚信经，对圣经中向我们启示的三个位格却是一位圣洁真神的神作了言简意赅的信仰告白。

We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.

我们相信独一的上帝，全能的父，创造天地和有形无形之万物的主。                                                  

![](/images/note/ags/2-1.jpg#right) 

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father; through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became truly human. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.

我们相信独一主耶稣基督，上帝的独生子，在万世以前为父所生，出于神而为神，出于光而为光，出于真神而为真神，受生而非被造，与父一体；万物都是借着他造的。为我们，且为了拯救我们世人，他从天降临，受圣灵感孕，由童女马利亚所生，而成为真正的人；为我们的缘故在本丢彼拉多手下受难；被钉在十字架上，受死，埋葬；照圣经所说，第三天复活；升天，坐在父的右边；将来必在荣耀中再临，审判活人死人；他的国度永无穷尽；

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

我们相信圣灵，赐生命的主，从父和子出来，与父子同受敬拜，同受尊荣；他曾借众先知说话。我们相信独一神圣大公使徒的教会；我们承认使罪得赦的独一洗礼；我们盼望死人复活，并来世的生命，阿门。

It’s important to our Lutheran Heritage:
这对我们路德宗教会极其重要：

The reason we still refer to this old piece of ancient literature (325 A.D.) and confess it as an accurate description of the Triune God that Christians worship is because Lutherans wish to stress the fact that we are not separatists who have started a “new” Christian faith with Martin Luther as our follower. Our faith is not a modern day innovation. It is a faith which the church held from the beginning and for which it shed its blood from the beginning. Space and time may separate the individual Christian groups, but the communion of Saints, transcends time and space. For the Holy Christian Church is one unified church on earth and in heaven, known only to God who alone can see the heart that has faith in his Son’s work!

我们仍然提到这部古老的文献（公元后325），并承认它是基督徒所崇拜的三一神的精确描述，其原因在于：路德宗派希望借此强调——我们并不是让马丁路德作我们的跟随者而发起的一种“新的”基督信仰的分裂派，。我们的信仰并不是现代社会的创新，它是教会从起初就持守，并从起初就为之付出血的代价的一个信仰。空间和时间可以分割单个的基督徒团体，但圣徒间的契合超越时间和空间。因为基督徒圣教会在地上和天上都是一个合一的教会，只有神自己知道并看到那些对他儿子的工作有信心的心灵。

#### Who is the God of the Bible? Read the following… 圣经中的神是谁？请读下面的话：

Deuteronomy 6:4-9----4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. 5 Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. 6 These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. 7 Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 8 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 9 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.

申命记6：4-9----“以色列啊，你要听！耶和华我们神是独一的主。你要尽心、尽性、尽力爱耶和华你的神。我今日所吩咐你的话都要记在心上，也要殷勤教训你的儿女，无论你坐在家里，行在路上，躺下，起来，都要谈论；也要系在手上为记号，戴在额上为经文；又要写在你房屋的门框上，并你的城门上。”

God is One: His essence is not made up of component parts, nor are there any other gods beside him.

神只有一位：他的本质不是由组成部分构成的，除他之外也没有任何其他的神氏。

Take special note how important it was to God that his name be imprinted on the hearts of his children.

请特别留意，把神的名字印在他儿女的心版上这一点对神是何等重要。

Notice how the following New Testament passages underscore the fact that God is ONE…

注意下面新约的经文怎样强调了只有一位神的事实：

1 Corinthians 8:4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one.

林前8：4 “论到吃祭偶像之物，我们知道偶像在世上算不得什么；也知道神只有一位，再没有别的神。”

1 Corinthians 12:4-6 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.

林前12：4-6 “恩赐原有分别，圣灵却是一位；职事也有分别，主却是一位；功用也有分别，神却是一位，在众人里面运行一切的事。”

1 Timothy 2:5 who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

提前2：5 “因为只有一位神，在神和人中间，只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的基督耶稣。”2-3

![](/images/note/ags/2-3.jpg#right) 

Just as emphatic as the Bible is about the essence of God being ONE, so too, the Bible is quite emphatic about the persons of the ONE divine essence being THREE. This, we call the teaching of the Trinity – three persons, yet one God. Read the following passages…

圣经强调神的独一性的本质，同样，圣经也特别强调这位至高独一真神是三个位格的事实。这一点，我们把它称为三位一体的教义：三个个体，却还是一位神。请读下面的文字：

John 15:26 When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me.

约翰福音15：26“但我要从父那里差保惠师来，就是从父出来真理的圣灵，他来了，就要为我作见证。”

Note: when we refer to “persons” of the Trinity, we mean that which subsists of itself. For example the Son says “I,” addresses the Father as “you,” and refers to the Holy Spirit as “he.”

注：当我们提到三位一体神的“位格（个体）”时，我们指的是独为一体的个体。例如，圣子说自己为“我”，称圣父为“你”，提到圣灵时用“他”。

Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

马太福音28：19“所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。”

1. In the Great Commission of the church, shortly before Jesus ascended into heaven, he authorized believers to baptize all nations into whose name?

    耶稣在升天前不久，在教会的大使命中授权给信徒，让他们奉谁的名去给万民施洗？

2 Corinthians 13:14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

林后13：14 “愿主耶稣基督的恩惠、神的慈爱、圣灵的感动，常与你们众人同在！”

2. When the apostle Paul announced the full blessing of God to his readers, how many names does he mention for the ONE God and what are those names?

    当使徒保罗向他的读者宣告神全备的恩典时，他提到了独一神的几个名字？都是哪些？

    Matthew 3:16,17 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

    太3：16，17 “耶稣受了洗，随即从水里上来。天忽然为他开了，他就看见神的灵仿佛鸽子降下，落在他身上。从天上有声音说：‘这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。’”

3. What evidence of the Trinity do you see in this passage?

    在这段经文中，你看到三位一体的哪些证据？

    Evaluate: Skeptics of the Trinity who have denied this teaching have stated that the Old Testament has no indication of a Triune God in it. How would you defend the Trinity from the Old Testament?

    评价：批评三位一体、否认这一教义的人声称，旧约圣经中没有指出三位一体。你怎样从旧约圣经为三位一体辩护？2-4

Numbers 6:22-27
The LORD said to Moses, 23 "Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them: "'
"The LORD bless you and keep you;
the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you;
the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace." '
"So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them."

民数记6：22-27

“耶和华晓谕摩西说：‘你告诉亚伦和他儿子说：你们要这样为以色列人祝福，说：‘愿耶和华赐福给你，保护你。愿耶和华使他的脸光照你，赐恩给你。愿耶和华向你仰脸，赐你平安。’他们要如此奉我的名为以色列人祝福，我也要赐福给他们。’”

Isaiah 6:3

And they were calling to one another:
"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty;2-5
the whole earth is full of his glory."

![](/images/note/ags/2-5.jpg#right) 

赛6：3“彼此呼喊说：‘圣哉！圣哉！圣哉！万军之耶和华，他的荣光充满全地！’”

Isaiah 61:1 “The Spirit of the LORD is on me.”

赛61：1 “主耶和华的灵在我身上，”

Note: In Luke 4:16-21, Jesus tells us that this is a prophecy concerning himself and the three persons are distinctly presented. Can you see them?

No wonder the account of Creation states, “Let us make man in our image.”(Genesis 1:26)
注：在路加福音4：16-21中，耶稣告诉我们，这是有关他自己的预言，因此，三个位格（个体）便清楚地显明出来。你能看到吗？

难怪圣经在创造的记载中提到：“我们要照着我们的形像，按着我们的样式造人。”（创世纪1：26）

#### What Do the Scriptures Say about the Three Persons? 圣经有关三个位格（个体）是怎么说的？

The Bible calls the first person the Father and the second person the Son. The Son is called the “only begotten” of the Father. And even though he’s begotten from the Father, they are equally from all eternity. This is a timeless act as both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are coeternal.

圣经称第一个位格（个体）为圣父，第二个位格（个体）为圣子。圣子被称为父的“独生子”。尽管他是父的独生子，他们在永恒中是同等的，没有时间，正如父与子并圣灵是同样永恒的。

Read the following passages that describe the relationship that exists between the Father and the Son…

读下面的经文，看父与子之间存在着怎样的关系：

John 10:14,15 "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.

约10：14，15 “我是好牧人，我认识我的羊，我的羊也认识我。正如父认识我，我也认识父一样，并且我为羊舍命。”

The Father loves the Son (John 10:17), and the Son honors the Father (John 8:49). The Father sent the Son (John 12:49), and the Son returns to the Father (John 14:12). Yet the Father and the Son are one being (John 10:30). The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father (John 10:38), so that whoever sees the Son sees the Father (John 14:9).

父爱子（约10：17），而且子尊敬父（约8：49）。父差遣子（约12：49），而且子要回到父那里去（约14：12）。然而父与子是一个（约10：30）。父在子里面，子也在父里面（约10：38），使凡看见子的，就看见了父（约14：9）

The Spirit is said to proceed (sent out) from the Father (John 15:26); he is the Spirit of the Father (Matthew 10:20). Similarly he is the Spirit of the Son (Galatians 4:6). The Father sends the Spirit (Galatians 4:6), and so does the Son (John 15:26). But the Spirit is distinct in its person as well as the Father and the Son.

灵也是从父出来的（差遣）的（约15：26），他是父的灵（太10：20）。同样，他也是子的灵（加4：6）。父差遣灵（加4：6），子同样差遣灵（约15：26）。然而正如父与子是单个的个体一样，灵也是单个的个体。

![](/images/note/ags/2-6.jpg#right) 

Read the following from the account of Ananias and Sapphira…2-6 Acts 5:3-4 Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."

读下面有关亚拿尼亚和撒非喇的记载：
徒5：3-4“彼得说：‘亚拿尼亚，为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，把天地的价银私自留下几份呢？田地还没有卖，不是你自己的吗？既卖了，价银不是你做主吗？你怎么心里起这意念呢？你不是欺哄人，是欺哄神了。’”

Notice how Peter connects the Holy Spirit to God in verses 3, 4 as one in the same person.

留意彼得在第3，4节中怎样把圣灵与神作为一个个体连系在一起。

Regarding the Son, the question is frequently raised whether he is God of equal rank with the Father or whether he is subordinate to the Father. There was, indeed, a time when the Son “humbled himself” and became “obedient” to the Father, even to death on a cross (Philippians 2:8). But this very fact shows that originally he was equal with God. He is not God of second rank, but he and the Father are one.

论到子，常有问题提到他是否与父神并列，还是附属于父神。确实有一段时间，子“谦卑自己”，向父神“顺服”，以至于死，且死在十字架上（腓2：8）。然而，正是这一事实表明，他与父原本平等。他并不是次于神，而是与父原为一。

Philippians 2:5-8----Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself
and became obedient to death—even death on a cross!

![](/images/note/ags/2-7.jpg#right) 

腓力比书2：5-8----你们当以基督耶稣的心为心。他本有神的形像，不以自己与神同等为抢夺的，反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形像，成为人的样式。既有人的样子，就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上。

- Regarding the Spirit, there are two questions that are frequently asked. Is he really God, or is he perhaps the highest creature of God? This question was answered in the account of Ananias and Sapphira when Peter connected the Holy Spirit to God in the same sentence. The second question is this: Is the Spirit really a person? Critics of the Trinity suggest that he is just a “force” come forth from God. The Bible clearly teaches that he is a person, for he is coordinated with the Father and the Son at our Savior’s baptism. He is also said to have knowledge – a very deep, divine knowledge. Read the following…

- 论到圣灵，通常会问到两个问题。他真地是神吗？还是也或许是神的最高创造？这个问题在亚拿尼亚和撒非喇的记述中，由彼得在同一个句子里把圣灵和神连系起来时，就得到了解决。第二个问题是：圣灵真地是一个个体吗？批评三位一体的人认为，他只是一个由神发出的“能力”。圣经清楚地教导我们，他是一个个体，因为他在我们救主的洗礼中与父并子协同做工。他还根据圣经所说具有智慧，很深奥的属神的智慧。读下面的经文：

![](/images/note/ags/2-8.jpg#right) 

1 Corinthians 2:10,11 but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

林前2：10，11 只有神藉着圣灵向我们显明了，因为圣灵参透万事，就是神深奥的事也参透了。除了在人里头的灵，谁知道人的事？像这样，除了神的灵，也没有人知道神的事。

Conclusion: 结论：
“We worship one God in three persons and three persons in one God, without mixing the persons or dividing the divine being…yet they are not three Gods, but one God…And within this Trinity none comes before or after; none is greater or inferior, but all three persons are coequal and coeternal” (Athanasian Creed).

“我们敬拜的是有着三个位格（个体）的一位神；三个位格（个体）却是一位神，不能将三个个体混在一起，也不能将神分割开来---他们却不是三位神，而是一位---而且在这个三位一体里面，没有一个在前或在后的；也没有哪一个更大或更次，而是三个个体都是均等，都同样永恒”（亚大纳西信经）

What makes the Augsburg Confession so unique is that not only is it the primary confession of the Lutheran Church, but it was the laity (German princes) who presented this beautiful, theological confession of faith to Emperor Charles V at the Diet (meeting) of Augsburg on June 25, 1530. That date is generally considered the birth of the Lutheran church. The doctrine of Justification by grace through faith is the central theme of the entire document and fills every article of faith that is discussed.

奥格斯堡信仰纲要之所以独特的原因在于：它不仅是路德宗教会的基本纲要，还因为它是德国王室将这部优美的神学信仰纲要于1530年6月25日与会期间呈献给国王查尔斯五世的。那个日期通常被认为是路德宗教会的诞生日。靠恩典通过信心称义的教义是整个文件的中心主题，贯穿讨论中有关信心的每一个篇条。

![](/images/note/ags/1-3.jpg#center) 

Up till 1530 Luther and his followers had not really entertained the thought of separating from the Catholic Church and of forming a new distinct church body. Even in 1529, they were still a part of the body of the Roman Catholic Church and were called Protestants (protesting the Catholic faith). But when in 1530 at Augsburg they submitted a confession of their own, which was formally condemned by their Catholic opponents, a new church body was born out of necessity

直到1530年，路德和他的跟随者都还没有真正想过从天主教会分离出来、形成一个新的、不同的教会群体。即使在1529年，他们还仍然是罗马天主教会的一部分，被称为新教（意为反对天主教信仰）。但是在1530年当他们在奥格斯堡呈递了一份他们自己的信仰告白时，尽管遭到他们的天主教敌对者的正式谴责，一个新的教会应时而生。

![](/images/note/ags/1-4.jpg#center) 

But let us not forget this one thing. Luther, himself, was not a sectarian trying to gain followers for himself as though these documents were somehow “his” teachings. No, Luther and his followers tried their best to purify the church by restoring the Word of God to its highest prominence that all of doctrine would be established by the Word of God and not by man’s opinion or human tradition. Luther always prized the church as one universal body, which we confess as the “Communion of saints,” and he was very concerned about keeping that unity in the visible church as well – but not at the expense of having to compromise the truth of the Holy Bible.

但是让我们不要忘记这一点：路德本人并不是一个偏执狭隘的人，试图为自己赢得跟随者，把那些纲要看作是“自己”的教训。不是，路德和他的跟随者在尽他们最大的努力洁净教会，让神的话语恢复到它本该有的最高位置，使一切的教义都建立在神话语的基础上，而不是建立在人的意见或人类的传统上。路德一直把教会视为一个普世的整体，即我们承认的“圣徒的教会”。他也非常关心保持地上有形教会的合一，但不是以妥协圣经真理为代价。

From this study, we will see something that Jesus already told us in God’s Word when he said, 34"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn " 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law - 36a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' 37"Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:34-37).

从这个学习中，我们将会看到耶稣在神的话语中已经告诉过我们的事情。他说：“34你们不要想，我来是叫地上太平；我来并不是叫地上太平，乃是叫地上动刀兵。35因为我来是叫人与父亲生疏，女儿与母亲生疏，媳妇与婆婆生疏。36人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。37爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；”（太10：34-37）

![](/images/note/ags/1-6.jpg#center) 

With these words of our precious Savior, we are reminded that his Word will do one of two things to the people of this world – either unite us or divide us and sometimes that division goes right through the members of one’s own family.

我们的宝贵救主说的这些话提醒我们，他的话会在这个世上的人中间产生两种结果：要么将我们凝聚在一起，要么将我们分开。有时这种分裂就发生在一个人的家庭中。

As Christians grow in their faith, they will also see through this study that faith mandates a response of what we believe. It is not enough to tell someone that you believe in Jesus. For people today have made Jesus into the greatest false god by denying the plain Scriptural truths of what the Bible tells us about Jesus. Some say he’s a great prophet, but not true God; some say that he’s one of many ways into heaven, but not the only way. Anything short of what the Bible reveals to us about Jesus is idolatry. It’s important, therefore, that Christians know the Jesus of the Bible and are prepared to defend their faith according to the Bible just as the following passages remind us…

随着基督徒信心的增长，他们也将会从这个学习中看到，信心会指示我们对所信内容作出何种反应。只对别人说你相信耶稣还不够，因为现今的人否认圣经中记载的有关耶稣的真理，已经把耶稣当成了最大的假神。有人说他是一个大先知，而不是真神。有人说他是通往天国的很多方法之一，而不是唯一的方法。任何有关耶稣的说法，只要不是如圣经的启示的那样完整，就是在崇拜偶像。因此，基督徒要认识圣经中的耶稣，就像下面的经文所提醒的，我们要做好准备以圣经为根据来护卫我们的信仰，这一点很重要。

1 Peter 3:15 But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.

彼得前书3：15 只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔、敬畏的心回答个人。

1. How does a person prepare to give others answers about their faith?

    一个人当做怎样的准备来有关他们信仰的问题？

    Matthew 12:34 For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.

    太12：34 因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。

2. How do you recognize a false teacher?

    你怎样识别假教师？

3. What if a teacher of God’s Word teaches 95% of the truth, but 5% of his/her teaching is not Scriptural and false? Does the Bible consider him/her a false teacher?

    假如一个圣经教师教导的是95%的真理，而5%不是出自圣经的错误内容怎么办？圣经认为他/她是假教师吗？

    Romans 10:9,10 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.
    
    罗马书10：9，10 你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。因为人心里相信，就可以称义；口里承认，就可以得救。

4. What relationship exists between the heart that believes and the mouth that confesses?

    一颗相信的心和一张承认主名的口之间存在着怎样的关系？

    Matthew 10:32 "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.”
    太10：32 “凡在人面前认我的，我在我天父 的面前也必认他。”

5. How do Christians “acknowledge” Jesus?

    基督徒怎样“承认”耶稣？

    Luke 9:26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.

    路9：26 凡 把 我 和 我 的 道 当 作 可 耻 的 ， 人 子 在 自 己 的 荣 耀 里 ， 并 天 父 与 圣 天 使 的 荣 耀 里 降 临 的 时 候 ， 也 要 把 那 人 当 作 可 耻 的 。

6. What are the consequences of covering up known and accepted Scriptural truths that are clearly laid out for us in the Word of God?

    掩盖已经知道而且领受的、在神的话语中清楚揭示出来的圣经真理会有什么结果？

    The faith that unites Christians to their Savior also unites them with one another; as it makes them children of God, it also makes them brothers and sisters among themselves. The way in which they recognize each other is by being united in mind and thought as St. Paul teaches us in the following words…

    信心把基督徒与他们的救主联合在一起，也把他们与彼此联合在一起；信心使他们成为神的儿女，也同样在他们中间使他们成为弟兄姐妹。他们能够认出彼此是通过合一的心思也意念，正如使徒保罗在下面的经文中告诉我们的：

    1 Corinthians 1:10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.

    林前1：10 弟 兄 们 ， 我 藉 我 们 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 名 劝 你 们 都 说 一 样 的 话 。 你 们 中 间 也 不 可 分 党 ， 只 要 一 心 一 意 ， 彼 此 相 合 。

7. Why does Paul desire “perfect” unity in the body of Christ?

    保罗为什么要求在基督的身体上要达到“完美的”合一？

8. How should the body of believers reach “perfect” unity?

    信徒应该怎样达到“完美的”合一？

    Ephesians 4:14-16 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

    弗4：14—16-----14使 我 们 不 再 作 小 孩 子 ， 中 了 人 的 诡 计 和 欺 骗 的 法 术 ， 被 一 切 异 教 之 风 摇 动 ， 飘 来 飘 去 ， 就 随 从 各 样 的 异 端 ； 15惟 用 爱 心 说 诚 实 话 ， 凡 事 长 进 ， 连 於 元 首 基 督 ， 16全 身 都 靠 他 联 络 得 合 式 ， 百 节 各 按 各 职 ， 照 着 各 体 的 功 用 彼 此 相 助 ， 便 叫 身 体 渐 渐 增 长 ， 在 爱 中 建 立 自 己 。

9. How does Paul teach us in this passage that the idea of “agreeing to disagree” is a dangerous way of life inside of the Christian faith?

    保罗为什么在这段经文中告诉我们说，“同意有不同”在基督信仰内部是一种危险的生活方式？

The Christian’s common confession of faith binds them together, but at the same time separates1-12 them from unbelievers and false teachers. This, too, is extremely important lest the child of faith become confused and disbelieving because of heretics. Listen to the following words of Scripture…

基督徒共同的信仰宣言将他们连为一体，但同时也把他们与不信的人和假教师分开。这一点对于基督徒来说也极其重要，免得因为异教徒而受迷惑以致不信。听下面的圣经话语：

Romans 16:17 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.

罗16：17 弟 兄 们 ， 那 些 离 间 你 们 、 叫 你 们 跌 倒 、 背 乎 所 学 之 道 的 人 ， 我 劝 你 们 要 留 意 躲 避 他 们 。

Matthew 7:15,16 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them.

太7：15-16 你 们 要 防 备 假 先 知 。 他 们 到 你 们 这 里 来 ， 外 面 披 着 羊 皮 ， 里 面 却 是 残 暴 的 狼 。 16凭 着 他 们 的 果 子 ， 就 可 以 认 出 他 们 来 。 荆 棘 上 岂 能 摘 葡 萄 呢 ？ 蒺 藜 里 岂 能 摘 无 花 果 呢 ？

God’s desire for us in his Word is to strengthen the unity that exists in the body of Christ by growing in his Word together. Any compromise of the Word of God is a denial of the truth and will ultimately lead to greater denials in the end. Read the following…

在神的话语中，他期望我们能通过在他话语上的不断一起长进，来加强存在于基督身体中的合一。任何对神话语的妥协都是对真理的否认，而且最终造成末后更大的否认。读下面的经文：

Ephesians 4:3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

弗4：3 用 和 平 彼 此 联 络 ， 竭 力 保 守 圣 灵 所 赐 合 而 为 一 的 心 。

Hebrews 10:25 Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

来10：25 你 们 不 可 停 止 聚 会 ， 好 像 那 些 停 止 惯 了 的 人 ， 倒 要 彼 此 劝 勉 ， 既 知 道 （ 原 文 是 看 见 ） 那 日 子 临 近 ， 就 更 当 如 此 。

2 Timothy 1:8 So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.

提后 1：8 你 不 要 以 给 我 们 的 主 作 见 证 为 耻 ， 也 不 要 以 我 这 为 主 被 囚 的 为 耻 ； 总 要 按 神 的 能 力 ， 与 我 为 福 音 同 受 苦 难 。

In studying the several articles of the Augsburg Confession, we shall see how they serve a double purpose.

藉着对奥格斯堡信仰纲要其中几个信条的学习，我们将看到它们在怎样起着双重的作用：

1) Uniting us in the true faith, founded on God’s Word alone and confessed by Christians of all ages.

1）让基督徒在真正的信仰中联合。这信仰是单单建立在神的话语上，且被历史历代的基督徒所公认的。

2) Saving us from an unhealthy unionism with “Christians” who aren’t interested in what the Word of truth says, but rather interested in a generic Christianity that really stands for nothing.

2）把我们从一种与不健康的 “基督徒们”的联合中拯救出来，他们对神话语中的真理不感兴趣，只对没有任何意义的基督教感兴趣。

May God richly bless our study of the Augsburg Confession as we study the following articles of the Christian faith…
