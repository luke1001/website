Also they teach that at the Consummation of the World Christ will appear for judgment, and will raise up all the dead; He will give to the godly and elect eternal life and everlasting joys, but ungodly men and the devils He will condemn to be tormented without end. They condemn the Anabaptists, who think that there will be an end to the punishments of condemned men and devils. They condemn also others, who are now spreading certain Jewish opinions, that before the resurrection of the dead the godly shall take possession of the kingdom of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed.

他们又教导人：当世界末期（在末日），基督再要显现，施行审判，叫一切死人复活，赐永生永福给敬虔被拣选的人，但不敬畏神的人和魔鬼将受永远的刑罚。我们教会弃绝重洗派，他们认为被定罪的恶人和魔鬼所受的刑罚有一天会结束。又弃绝那些散布犹大人意见的，说死人复活之先，敬畏神的人要占领世界的国，各地的恶人要被征服。

Three chief points will be discussed in today’s lesson:

· Christ’s return on the Last Day

· The resurrection of the dead

· The eternal fate of both the godly and the ungodly

今天的课程里我们要讨论三个要点:

· 末日基督的再临

· 死人的复活

· 选民与外邦人的永恒结局

In addition to this subject, we will also discuss some errors in regards to these topics that are rejected by us.

另外, 我们也将讨论关于这个题目的已经被我们否定过的一些谬误。

**I.  “...at the Consummation of the World Christ will appear...” “...在世界的末了基督将要显现...”**

Can you think of a time when this truth was plainly announced? (Acts 1:11)

你能记起在什么时候宣讲这个真理的吗？(使徒行传 1:11)

When the Bible presents our Lord’s return like a “thief in the night,” what point of comparison are we to draw?

当圣经描述主的再临像是 “盗贼在夜间偷偷来到,”这个比喻是要向我们说明什么?

a．Jesus will come so quietly that nobody will detect his return for judgment.

耶稣的再来是如此的安静以至于没人察觉到他将要归来审判这世界。

b. Jesus wants us to always be prepared for his return because we never know when he will return.

耶稣想要我们保持警醒，为他的再临做好准备，因为我们永远不知道他何时再来。

Jesus, himself, spoke plainly about his visible return in the following passages:

耶稣自己也在以下经文中直接讲述了人眼可见的人子再临的场景：

Matthew 24:30 Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.

马太福音 24:30那时，人子的兆头要显在天上，地上的万族都要哀哭。他们要看见人子，有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。

1) Who will witness this?

1) 谁将见证这些?

Luke 17:24 For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.

路加福音 17:24 因为人子在他降临的日子，好像闪电，从天这边一闪，直照到天那边。

2）Who does the lightening represent?

2) 闪电代表谁?

3）In Paul’s letters that he wrote toward the end of his life, he mentions the return of Christ as a very important event. Do you remember what he said would happen to the Antichrist “by the splendor of his coming?”

3) 在保罗的书信里他写到了关于自己生命的末了，他将基督的再临看的非常重要。你是否还记得他说过那些敌基督的将要“在基督的荣光降临”时发生什么事吗？

II Thessalonians 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.

帖撒罗尼迦后书 2:8那时这不法的人，必显露出来。主耶稣要用口中的气灭绝他，用降临的荣光废掉他。

Paul describes the present life of a Christian as a waiting “for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13).

保罗描述基督徒今世的生命就像等待 “等候所盼望的福，并等候至大的神，和（或作无和字）我们救主耶稣基督的荣耀显现。” (提多书 2:13).

4）What is the purpose of Christ’s return?

4) 基督再临的目的是什么?

Our article answers this question by saying, Christ will appear for judgment. It will be the final judgment which will decide the fate of every person for all eternity.

我们的标题回答了这个问题说：基督显现为要审判众人。而这将是决定每个人永恒命运的最终的审判。

5）If we say that Christ’s return is for final judgment, can it also be said that the Christian has many judgments throughout his/her lifetime and that the final one is a finality to all of them?

5) 如果说基督的再临是为了最终的审判, 可不可以这样说，就是基督徒一生之中有很多的审判而最终的审判就正是所有这些审判的最终总结?

Consider the judgment that Jesus speaks of in the gospel of St. John…

考虑一下圣约翰的福音书里耶稣说到的审判……

John 3:19 “This is the verdict (literally, the judgment): Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light.”

约翰福音 3:19 “光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗，定他们的罪就是在此。 ”

John 9:39 “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”

约翰福音 9:39 “耶稣说，我为审判到这世上来，叫不能看见的，可以看见。能看见的，反瞎了眼。”

6）What judgment is being spoken of by Jesus?

6) 耶稣宣布了些什么样的审判?

The Bible also speaks of a variety of judgments that are imposed upon the church (body of believers) with the intention of preserving Christians from falling into eternal damnation together with the unbelieving world. Both Peter and Paul talk about it. Read the following…

圣经也提到了临到教会的种种审判，为了使基督徒们不要与不信的人一起进入永远的刑罚。彼得和保罗都谈到了这件事. 看下面的经文…

I Peter 4:15-19 “If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, ‘If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?’ So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.”

彼得前书 4:15-19 “你们中间却不可有人，因为杀人，偷窃，作恶，好管闲事而受苦。若为作基督徒受苦，却不要羞耻。倒要因这名归荣耀给神。因为时候到了，审判要从神的家起首。若是先从我们起首，那不信从神福音的人，将有何等的结局呢。若是义人仅仅得救，那不虔敬和犯罪的人，将有何地可站呢。所以那照神旨意受苦的人，要一心为善，将自己灵魂交与那信实的造化之主。”

7）How was this “judgment” seen as something positive for the child of God?

7)对于上帝的儿女来说，应该怎样积极的来看“审判”?

I Corinthians 11:29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.

哥林多前书 11:29 因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。

8）How could this sort of judgment bring about anything positive for the body of Christ?

8) 对于基督的肢体来说这种审判带来哪些积极的意义?

Continue reading Paul’s words to the Corinthians…

继续阅读保罗写给哥林多教会的话…

I Corinthians 11:30-32 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.

哥林多前书 11:30-32 因此，在你们中间有好些软弱的，与患病的，死的也不少（死原文作睡）。我们若是先分辨自己，就不至于受审。我们受审的时候，乃是被主惩治。免得我们和世人一同定罪。

• As God’s children, we ought to take warning to these judgments of our Lord. They are warnings from God to keep us on the straight and narrow path. But when Jesus shall return from heaven for judgment, that will be the final judgment, deciding our fate forever.

作为神的儿女, 我们应该对主的审判警醒。 因为这些来自于神的警告是为了让我们能够继续认定标杆走窄路。但是当主耶稣再次从天降下来审判世界的时候，那将是最终的审判，将决定我们永恒的命运。

Let us take a vivid look at a picture of that judgment given us by Christ himself.

让我们来看看主耶稣自己给我们讲述的关于对我们的审判的生动画面。

Matthew 25:31-46
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’  37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ 40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’  41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’  44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’ 45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ 46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”

马太福音 25:31-46----“31当人子在他荣耀里同着众天使降临的时候，要坐在他荣耀的宝座上。 32 万民都要聚集在他面前。他要把他们分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊山羊一般。 33 把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。 34 于是王要向那右边的说，你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。 35 因为我饿了，你们给我吃。渴了，你们给我喝。我作客旅，你们留我住。 36 我赤身露体，你们给我穿。我病了，你们看顾我。我在监里，你们来看我。 37 义人就回答说，主阿，我们什么时候见你饿了给你吃，渴了给你喝。 38 什么时候见你作客旅留你住，或是赤身露体给你穿。 39 又什么时候见你病了，或是在监里，来看你呢。 40 王要回答说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。 41 王又要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去。 42 因为我饿了，你们不给我吃。渴了，你们不给我喝。 43 我作客旅，你们不留我住。我赤身露体，你们不给我穿。我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。 44 他们也要回答说，主阿，我们什么时候见你饿了，或渴了，或作客旅，或赤身露体，或病了，或在监里，不伺候你呢。 45 王要回答说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不作在我身上了。 46 这些人要往永刑里去。那些义人要往永生里去。”

9）What will be the two-fold verdict of our Lord on that great day of Judgment?

9) 最终审判日的时候神会给出哪两种判决?

Paul calls this judgment “the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed” (Ro. 2:5).

保罗称最终审判是 “神震怒，显祂公义审判的日子来到” (罗马书 2:5).

10）As Christians, are we to fear this day or does the Bible tell us to look forward to that day with joy?

10) 作为基督徒，我们应该惧怕这一日还是像圣经说的怀着喜乐的心盼望那一日的到来?

I John 4:16,17 God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.

约翰一书 4:16,17神爱我们的心，我们也知道也信。神就是爱。住在爱里面的，就住在神里面，神也住在他里面。 17 这样爱在我们里面得以完全，我们就可以在审判的日子，坦然无惧。因为他如何，我们在这世上也如何。

On the other hand, they that reject the Savior have a “fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire”, because they will be shown “judgment without mercy”. Read the following…

另一方面, 那些拒绝基督救恩的人“惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众人的烈火”, 因为他们将会得到 “无怜悯的审判”。看下面的经文…

Hebrews 10:26,27 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 27 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.

希伯来书 10:26,27 因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了。27 惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众人的烈火。

James 2:12,13 Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, 13 because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

雅各书 2:12,13 你们既然要按使人自由的律法受审判，就该照这律法说话行事。13 因为那不怜悯人的，也要受无怜悯的审判。怜悯原是向审判夸胜。

One thing that every person born into this world can count on is this: we shall all have to appear in this final judgment; no one will be overlooked, and no one will escape. “Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment” (Hebrews 9:27).

Judgment Day - The Final Act of Christ’s great work of redemption!

我们生在这世上有一件事是可以确定的: 我们所有人都将站在最终的审判台前;没有人会被漏掉，也没有人可以逃避。 “按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。” (希伯来书 9:27).

最终审判日 – 基督伟大救赎的大结局!

![](/images/note/ags/23-5.jpg#right)

John 5:22,27 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, 27 And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.

约翰福音 5:22,27 

22 父不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子, 

27 并且因为他是人子，就赐给他行审判的权柄。

11）Why was this great work of Judgment entrusted to the Son of Man?

11) 为什么最终审判的伟大工作托付给了人子耶稣?

I Corinthians 15:24-28 Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death. 27 For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. 28 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.

哥林多前书 15:24-28 再后末期到了，那时，基督既将一切执政的，掌权的，有能的，都毁灭了，就把国交与父神。25 因为基督必要作王，等神把一切仇敌，都放在他的脚下。26 尽末了所毁灭的仇敌，就是死。27 因为经上说，神叫万物都服在他的脚下。既说万物都服了他，明显那叫万物服他的不在其内了。28 万物既服了他，那时，子也要自己服那叫万物服他的，叫神在万物之上，为万物之主。

How are we to understand these verses in light of Paul’s words to the Romans, which say, “If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection” (Romans 6:5)

根据保罗写给罗马的话我们应该怎样理解如下经文 “我们若在他死的形状上与他联合，也要在他复活的形状上与他联合。” (罗马书 6:5)

“Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him” (Romans 6:8-9).

“我们若是与基督同死，就信必与他同活。因为知道基督既从死里复活，就不再死，死也不再作他的主了” (罗马书 6:8-9).

“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:38-39).

“因为我深信无论是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝。这爱是在我们的主基督里的” (罗马书 8:38-39).

And Jesus says in Revelation 2:11 “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.”

而耶稣也讲到 启示录 2:11 “圣灵向众教会所说的话，凡有耳的，就应当听。得胜的，必不受第二次死的害。”

Revelation 20:14 And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.

启示录 20:14 死亡和阴间也被扔在火湖里。这火湖就是第二次的死。

Here we have, perhaps some unanswered questions that will remain such until the end. What happens at the moment of death? The Bible makes it clear to us that the body rests in the ground while the soul returns to God who gave it. And in the instance of the believer, that soul rests with God awaiting the resurrection of the dead. But what about the unbeliever’s soul? For sure, the souls of unbelievers exist in a state of death (not to be confused with mortality of the soul), that is, a separation from the blessings of God; and souls of believers continue to exist in a state of life, that is, of enjoyment of the blessings of God.

现在，我们可能在结束之前心里仍有些未解之疑问。 人死的那一刻发生了什么事? 圣经很清楚的告诉了我们那时肉体仍要留在地上而灵将要归回赐生命的神。对于信徒来说，灵魂将会安息主怀直到复活的时候。但是不信者的灵魂呢? 可以肯定的说, 不信者的灵仍会处于死亡状态中(不要误认为灵魂会死), 那里是与神的恩典与祝福隔离的；而信徒的灵魂将住在乐园里, 在那里有上帝的恩典与祝福。

With this understanding, the Lake of fire referred to in Revelation 20:14, is the second death. The first death is the physical, or bodily, death - the separation from the physical and temporal blessings of God that normally comes to all men, believers and unbelievers alike. The second death is the eternal separation from God in the torment of hell body + soul.

带着这种理解, 启示录20章14节提到的火湖, 是第二次的死亡。第一次的死是有形的，或身体的死，对于信与不信的人来说，都要面对这一次与暂时和有形的神的祝福的隔绝。而第二次的死是灵魂与身体在地狱中受苦并与神永远的隔绝。

At Judgment Day, after Christ has “put all his enemies under his feet” (I Cor. 15:25), and his work of redemption has then been fully completed, This final Judgment executed upon the whole world will be the crowning act of his glory.

在最终审判日, 在基督 “神把一切仇敌，都放在他的脚下”之后 (哥林多前书 15:25), 当祂救赎的工作最终完成之后, 对这个世界的最终审判将成为神的大荣耀。

There is only one way to prepare for this great day: believe in Jesus as our Savior from sin. While it is true that we as Christians are commanded by Christ to take up our cross and follow after him, we must recognize that we can only do so in light of trusting in him to save us. Perhaps the best advice given on this issue from former theologians was that we should not argue about what kind of fire it will be but zealously seek to make sure that we will never find out from experience. This is one of the “open questions” about which Christian theologians ought not to quarrel.

只有一种途径去准备面对那一日:相信耶稣基督能将我们从罪中救赎，作为基督徒我们有基督的命令要我们背起自己的十字架跟随主，我们必须认识到我们能如此行是因为相信主必要救我们。 也许之前的神学家们给出的对于这个问题的最好建议就是我们不要去想办法探讨那永火的地狱将是怎样的刑罚而是将精力放在寻求怎样使我们永远不必受这样的刑罚。这是基督教神学家们之间不应该争论的 “开放式问题”之一。

And what are we to do as the signs of his return become more and more evident? We are to cheerfully do as Jesus told us: “Stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near” (Luke 21:28). That will be as our article calls it, the Consummation of the World.

当主再来的征兆越来越明显时我们应当怎样作? 我们应当欢喜快乐的作耶稣所告诉我们的: “一有这些事，你们就当挺身昂首。因为你们得赎的日子近了” (路加福音 21:28). 这就是我们的文章所说的末世, 天国的降临。
