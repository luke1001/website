Introduction: 

简介：

For many centuries now, including today, popes have claimed supremecy over both the church and the state and they have not revoked these claims to present day. The Roman Church may say otherwise if it suites their purpose, but whenever it feels strong enough to carry out its designs, it will insist on absolute supremecy. In 1946, they were able to successfully keep Protestant missionaries out of South America.

几个世纪以来包括今天教皇宣称对教会和国家拥有至高无上的权力直到今日他们也没有改变这种说法。罗马天主教会根据需要换个说法但是在必要的时候他们还会坚持自己至高无上的权力。在1946年他们成功的把新教传教士拒之南非门外。

Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085) formulated his ideas in a document which is known as Kictatus Papae. It itemizes 27 different claims. Here are just a few of those claims: (3) He (the pope) alone can depose bishops or reinstate them. (6) With persons excommunicated by him we may not, among other things, remain in the same house. (19) He may be judged by no man. (21) The more important cases from every church must be referred to him. (22) The Roman Church never erred, and according to the testimony of the Scriptures it will never err. (12) It is within his province to depose emperors. (27) He may absolve subjects of their oath of allegiance to wicked rulers.

教皇格雷戈里七世（1073-1085）将自己的观点形成文子也就是《教皇敕令》。它罗列了27项主张。其中一些如下：（3）他（教皇）可以罢免主教或使主教恢复原职。（6）被驱逐出教的人，我们不能与他一同在一个屋檐下共处任何事情。（19）没有人能评判他。（21）教会中所有重要事情必须提交教皇。（22）罗马教会从没有错过，根据圣经它也不会犯错。（12）他可以罢免皇帝。（27）他可以使人从对邪恶统治者的效忠誓言中解脱。

If we keep these claims of the Roman Church in mind, then we shall be in a better position to appreciate the truth confessed by our Augsburg fathers in Article XXVIII.

如果我们牢记罗马教会这些主张就会更加欣赏我们的前辈在二十八篇中教导的真理。


I. The Difference between Spiritual and Secular Authority 

属世和属灵权力的区别

There has been great controversy concerning the Power of Bishops, in which some have awkwardly confounded the power of the Church and the power of the sword. And from this confusion very great wars and tumults have resulted, while the Pontiffs, emboldened by the power of the Keys, not only have instituted new services and burdened consciences with reservation of cases and ruthless excommunications, but have also undertaken to transfer the kingdoms of this world,  and to take the Empire from the Emperor. These wrongs have long since been rebuked in the Church  by learned and godly men. Therefore our teachers, for the comforting of men's consciences, were constrained to show the difference between the power of the Church and the power of the sword, and taught that both of them, because of God's commandment, are to be held in reverence and honor, as the chief blessings of God on earth.

关于主教的权力向来争议很大，有些人竟把教会的权力和国家的权力混为一谈。正是因为这种混淆带来了战争和骚乱，然而教皇自恃钥匙的权力，不仅杜撰很多新的服侍方式而且通过保留个案和无情的驱逐出教让良心不安，教皇还以世界上的国家为己任还有权力驱逐国王。这些错误长期来一直受有见识之人和正义之士批判。因此我们的老师为使良心得安慰而义不容辞的来区分教会的权力和国家的权力，他们认为两者都出于神都应该看为神在地上的主要而受到尊重。

Notes:

注：

In the beginning of church history, the church held only spiritual authority and never secular authority, that is authority in the government. Read the following…

在早期教会教会只有属灵的权力而没有属世的权力，也就是政府的权力。请读以下经文…

Acts 20:28 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.

使徒行传 20:28 圣灵立你们作全群的监督，你们就当为自己谨慎，也为全群谨慎，牧养神的教会，就是他用自己血所买来的。（或作救赎）

Twice in the letters of St. Paul, written to fellow pastors, he listed qualifications required in a bishop (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9), but in neither instance does the bishop appear to be a secular prince administrating affairs over the state. He is assigned purely spiritual work to which he is to apply himself and strictly confine himself.

保罗曾两次在他写给同工牧师的信中提到执事的资格（提摩太前书3:1-7：提多书1:5-9）但在这两处执事看起来都不像一个管理国家事务的属世君王。执事只是被赋予属灵的工作，他要做这样的工作并要有严格的限制。

But this is their opinion, that the power of the Keys, or the power of the bishops, according to the Gospel, is a power or commandment of God, to preach the Gospel, to remit and retain sins, and to administer Sacraments.  For with this commandment Christ sends forth His Apostles, John 20:21 sqq.: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. Receive ye the Holy Spirit. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.  Mark 16:15: Go preach the Gospel to every creature.

他们的看法是这样的：根据所传的福音钥匙的权力或者说执事的权力是神的命令或能力，是要传讲福音或赦罪或定罪并且要施行圣礼。因为基督这样命令他的使徒，约翰福音20:21父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。你们受圣灵。你们赦免谁的罪，谁的罪就赦免了。你们留下谁的罪，谁的罪就留下了。马可福音16:15：你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听。

Notes:

注：

To administer the keys is the office of the bishops. This is the power which was conferred on them by their call. This is the only power which Jesus conferred on his church, and this is the only power which the church, in turn, can confer on its ministers for public administration.

钥匙的事工是主教的职责。这是他们的呼召所赋予他们的权力。这是耶稣给教会的唯一权力也是教会能祝福神职人员的唯一权力。

This power, as our Article describes it, embraces particularly three main functions. The first is to preach the Gospel, the wonderful message of salvation through Jesus, in every way possible. The second is to remit and retain sins, that is, to instruct, to warn, and to admonish individuals; to comfort them when they repent; or, in the name of God, to announce to them God’s judgment of eternal damnation if they refuse to repent. The third is to administer Sacraments, to prepare people for Baptism by a proper course of instruction and to assist them in every way possible that they may partake of the Lord’s Supper worthily.

我们本篇认为这种权力主要有三种作用。第一个就是尽一切可能传福音，也就是藉耶得救的大好信息。第二个就是赦免或定罪，也就是教导、警告和劝诫人，安慰悔改的人；或奉主的名向拒不悔改的人宣告神的永远的刑罚。第三个就是施圣礼，即以一定的教导来预备人领圣餐和尽可能帮助人以敬畏的心来领受圣餐。

For carrying out this commission, Jesus equipped his apostles, not with police power and a sword, nor with legislative authority, but with the Holy Spirit, the same Holy Spirit with which he himself was anointed for his office, “The Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD” (Isaiah 11:2).

为了更好的行使这个使命耶稣没有用警察武装和刀剑或立法权来装备他的门徒，而是用圣灵也就是膏抹耶稣开始他的事工的同一位圣灵，“就是使他有智慧和聪明的灵，谋略和能力的灵，知识和敬畏耶和华的灵。”（以赛亚书11:2）

This power is exercised only by teaching or preaching the Gospel and administering the Sacraments, according to their calling either to many or to individuals. For thereby are granted, not bodily, but eternal things, as eternal righteousness, the Holy Ghost, eternal life.  These things cannot come but by the ministry of the Word and the Sacraments, as Paul says, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.  Therefore, since the power of the Church grants eternal things, and is exercised only by the ministry of the Word, it does not interfere with civil government; no more than the art of singing interferes with civil government.  For civil government deals with other things than does the Gospel. The civil rulers defend not minds, but bodies and bodily things against manifest injuries, and restrain men with the sword and bodily punishments in order to preserve civil justice and peace.

这种权力只限于根据各人呼召想个人或群众传讲福音和施圣礼。因此所赐下的应许不过关乎肉体的乃是关乎永生的，如永远的义、圣灵和永生。所有这些来自神的话和圣礼，正如保罗所说，罗马书1:16：这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的。因此教会的权力带来的应许是关乎永生的，是单单依照神的话。教会的权力跟政府互不影响，还没有歌唱艺术带给政府的影响大。因为政府主要是处理福音以外的事情。非宗教的掌权者保护的不是思想而是身体或有形体的东西不受侵害，用刀剑和刑罚来约束人来保证公正和安定。

Notes:

注：

Here, the Lutheran fathers state very clearly and precisely the difference between ecclesiastical and secular power, both as to the purpose which they serve and the means which they employ in accordance with their purpose. Ecclesiastical power dispenses eternal things, while secular power dispenses temporal things.

在此路德宗前辈非常清楚的区分了教会权力和属世权力，包括区分它们的用途和根据用途而来的使用途径。教会权力处理关乎永远的事情而属世权力处理的是暂时的事情。

The means which secular powers employ to achieve their purpose are therefore altogether different from the means employed by the church. They are the sword, both to protect, and to punish. The church, however, uses the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God to call to repentance or to comfort and console guilty consciences.

属世权力行使的方式完全不同于教会权力的行使方式。前者是用刀剑来保护或惩罚。教会是用圣灵的宝剑和神的话来劝人悔改和使悔罪的心得到安慰。

II. Now the article talks about the danger of confusing the roles of church with the government as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly guilty of during this time-period. 

本篇接下来谈论把教会和政府混为一谈的危险性，这也正是罗马天主教在这一时期所犯的错误。

Therefore the power of the Church and the civil power must not be confounded. The power of the Church has its own commission to teach the Gospel and  to administer the Sacraments. Let it not break into the office of another; let it not transfer the kingdoms of this world; let it not abrogate the laws of civil rulers; let it not abolish lawful obedience; let it not interfere with judgments concerning civil ordinances or contracts; let it not prescribe laws to civil rulers concerning the form of the Commonwealth.  As Christ says, John 18:36: My kingdom is not of this world;  alsoLuke 12:14: Who made Me a judge or a divider over you?  Paul also says, Phil. 3:20: Our citizenship is in heaven; 2 Cor. 10:4: The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the casting down of imaginations.

因此教会权力和政府权力不能搅在一起。教会权力是为了去传讲福音和施行圣礼。不要让它干涉政府权力；不要让它改变这世界的国度；不要让它去废除掌权者的法律；不要让它破坏对法律的遵守；不要让它干预民事审判；不要让它参政议政；正如基督所说，约翰福音18:36我的国不属这世界。同时路加福音12:14谁立我作你们断事的官，给你们分家业呢。保罗也说，腓3:20我们却是天上的国民；林后10:4我们争战的兵器，本不是属血气的，乃是在神面前有能力可以攻破坚固的营垒。

Notes:

注：

Simply put, Christ commanded the church to preach the gospel, not wield the sword of the state! The Lutheran church fathers then back up their position with several passages from Scripture that confirm their stance on the separation of the two powers.

简单来说，基督是要教会传福音而不是拥有政权！路德宗前辈们然后用几段经文来支持和明确他们在政教分离上的立场。

After this manner our teachers discriminate between the duties of both these powers, and command that both be honored and acknowledged as gifts and blessings of God.

此后我们的老师又对两者的职责予以区别并且要求我们二者都要尊重和承认，二者都是神的恩赐和祝福。

If bishops have any power of the sword, that power they have, not as bishops, by the commission of the Gospel, but by human law having received it of kings and emperors for the civil administration of what is theirs. This, however, is another office than the ministry of the Gospel.

如果主教教拥有政权，这并不是福音所赋予的权力，而是为了管理国王或皇帝的国家而依照法律从他们获得的权力。然而，这是不同于福音事工的。

III. When, therefore, the question is concerning the jurisdiction of bishops, civil authority must be distinguished from ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Again, according to the Gospel or, as they say, by divine right, there belongs to the bishops as bishops, that is, to those to whom has been committed the ministry of the Word and the Sacraments, no jurisdiction except to forgive sins, to judge doctrine, to reject doctrines contrary to the Gospel, and to exclude from the communion of the Church wicked men, whose wickedness is known, and this without human force,  simply by the Word. Herein the congregations of necessity and by divine right must obey them, according to Luke 10:16: He that heareth you heareth Me.  

关于主教审判权的问题，要区分政府权力和教会审判权。根据福音或神所赐的权力，主教只能做主教的事。主教是要做传讲神的话和施行圣礼，除了赦罪，决定教义，抵制违背福音教义，驱逐臭名昭著的恶人出教—不是出于武力乃是因着道—外主教不应该有审判权。在这些事上会众必须舒服他们因他们有来自神的权力，根据路加福音10:16听从你们的就是听从我。

Notes:

注：

Our article stresses four points: 1) the jurisdiction of Bishops to forgive sins. Having the ministry of the Word, they are to 2) judge doctrine and 3) reject doctrines that are contrary to the gospel.

我们的文章强调四点：1）主教赦罪的审判权。他们的事工在乎道，他们要2）判断教义对错3）抵制违背福音的教义

Many people today are of the opinion that creeds don’t matter, but only deeds of the individual person. But is this consistent with what Jesus and the apostles taught us? Read the following…

今天很多人认为信条不重要重，重要的是人的行为。但这符合耶稣和使徒的教导吗？请读以下经文…

2 Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.

提摩太后书 4:3 因为时候要到，人必厌烦纯正的道理。耳朵发痒，就随从自己的情欲，增添好些师傅。

Titus 2:1 You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.

提多书 2:1 但你所讲的，总要合乎那纯正的道理。

1 Timothy 4:6 If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.

提摩太前书4:6 你若将这些事提醒弟兄们，便是基督耶稣的好执事，在真道的话语，和你向来所服从的善道上，得了教育。

1 Timothy 6:3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, they are conceited and understand nothing.

提摩太前书 6:3 若有人传异教，不服从我们主耶稣基督纯正的话，与那合乎敬虔的道理。

Acts 20:30 Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.

使徒行传 20:30 就是你们中间，也必有人起来，说悖谬的话，要引诱门徒跟从他们。

Ephesians 4:14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.

以弗所书 4:14 使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计，和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，飘来飘去，就随从各样的异端。

Hebrews 13:9 Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings.

希伯来书 13:9 你们不要被那诸般怪异的教训勾引了去。

It is one of the primary duties of the ministers of a church to watch over the doctrine, that the people are nourished with sound and wholesome doctrine, and that strange and perverse doctrines are rejected.

教会牧师的基本职责是要看守真道，确保人们受到纯正和有造就性的真道的教导并要抵制歪谬的学说。

Finally, as ministers of the Word 4) they are to exclude from the communion of the Church wicked men. Jesus himself instructed his church to consider a sinning brother who refuses to repent to be “treated as a pagan or a tax collector” (Matthew 18:17). St. Paul chides the Corinthians for having failed to deal properly with a sinner in their midst (1 Corinthians 5). If a public offense is tolerated by the church, a little yeast will soon work through the whole batch of dough. No human force is to be brought on the excommunicated, but rather only the Sword of the Spirit that shuts the doors of heaven to the impenitent.

最后作为神话语的服侍者4）他们还要赶出他们中间的恶人。耶稣教导教会对待拒不悔改的犯罪的弟兄要“就看他像外邦人和税吏一样”（马太福音18:17）。圣保罗为着格林多教会没有正确对付他们中间的罪人而责备他们（哥林多前书5）。如果纵容公开犯罪那么一点酵可以使整团面发起来。对被赶出的人使用的不是血气而是给拒不悔改之人关上天国之门的圣灵宝剑。

When the bishops handle these matters according to the Word of God, then they are functioning as bishops, and the Christians owe them obedience by divine right. If they act contrary to the Word of God, then the Christians are duty bound to refuse obedience.

当主教们照神的话管理这些事情的时候他们就是在尽本分，基督徒应该依照神的命令顺服他们。如果他们所做的违背神的话基督徒应该义不容辞的拒绝顺服。

But when they teach or ordain anything against the Gospel, then the congregations have a commandment of God prohibiting obedience, Matt. 7:15: Beware of false prophets;  Gal. 1:8: Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed;  2 Cor. 13:8: We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.  Also: The power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.  So, also, the Canonical Laws command (II. Q. VII. Cap., Sacerdotes, and Cap. Oves).  And Augustine (Contra Petiliani Epistolam): Neither must we submit to Catholic bishops if they chance to err, or hold anything contrary to the Canonical Scriptures of God.

如果他们的教导或任命是违背福音的那么会众就应该听神的命令而不去顺服。太7:15：你们要防备假先知；加1:8是天上来的使者，若传福音给你们，与我们所传给你们的不同，他就应当被咒诅。林后13:8我们凡事不能敌挡真理，只能扶助真理。并且：这权柄原是为造就人，并不是为败坏人。另外教会法也有这样的规定(II. Q. VII. Cap., Sacerdotes, and Cap. Oves)。奥古斯丁(Contra Petiliani
Epistolam)：如果主教犯错或与圣经相违背我们就没必要顺服他们。

If they have any other power or jurisdiction, in hearing and judging certain cases, as of matrimony or of tithes, etc., they have it by human right, in which matters princes are bound, even against their will, when the ordinaries fail, to dispense justice to their subjects for the maintenance of peace.  

如果他们还有其它的权力或审判权，包括听取和审批某些案件，比如婚姻类或十一奉献类的等等，他们做这样的事是来自人的权力，这些事情本来是王的事情，是为了维持和平安定而给有需要的平民百姓以公义。

IV. Moreover, it is disputed whether bishops or pastors have the right to introduce ceremonies in the Church, and to make laws concerning meats, holy-days and grades, that is, orders of ministers, etc.  They that give this right to the bishops refer to this testimony John 16:12-13: I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.  They also refer to the example of the Apostles, who commanded to abstain from blood and from things strangled, Acts 15:29.  They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems. Neither is there any example whereof they make more than concerning the changing of the Sabbath-day. Great, say they, is the power of the Church, since it has dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments!

此外在主教或牧师有没有权力增加教会礼仪，制定有关肉、圣日和等级也就是服侍人员的等级等这一问题上有一定的争议。把这种权力赐给主教的人以这段圣经为依据约翰福音16:12-13：我还有好些事要告诉你们，但你们现在担当不了（或作不能领会）。只等真理的圣灵来了，他要引导你们明白（原文作进入）一切的真理。他们还以使徒为例，使徒们禁戒血和勒死的牲畜，使徒行传15:29.他们指出安息日被改为礼拜日是违反摩西十诫的。再也没有比改安息日让他们提及更多的事情了。他们说教会的权力太大了竟然废弃十诫中的一条。

Notes:

The three samples mentioned to illustrate the issue are concerning, first, meats, that is, abstaining from food altogether by fasting or abstaining at least from certain kinds of food. The apostles fasted. The first Christians fasted. When the congregation at Antioch was to ordain Paul and Barnabas for their first great mission journey, they “fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them” (Acts 13:3). Paul and Barnabas “with prayer and fasting, committed them [the Christians in Galatia] to the Lord” (Acts 14:23). Fasting was preparatory for prayer. Later, fasting came to be considered as in itself meritorious, as helping to wipe out the guilt of sin.

为了阐明这个问题而提到的三个例子第一个就是关于肉的，禁食不吃任何的东西或不吃哪一类的东西。使徒们曾禁食。早期的基督徒们也曾禁食。当安提阿的教会要差保罗和巴拿巴第一次出去宣教时，他们“禁食祷告，按手在他们头上”（使徒行传13:3）保罗和巴拿巴“又禁食祷告，就把他们（加拉太基督徒）交托所信的主”（使徒行传14:23）。禁食是为了预备祷告。后来禁食被视为一种功德可以除去人的罪。

A second ceremony is that of holy-days and whether or not they had to be observed or whether they were matters of indifference and Christian freedom.

第二个仪式就是圣日，到底是不是必须守它们还是基督徒有自由它们是可守可不守的。

The third ceremony has to do with the question of rank among the clergy. In the early church there was no such question. In Jerusalem the apostles were the leaders; and when the work increased, then (for the purpose of greater efficiency and to avoid unnecessary friction) a division of labor was effected by electing seven leaders who were know to be filled with the Holy Spirit to wait on tables so that the poor were not neglected. Later James served as presiding elder (Acts 12:17;15:13). Bishops and elders were then the same persons holding the same office. Besides them we find evangelists, prophets, pastors, teachers (Romans 12:6ff.; 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11). But even in the early church, a tendency toward an abuse of the office became noticeable. Peter expressly warns the elders that they must not try to pose as “lords over God’s heritage” (1 Peter 5:3 KJV). Before long, however, the idea of a hierarchical grading among the clergy gained ground; lower orders and higher orders were introduced, and to be subject to the bishop and to the pope was made a matter of conscience at the risk of eternal damnation. Listen to the famous bull Unam Sanctam which Pope Boniface VIII published on November 18, 1302, the concluding sentence reads: “In fine, we declare, state, define, and pronounce that to be subject to the Roman Pontiff is to every human being absolutely necessary for salvation.”

第三个仪式是关于教职人员的等级问题。在早期教会不存在这样的问题。在耶路撒冷使徒们就是带领人；随后事工扩展的时候（为了更有效和避免摩擦）他们进行了分工，他们选七位充满圣灵的人去管理饭食照顾穷人。后来雅各做长老（使徒行传12:17,；15:13）。主教和长老那时候还没有分开。除了这些职位外我们看到还有传道人、先知、牧师和老师（罗马书12:6；哥林多前书12:28；以弗所书4:11）。但即使是在早期教会滥用职位的倾向还是比较明显。彼得清楚的警告长老们不要“辖制所托付你们的”（彼得前书5:3）。然而没过多久教职人员等级制度思想便腾空出世；教会中即有上层也有下层，他们不顾永远的刑罚竟把顺服主教和顺服教皇说成是良心之事。让我们看一下教皇博尼费斯八世于1302年十一月在兀纳姆伞克塔姆教令所公布的，最后几句是这样的：我们宣布、说明、规定和宣告顺服罗马教皇是每个人得救所必须做的。

V. But concerning this question it is taught on our part (as has been shown above) that bishops have no power to decree anything against the Gospel. The Canonical Laws teach the same thing (Dist. IX).  Now, it is against Scripture to establish or require the observance of any traditions, to the end that by such observance we may make satisfaction for sins, or merit grace and righteousness.  For the glory of Christ's merit suffers injury when, by such observances, we undertake to merit justification. But it is manifest that, by such belief, traditions have almost infinitely multiplied in the Church, the doctrine concerning faith and the righteousness of faith being meanwhile suppressed. For gradually more holy-days were made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services in honor of saints instituted, because the authors of such things thought that by these works they were meriting  grace. Thus in times past the Penitential Canons increased, whereof we still see some traces in the satisfactions.

关于这个问题我们教导的是（正如我们前面所看到的）主教没有权利去规定任何与福音违背的事情。教会法也是这样教导的（Dist.IX）。如果遵守一些条例最终是为了使我们可以赎罪或赢得恩典和称义，那么设立或要求守这些条例就是违背圣经的。很明显正是因为有这样的信仰才使教会的传统在无限制的骤增，但是与此同时信心和因信称义的教导却被埋没。渐渐的圣日越来越多，规定禁食，设立更多纪念圣徒的仪式和服侍，因为兴起这些事情的人认为这些可以使他们赢得恩典。过去制定了很多的的惩罚教条，从其中的赎罪方法我们还可以看出些许痕迹。

Notes:

注：

Throughout, our fathers keep this truth clear that ceremonies are not in themselves against the gospel, as for instance, when they are instituted for the sake of good order and the convenience of the Christians. They conflict with the gospel only then when they are practiced to merit justification, when we imagine that by them we may make satisfaction for sins, or merit grace and righteousness.

至始至终我们的前辈们都明确这样一个真理就是任何仪式都不得违背福音，仪式的设立是为了有更好的秩序和给基督徒提供方便。当仪式以赢得称义为目的，当我们认为仪式可以赎我们的罪或赢得恩典和称义时就是违背福音了。

When this takes place, the doctrine concerning faith and the righteousness of faith was being suppressed. Hence, ceremonies practiced in this sense are plainly against the Gospel.

当出现这种情况时，关于信心和因信称义的教义就被埋没了。因此，这样的仪式是显然违背福音的。

Now, concerning the law.

至于关于律法。

Again, the authors of traditions do contrary to the command of God when they find matters of sin in foods, in days, and like things, and burden the Church with bondage of the law, as if there ought to be among Christians, in order to merit justification a service like the Levitical, the arrangement of which God had committed to the Apostles and bishops. For thus some of them write; and the Pontiffs in some measure seem to be misled by the example  of the law of Moses. Hence are such burdens, as that they make it mortal sin, even without offense to others, to do manual labor on holy-days, a mortal sin to omit the Canonical Hours, that certain foods defile the conscience that fastings are works which appease God that sin in a reserved case cannot be forgiven but by the authority of him who reserved it; whereas the Canons themselves speak only of the reserving of the ecclesiastical penalty, and not of the reserving of the guilt.

设立这样传统的人是违背神的命令的，他们认为某些食物或日子等是有罪的把教会陷于律法之下，好像基督徒要赢得称义就必须有神所应许给使徒和主教的像利未人一样的服侍。他们有些人就是这样写；教皇也多少误读了摩西律法。因此就带来这样的辖制，如在圣日做工即便没有冒犯他人也是不可饶恕的大罪；错过祷告时间也是不可饶恕的大罪；某些食物会污秽人心；禁食可以使神满足；保留个案的罪只有有权保留个案的人才能饶恕；在这一点上教会法只是说保留教会的惩罚而不是保留罪。

Notes:

注：

First of all, it is a grave violation of the law if we declare anything to be a sin which God has not forbidden. Read the following…

首先，我们宣布神没有禁止的事情为罪就是严重违背律法了。

Deuteronomy 4:2 Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.

申命记4:2 所吩咐你们的话，你们不可加添，也不可删减，好叫你们遵守我所吩咐的，就是耶和华你们神的命令。

Matthew 15:7-9 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: “‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’”

马太福音 15:7-9 假冒为善的人哪，以赛亚指着你们说的豫言，是不错的。他说, 8这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。9他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。

The Roman Catholic Church is violating the law in this respect: they assume that a service like the Levitical must be maintained among Christians, and they apply the example of the Law of Moses to the Church of the New Testament. The ceremonial Law of Moses contained commandments regulating the priesthood, the order of services, the Sabbath days and other festivals, sacrifices, meats and drinks, circumcision, etc. The purpose of these regulations was limited strictly to the Old Testament. They were to serve, as St. Paul expresses it in Ephesians 2:14, as a “dividing wall of hostility” between the Jews and the Gentiles; or, as he says in Galatians 3:23, the Jews were “held prisoners by the law” and “locked up” by it to protect them against contamination from the sins of surrounding Gentiles. Chiefly, however, the ceremonies prescribed by Moses were to prefigure Christ. Every sacrifice pointed to the coming sacrifice of Christ, and every Sabbath pointed to the restoration of God’s sabbatical rest which he had prepared for man in the beginning. Thus all prescribed forms and ceremonies were ordained for the Old Testament; in the New Testament they were to be done away with. They were merely a shadow, but the reality is now found in Christ. Now St. Paul says to the Christians: “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day” (Collossians 2:16). If bishops then try to establish any ouward order or ceremony as essential to the church, they are doing this contrary to the command of God – they are binding something on the consciences of Christians which God himself repealed by the death of Christ.

罗马天主教在这方面是违背律法的：他们认为应该有像利未人一样的服侍，他们把摩西律法应用到了新约时代的教会。摩西关于仪式的律法包括祭司的规定、敬拜的程序、安息日和其它节日、献祭、肉和饮用的、割礼等等。这些规定的应用严格限于旧约时期。如保罗在以弗所书2:14所说他们的作用是犹太人和外邦人“中间隔断的墙”；或者他在加拉太书3:23，犹太人被“看守在律法之下”和“圈在”律法里，这是为了保护犹太人不受外邦人罪的沾染。摩西所加给他们的律法是预表基督。所有的献祭是要表明将来基督要献的祭，而安息日也是要表明要恢复神在起初所给人预备的安息。因此所有这些特定的形式和仪式都是为着旧约时代而定；在新约时代是要被废弃的。这些都只是影子，形体乃是基督。圣保罗对基督徒说：所以不拘在饮食上，或节期，月朔，安息日，都不可让人论断你们（歌罗西书2:16）。如果主教要设立任何外在的命令或仪式并且认为它们是教会必不可少的，那么他们就是在违背神的命令—他们要把人心辖制在基督藉十架已经废除的东西之下。

The third and by far worst violation of the law consists in this that all such ceremonies are commanded as necessary in order to merit justification. No law of God was ever given for that purpose. The purpose of the law is threefold. Chiefly, it is to lie on our consciences as a heavy burden so as to make us aware of our sins and guilt and our own utter inability to save ourselves. It is to shake or rattle our conscience so that we begin to realize how filthy our hearts are. In one word, the law is to serve as a mirror. Then God uses the law with its punishments (in the form of police and courts and prisons, or in the form of calamities and disasters) in order to keep the wicked within certain bounds. The law serves as a curb. Last, the Christians, who desire to lead a God-pleasing life, will find in the law a convenient rule to guid them. Never does the law serve the purpose of meriting justification.

第三个也是迄今为止对律法最严重的违背就是他们要求人们以遵守这些仪式来赢得称义。神的律法原不是这样的。律法的功用有三方面。律法首要的功用是使良心产生亏欠从而使我们认识到我们的罪过和自己没有自救能力。律法是要是震动我们的良心使我们认识到自己的心是多么污秽。一言以蔽之，律法是一面镜子。神用律法的惩戒功用（以警察、法庭和监狱的形式，或以天灾人祸的方式）把恶人约束在一定的范围内。律法是界线。最后，基督徒要过神喜悦的生活可以在律法中找到指引。律法从没有使人赢得称义的功用。

VI. Whence have the bishops the right to lay these traditions upon the Church for the ensnaring of consciences, when Peter, Acts 15:10, forbids to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, and Paul says, 2 Cor. 13:10, that the power given him was to edification not to destruction? Why, therefore, do they increase sins by these traditions?

主教们用自己的权利把这些捆绑人心的传统加于教会，彼得在使徒行传15：10禁止把轭放在门徒的颈项上，保罗说，林后13:10 赐给他的权柄是要早就人不是要败坏人。为什么他们用这些传统使罪增加呢？

Notes:

The two passages to which our fathers here refer are worthy of closer study. Acts 15 tells us the story of the apostles’ council in Jerusalem. There were fanatics in the church at Jerusalem who went to Antioch and there severely criticized the mission work of Paul and Barnabas because they admitted Gentiles into the church without the ceremony of circumcision. They considered circumcision as necessary for salvation, and insisted over against the Christians in Antioch that it was the established custom strictly observed in Jerusalem. The congregation at Antioch sent a delegation, including Paul and Barnabas, to Jerusalem to discuss the matter with the church there.

我们的前辈们所提到的两篇文章值得认真学习。使徒行传15章告诉我们师徒在耶路撒冷的会议。在耶路撒冷教会有热心者去安提强烈批评保罗和巴拿巴的事工，因为他们让没有受割礼的外邦人进入教会。他们认为只有受割礼才能得救并且反对安提阿基督徒说割礼是耶路撒冷教会严格恪守的。安提阿教会派包括保罗和巴拿巴在内的代表团去耶路撒冷去跟当地教会交通割礼的事。

In Jerusalem certain Christians, who were very devout but had a Pharisaic backround, also though that Gentiles coming into the church must be compelled to observe the ceremonies commanded by Moses. A lively debate resulted. Then Peter arose and reminded the assembly of the fact that some time ago God through a special vision had sent him to preach the gospel in the house of Cornelius, and that, without circumcision or any other ceremony. He had poured his Holy Spirit on these former Gentiles. Peter emphasized that God did not make the slightest distinction between former Jews and former Gentiles, but purified the hearts of both by faith.

在耶路撒冷有些基督徒，他们非常虔诚但是有法利赛背景认为来到教会的外邦人也应该遵守摩西的律例。因此引起了唇枪舌战。然后彼得站起来告诉大家神曾在异象中差他去哥尼流家中去传福音，神并没有要割礼或其它的律例。神将圣灵浇灌在曾经为外邦人的身上。彼得强调神不再区分曾经的犹太人和曾经的外邦人而是藉着信洁净了所有人。

Then he spoke the words to which our Article refers: “Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?” (Acts 15:10). In the Old Testament the Jews observed ceremonies which God himself had commanded thorugh Moses, but which had been fulfilled in Christ. They were “a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ” (Colossians 2:17). Therefore they could well be dropped, since they had served their purpose and had now become meaningless. To enforce them still as necessary for salvation was nothing short of tempting God, as Peter bluntly says. If that is true of ceremonies which God himself once had instituted, then how is it that the bishops seem to think that they have the right to lay their ceremonies upon the church? To reintroduce ceremonies as necessary for salvation which God himself had abolished, and to demand submission to new man-made ceremonies in order to merit God’s favor, has no other effect than that of ensnaring of consciences.

然后他说了今天我们文章所引用的一段话：现在为什么试探神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭，放在门徒的颈项上呢（使徒行传15:10）。在旧约时代犹太人守神藉摩西所传的律法，但是这一切都被基督成就了。这些原是后事的影儿。那形体却是基督（歌罗西书2:17）。因此律法可以完全放弃因为它们已经尽了自己的功用已经不再有用了。再强调它们是得救必须的就是在实验神了，正如彼得坦白所言。如果神所定的这些仪式已经废弃那么主教怎么会认为他们有权力把这些仪式加给教会呢？把神所废弃的仪式再拿出来并且认为它们是得救的必须，要求人们遵守人所定的规条来赢得神的恩典，这除了是对良心的捆绑外毫无用处。

But there are clear testimonies which prohibit the making of such traditions, as though they merited grace or were necessary to salvation. Paul says, Col. 2:16-23: Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath-days.  If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch not; taste not; handle not, which all are to perish with the using) after the commandments and doctrines of men! which things have indeed a show of wisdom.  Also in Titus 1:14 he openly forbids traditions: Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth.

有清楚的证据证明不应该设立这样的传统并以为它们可以赢得恩典和是得救所必须的。保罗说，歌罗西书2:16-23所以不拘在饮食上，或节期，月朔，安息日，都不可让人论断你们。你们若是与基督同死，脱离了世上的小学，为什么仍像在世俗中活着，服从那不可拿，不可尝，不可摸，等类的规条呢。这些规条，使人徒有智慧之名.还有在提多书1:14他公开的禁止这些传统： 不听犹太人荒渺的言语，和离弃真道之人的诫命。

Notes:

注：

The congregation in Colossia, also the neighboring churches in Laodicea and Hierapolis that were connected with the Colossians, were troubled by false teachers who demanded the observance of certain ceremonies as necessary for salvation. The elder of this church, Epaphras, went to Paul, who at that time was in prison for the gospel’s sake, and laid the matter before him. He came to their assistance by writing the epistle to the Colossians, which we have in our New Testament. He reminded them that we have everything in Christ: all fullness dwells in him – all knowledge, all wisdom, all spiritual understanding. IN him we have redemption – complete redemption – through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. He is our hope of glory; being grounded and settled and not moved away from the faith, being rooted and built up in him, we are complete in him (Colossians 2:10). Yes, complete, lacking nothing.

当时歌罗西教会和临近的跟他们有联系的老底嘉教会和希拉波利斯教会被一些假教师迷惑，他们教导人遵守某些诫命才能得救。歌罗西教会长老以巴弗去找因福音被囚的保罗把这件事向他讲明。保罗写了我们现在新约的这封书信来帮助当时的歌罗西教会。保罗提醒他们我们的一切都在主里面，所有的丰富都住在主里—各样的知识、智慧和属灵的悟性。我们的救恩也在于他—完全的救恩—靠他的宝血的来的，可以赦免我们的罪。他是我们荣耀的盼望；我们要信心坚固不动摇，在他的里面扎根建造，在他的里面我们也得了丰盛（歌罗西书2:10）。是的，丰盛一无所缺。

Titus was left by Paul on the island of Crete to carry on mission work. Crete was a difficult field. Paul describes the people in these words: “For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group. They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach…Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith” (Titus 1:10-13).

保罗留提多在革哩底岛做福音的工作。革哩底岛是困难重重的福音禾场。保罗这样描述这里的人：因为有许多人不服约束，说虚空话，欺哄人。那奉割礼的，更是这样。这些人的口总要堵住。他们因贪不义之财，将不该教导的教导人，败坏人的全家…所以你要严严的责备他们，使他们在真道上纯全无疵（提多书1:10-13）.

And Christ, Matt. 15:14,13, says of those who require traditions: Let them alone; they be blind leaders of the blind; and He rejects such services: Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be plucked up.

基督在马太福音15:14,13这样说那些坚持这些传统的人：任凭他们吧。他们是瞎眼领路的；神拒绝这样的服侍：凡栽种的物，若不是我父栽种的，必要拔出来。

Notes:

注：

Let these words be a warning to us that we put our whole trust in our Savior and lead a life of gratitude by the strength which he supplies in the gospel, without burdening our own or our fellow Christians’ conscience with man-made rules.

让我们能够以这些话为警戒，我们应该完全的仰望救主靠福音加给我们的力量过感恩的生活，不要用人定的规矩来辖制我们或别人的良心

VII. If bishops have the right to burden churches with infinite traditions, and to ensnare consciences, why does Scripture so often prohibit to make, and to listen to, traditions? Why does it call them "doctrines of devils"? 1 Tim. 4:1. Did the Holy Ghost in vain forewarn of these things?

如果主教们有权利把这些没有穷尽的传统强加于教会和捆绑人的良心，为什么圣经经常禁止制定和听从这样的规条呢？为什么圣经称之为“鬼魔的道理”提前4:1. 难道圣灵的警告是徒劳的吗？

Since, therefore, ordinances instituted as things necessary, or with an opinion of meriting grace, are contrary to the Gospel, it follows that it is not lawful for any bishop  to institute or exact such services. For it is necessary that the doctrine of Christian liberty be preserved in the churches, namely, that the bondage of the Law is not necessary to justification, as it is written in the Epistle to the Galatians 5:1: Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.  It is necessary that the chief article of the Gospel be preserved, to wit, that we obtain grace freely by faith in Christ, and not for certain observances or acts of worship devised by men.

任何认为是得救必须或能够赢得恩典的规条都是与福音违背的，因此主教制定会要求人们遵守这样的规条也是不合宜的。教会应该保证基督徒的自由也就是称义是不受律法辖的，正如写给加拉太的书信5:1：不要再被奴仆的轭挟制。我们应该持守福音的要义，也就是我们因信白白的从基督受恩并不是靠着我们守什么或按人的方式敬拜。

Notes:

主：

Man-made ordinances imposed by the church are doctrines of devils that stand in direct conflict with the glorious gospel freedom that we have in Christ Jesus. For this reason, it is very important that we stand firm, as St. Paul says, and guard the gospel with every fiber of our being, lest one soul be lost. Paul writes, “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1).

教会强加的人的规定是鬼魔的道理，是与我们在基督耶稣里的福音所带来的荣耀的自由是相冲突的。因此我们要站立稳固，如同圣保罗所说的，并要警醒为福音守望不让一个灵魂沉沦。保罗写道：基督释放了我们，叫我们得自由，所以要站立得稳，不要再被奴仆的轭挟制（加拉太书5:1）。

After repeating the argument of the second part of our Article, our fathers, in the third part, take up the special question concerning our Sunday worship.

在重述本篇第二部分的看法之后我们的前辈们在第三部分接着讨论周日崇拜的具体问题。

What, then, are we to think of the Sunday and like rites in the house of God? To this we answer that it is lawful for bishops or pastors to make ordinances that things be done orderly in the Church, not that thereby we should merit grace or make satisfaction for sins, or that consciences be bound to judge them necessary services, and to think that it is a sin to break them  without offense to others. So Paul ordains, 1 Cor. 11:5, that women should cover their heads in the congregation, 1 Cor. 14:30, that interpreters be heard in order in the church, etc.

在神家里我们是如何看待主日和相关的仪式的？我们认为主教或牧师有权制定规则使教会更加有序而不是使我们可以靠着赢得恩典或罪得赦免，使良心受辖制把这些规条看为必须的或即便不得罪人违背它们也是犯罪的。因此保罗要求，林前11:5女人聚会应该蒙头，林前14:30，翻方言的人应该按顺序来翻，等等。

It is proper that the churches should keep such ordinances for the sake of love and tranquillity, so far that one do not offend another, that all things be done in the churches in order, and without confusion, 1 Cor. 14:40; comp. Phil. 2:14 .  but so that consciences be not burdened to think that they are necessary to salvation, or to judge that they sin when they break them without offense to others; as no one will say that a woman sins who goes out in public with her head uncovered provided only that no offense be given.

教会为了爱和安定去守这些规条是合理的，以便人与人能够更好相处，教会能够更加有序和没有争论，林前14:40对比腓2:14.但是良心不能受捆绑，不要认为这些是得救必须的，或者即便没有得罪人违反规条也是犯罪；因为如果妇女没有蒙头出门也没有得罪人没有人认为她是犯罪的。

Notes:

注：

The main point is that any ordinance is not to be considered as meriting grace or making satisfaction for sins, but is to serve merely the purpose of love and tranquillity, so that things may be done orderly in the church.

主旨就是所有的规条都不是为了赢得恩典或赎罪而是单单为了爱人和安定，以便教会事务能够有条不紊。

VIII. Of this kind is the observance of the Lord's Day, Easter, Pentecost, and like holy-days and  rites. For those who judge that by the authority of the Church the observance of the Lord's Day instead of the Sabbath-day was ordained as a thing necessary,  do greatly err. Scripture has abrogated the Sabbath-day; for it teaches that, since the Gospel has been revealed, all the ceremonies of Moses can be omitted. And  yet, because it was necessary to appoint a certain day, that the people might know when they ought to come together, it appears that the Church designated the Lord's Day for this purpose; and this day seems to have been chosen all the more for this additional reason, that men might have an example of Christian liberty, and might know that the keeping neither of the Sabbath nor of any other day is necessary.

守主日、复活节、五旬节和其它圣日和仪式都是如此。那些认为因着教会的规定所以必须是主日而不是安息日的人是大错特错了。圣经已经废除了安息日；因为圣经教导自从福音被显明以后摩西的律例就被取消了。但是还需要定一个日子以便大家可以聚在一起。为着这个目的教会就定主日为这一天。选择主日这一天还有另外一个原因就是为了树立一个基督徒自由的榜样，让人们都看到既不是必须守安息日也不是必须守某个日子。

Notes:

注：

Some Christians are of the opinion that our present Sunday has taken the place of the Old Testament Sabbath.

有些基督徒认为现在的礼拜日是旧约安息日的代替。

When God created the world, he instituted the Sabbath for man, filling it with his glorious rest of holiness. Through our fall into sin, we forfeited this rest and holiness; in their stead, sin and the curse infested the earth. But God at once promised to send a Savior who would bring back his peace and holiness to us. When God chose Israel to prepare for the coming of the Messiah, he gave them the Sabbath both as a reminder of the lost blessings and as a shadow of the restoration to come in Christ.

当神创立世界的时候他为人设立了安息日，其中有他圣洁荣耀的安息。但是我们因为落入罪中而破坏了这种圣洁和安息；取而代之的遍满全地的罪和咒诅。神随即应许会为我们差派一位救主把平安和圣洁从新带给我们。当神拣选以色列民来预备救主的到来时，他赐给他们安息日一来是作为对失去的祝福的纪念，二来是作为基督将要做的恢复工作的影子。

IX. There are monstrous disputations concerning the changing of the law, the ceremonies of the new law, the changing of the Sabbath-day, which all have sprung from the false belief that there must needs be in the Church a service like to the Levitical, and that Christ had given commission to the Apostles and bishops to devise new ceremonies as necessary to  salvation. These errors crept into the Church when the righteousness of faith was not taught clearly enough.  Some dispute that the keeping of the Lord's Day is not indeed of divine right, but in a manner so. They prescribe concerning holy-days, how far it is lawful to work. What else  are such disputations than snares of consciences? For although they endeavor to modify the traditions, yet the mitigation can never be perceived as long as the opinion remains that they are necessary, which must needs remain where the righteousness of faith and Christian liberty are not known.

改变律法和新的律例的规定和改变安息日引起了巨大的争议。这一切都源于人们错误的认为教会需要有像利未人一样的服侍和基督给使徒和保罗去制定能够让人得救的仪式。教会中产生这种错误是因为没有人明确教导因信称义。有些人争论说守主日并不是神所定的只不过是习惯成自然。他们规定在主日做工是符合律法的。这些争论难道不只是辖制良心吗？尽管人们在尽力修改这些传统但只要他们认为它们是得救必须的而没有认识到因信称义和基督徒的自由那么情况就不会有所改善。

The Apostles commanded Acts 15:20 to abstain from blood. Who does now observe it? And yet they that do it not sin not; for not even the Apostles themselves wanted to burden consciences with such bondage; but they forbade it for a time, to avoid offense.  For in this decree we must perpetually consider what the aim of the Gospel is.

使徒们在使徒行传15:20吩咐我们要禁戒血。为什么要遵守这规定呢？定不可这样做的人不是在犯罪；因为即便是使徒也不想用它来捆绑辖制良心；他们禁止这样是在一个特定的事情为了避免干犯他人。在这条规定里我们要不断考虑福音的目的是什么？

Scarcely any Canons are kept with exactness, and from day to day many go out of use even among those who are the most zealous advocates of traditions.  Neither can due regard be paid to consciences unless this mitigation be observed, that we know that the Canons are kept without holding them to be necessary, and that no harm is done consciences, even though traditions go out of use.

能一成不变的完全守教会法的是少有的，渐渐的很多教会法都被淘汰，即便那些热心提倡传统的人也很少使用它们。除非情况有所改善，守教会法是可以的但不要把它们看为得救的必要，即便传统被遗弃也不要因此良心受到攻击，否则我们就不应该太注意良心。

But the bishops might easily retain the lawful obedience of the people if they would not insist upon the observance of such traditions as cannot be kept with a good conscience.  Now they command celibacy; they admit none unless they swear that they will not teach  the pure doctrine of the Gospel. The churches do not ask that the bishops should restore concord at the expense of their honor; which, nevertheless,  it would be proper for good pastors to do. They ask only that they would release unjust burdens which are new and have been received contrary to the custom of the Church Catholic.  It may be that in the beginning there were plausible reasons for some of these ordinances; and yet they are not adapted to later times.  It is also evident that some were adopted through erroneous conceptions. Therefore it would be befitting the clemency of the Pontiffs to mitigate them now, because such a modification does not shake the unity of the Church. For many human traditions have been changed in process of time,  as the Canons themselves show. But if it be impossible to obtain a mitigation of such observances as cannot be kept without sin, we are bound to follow the apostolic rule, Acts 5:29, which commands us to obey God rather than men.

如果主教们不要求人们来受那些使良心不受安慰的教会传统那么人们顺服他们是很容易的。他们要求人要独身；除非人发誓说不讲存正的福音否则他们一律不接待。教会没有要求主教们为和睦放下脸面；而这样的事是称职的牧师会做的。教会只是要求牧师拆除他们不公正的加给教会的与天主教传统违背的辖制。或许这些规条在设立之初有似乎合理的理由但是已经不符合后来的时代了。还有一些很明显的来自错误的观念。因此改善这种情况是符合教皇的宽厚仁慈形象的，况且这些修改变动并不会影响教会的统一的。因为从教会法也可以看出随着时间的推移很多人的传统一直在改变。但是如果不可能修改这些致人犯罪的规条的话，我们就必须要遵守使徒的原则了，使徒行传5:29，要我们顺从神而不是顺从人。

Peter, 1 Pet. 5:3, forbids bishops to be lords, and to rule over the churches.  It is not our design now to wrest the government from the bishops, but this one thing is asked, namely, that they allow the Gospel to be purely taught, and that they relax some few observances which  cannot be kept without sin. But if they make no concession, it is for them to see how they shall give account to God for furnishing, by their obstinacy, a cause for schism.

彼得，彼前 5:3，禁止主教们去辖制教会。我们并不是要剥夺主教的权利而是要要求一件事情，也就是他们能教导存正的福音和除去那些致人犯罪的规条。如果他们不愿意做出让步的话，他们自己就要因自己的顽固而导致教会分裂而向神交差了。
