There has been common complaint concerning the examples of priests who were not chaste. http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php - article23.2 For that reason also Pope Pius is reported to have said that there were certain causes why marriage was taken away from priests, but that there were far weightier ones why it ought to be given back; for so Platina writes.  Since, therefore, our priests were desirous to avoid these open scandals, they married wives, and taught that it was lawful for them to contract matrimony. First, because Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:2,9: To avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife. Also: It is better to marry than to burn. Secondly  Christ says, Matt. 19:11: All men cannot receive this saying, where He teaches that not all men are fit to lead a single life; for God created man for procreation, Gen. 1:28.  Nor is it in man's power, without a singular gift and work of God, to alter this creation. [For it is manifest, and many have confessed that no good, honest, chaste life, no Christian, sincere, upright conduct has resulted (from the attempt), but a horrible, fearful unrest and torment of conscience has been felt by many until the end.] Therefore, those who are not fit to lead a single life ought to contract matrimony. For no man's law, no vow, can annul the commandment and ordinance of God. For these reasons the priests teach that it is lawful for them to marry wives.

有一人人抱怨之事，就是教牧不贞洁的榜样。因这缘故据说教皇庇乌（Pius）曾有“禁止教牧婚娶自有理由，然有许多更重要的理由应再准许教牧婚娶”之言，因为拍拉替拿（Platina）曾如此记载。因此我们教会的教牧为避免这些使众人跌倒的事，就都有家室，而且教导人说，教牧婚娶是合理的。第一，因为保罗在林前7:2,9说：“但要免淫乱的事，男子当各有自己的妻子。”又说：“与其欲火攻心，倒不如嫁娶为妙”。第二，基督说，太19:11：“这话不是人人能领受的”；这一处祂教训人不是人人宜于独居的生活，创1:28，因为上帝造人，是造男造女。没有上帝特别的禀赋和作为，人也没有能力更改祂的创造。所以凡不宜于独居的，就当嫁娶。因为没有人的律法，没有誓愿，可废弃上帝的命令和定制。因这些理由教牧说，他们婚娶是合理的。

It is also evident that in the ancient Church priests were married men.  For Paul says, 1 Tim. 3:2, that a bishop should be chosen who is the husband of one wife.  And in Germany, four hundred years ago for the first time, the priests were violently compelled to lead a single life, who indeed offered such resistance that the Archbishop of Mayence, when about to publish the Pope's decree concerning this matter, was almost killed in the tumult raised by the enraged priests.  And so harsh was the dealing in the matter that not only were marriages forbidden for the future, but also existing marriages were torn asunder, contrary to all laws, divine and human, contrary even to the Canons themselves, made not only by the Popes, but by most celebrated Synods. [Moreover, many God-fearing and intelligent people in high station are known frequently to have expressed misgivings that such enforced celibacy and depriving men of marriage (which God Himself has instituted and left free to men) has never produced any good results, but has brought on many great and evil vices and much iniquity.]

尽人皆知古教会的教牧是有妻子的。因为保罗：“作监督的必须是作丈夫的”（提前3：2）。在日耳曼要到四百年前教牧受暴力的压制才守独身；那时他们曾竭全力反抗这事，以致买音慈（Mayence）的大主教将公布罗马教皇诏谕时，几因教牧的忿怒在暴动中遇害。而且那事办得如此无理：甚至不但禁止以后不可娶亲，连那已经订了婚约的也得解除婚约。这样的事违反上帝和人的一切法律，违反以前教皇所颁布的教条，也违反教会最有名的议会所颁布的教条。［况且，有很多敬畏神和有见识之士经常担心这些强迫的独身和剥夺婚姻（神所设立的给人的自由）从来没有产生积极的结果，带来的只是邪恶和罪。］

Seeing also that, as the world is aging, man's nature is gradually growing weaker, it is well to guard that no more vices steal into Germany.

还应该看到，随着时间的流逝人的本性也在渐渐的变弱，应该防范不让恶行在进入德国。

Furthermore, God ordained marriage to be a help against human infirmity.  The Canons themselves say that the old rigor ought now and then, in the latter times, to be relaxed because of the weakness of men; which it is to be wished were done also in this matter.  And it is to be expected that the churches shall at some time lack pastors if marriage is any longer forbidden.

况且上帝设立婚姻，原为补救人的软弱。教条也说，古时严峻的风气在晚近时代因人的软弱有时当济以宽大。在教牧婚娶的事上我们盼望也照此而行。若再禁止婚姻，教会终恐有缺少教牧之患。

But while the commandment of God is in force, while the custom of the Church is well known, while impure celibacy causes many scandals, adulteries, and other crimes deserving the punishments of just magistrates, yet it is a marvelous thing that in nothing is more cruelty exercised than against  the marriage of priests. God has given commandment to honor marriage. By the laws of all well-ordered commonwealths, even among the heathen, marriage is most highly honored. But now men, and that, priests, are cruelly put to death, contrary to the intent of the Canons, for no other cause than marriage. Paul, in 1 Tim. 4:3, calls that a doctrine of devils which forbids marriage.   This may now be readily understood when the law against marriage is maintained by such penalties.

这样，既然有上帝的明令，有人所共知教会的成规，而且不贞洁的独居生活既然生出许多叫人跌倒，淫乱，和其他作奸犯科当受正直官府刑罚的事，然而他们在反对教牧婚娶上比在其他事上显露更多的残忍，这真是奇怪。上帝曾吩咐人尊重婚姻：凡有纲纪的国家的法律都大大尊重婚姻，连异邦人亦复如此。但如今有人，甚至教牧，不因别事，单为娶亲，而被处死刑，这是违反教条本意的。保罗在提前4:3称禁止婚姻为魔鬼的道理；这话如今是很显然的，因为执行婚姻的禁令，竟用如此极刑。

But as no law of man can annul the commandment of God, so neither can it be done by any vow.  Accordingly, Cyprian also advises that women who do not keep the chastity they have promised should marry. His words are these (Book I, Epistle XI): But if they be unwilling or unable to persevere, it is better for them to marry than to fall into the fire by their lusts; they should certainly give no offense to their brethren and sisters.

但人的律法既不能废掉上帝的律法，不论何种誓愿亦自不能。所以居普良劝勉那不守贞洁誓愿的妇女出嫁。他在第一卷第十一封书信中曾如此说：“她们若不愿意，或守不住，与其因欲念的缠扰陷入火坑，就不如出嫁。无论怎样，她们不要使弟兄或姊妹跌倒。”

And even the Canons show some leniency toward those who have taken vows before the proper age, as heretofore has generally been the case.

就是教条也宽待没有长大成人而立了童身誓愿的；直到如今这规矩还是通行。

Forced Celibacy is yet another example of why Luther had to reform the church catholic back to its genuine purpose of saving souls. The Lutherans maintained that the Church has no authority from God to command what He has not commanded, nor to forbid what He has not forbidden. The Bible clearly teaches that the Apostle Peter had a wife. This example should have served as convincing proof that priestly marriages were God pleasing. That there are men given the gift of chastity is affirmed, but the view that the Church can, and should, forbid all who wish to be priests from marrying is resoundingly rejected. Marriage is a gift from God to be received with thanksgiving both by laypeople and clergy. To suggest otherwise is to introduce a teaching of the devil into the Church.

强迫单身是路德要把天主教改革成以拯救灵魂为目的的教会的另一个原因。路德宗认为教会没有权力来添加神所要求的，或添加神所禁止的。圣经清楚的提到使徒彼得有一个妻子。这应该是一个神悦纳教牧婚姻的一个证据。有些人确有独身的恩赐，但是应该坚决反对认为教会可以并且应该禁止所有要成为教牧的人去结婚的看法。婚姻是神的恩赐，无论是普通信徒还是神职人员都应该存感恩的心领受。看法与此不同就是把魔鬼的道理带入教会。

Even pope Pius is reported as saying that although there are reasons why marriage was taken away from priests, there are far more important reasons why it should be given back.

即便教皇庇护也说教牧不能结婚有几个原因，但是教牧可以结婚却有更重要的原因。

Paul tells us “Because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife” and “It is better to marry than to be aflame with passion” (I Cor. 7:2, 9b). The result of this devilish yoke that has been placed on priests for centuries is widespread homosexuality and pedophilia inside of the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic League in America is made up of priests in this country who are trying to defend homosexual behavior within the church. Could this be due to the fact that many of the heterosexual priests desiring to serve God in this capacity simply could not? Perhaps we will never know. But this is yet another long standing abuse inside of the Roman Catholic Church.

保罗告诉我们“但要免淫乱的事，男人当各有自己的妻子”和“与其欲火攻心，倒不如嫁娶为妙”（林前7:2,9b）。这个几个世纪来带在教牧身上的魔鬼的枷锁所带来的就是在罗马天主教内司空见惯的同性恋和恋童癖。美国天主教联盟就是由一群支持教会内同性恋的教牧组成的。这是因为很多异性恋的教牧要用这样服侍主却发现不可能吗？也许我们永远不会知道。这是罗马天主教中长时间以来存在的又一滥用。

In Genesis 1:28 God tells us that he created human beings for procreation. Who then, is the church, to go against what God has ordained?

在创世纪1:28 神告诉我们他造人是要人生养众多。那么是哪个教会违背神的命令的？

Our Lutheran brothers defied this new law of the Roman Catholic Church as well, stating that “No human law, no vow, can destroy God’s commandment and ordinance.”

我们路德宗的弟兄们也反对罗马天主教的这条新规，他们说“没有任何人的律法或誓言可能废弃神的命令和典章。

Did the ancient church marry? We’ve already mentioned that Peter was married. But Paul, too, affirms marriage when he says, “An overseer must be the husband of one wife” (I Tim 3:2).

早期的教会嫁娶吗？我们已经提到彼得结过婚。保罗也肯定婚姻，他这样说“监督必须只做一个妇人的丈夫”（提前3:2）。

It’s sort of prophetic what our Lutheran brothers said about the newly introduced law of celibacy that came into Germany 400 years before the Reformation. Our Lutheran brothers stated that “While God’s commandment is in force, and the custom of the Church is well known, impure celibacy will cause scandals, adulteries, and other crimes that deserve punishment from just rulers.” (American Catholics finally broke their silence [at least a fraction of them did] in regards to the repeated child molestations and homosexual behavior, which is rampant amongst RC clergy.) The purifiers of the Church catholic warned of this day in the Augsburg Confession.

我们的路德宗弟兄对独身的新规定的看法具有预言性，这种独身规定在改教前400年进入德国。我们的路德宗弟兄们说“是尽管有神的命令，尽管教会的传统尽人皆知，不纯洁的独身会产生很多丑闻、淫乱和犯罪，这些都是应该受到正直审判官的惩罚的。”（美国天主教最终因为神职人员中间接二连三的骚扰儿童和同性恋而沉不住气[至少他们中一部分是这样]）。那些改革天主教的通过奥格斯堡自白给今天留下了告诫。

In light of all this, the Lutheran fathers say that “It is incredibly cruel to forbid something that God decreed to be most honorable, stating that even the heathens hold marriage as sacred. But now men, even priests, are cruelly put to death, contrary to the intent of canon law, for no other reason than that they are married. Paul, in I Timothy 4, says that it’s the doctrine of demons that forbids marriage (vv. 1-3). This is clearly seen by how laws against marriage are enforced with such penalties.

鉴于所有这些，路德宗前辈说“禁止神所看为宝贵的是何等的残酷，况且连外邦人都视婚姻为神圣。但是现在人，甚至是教牧，确单单因为婚姻被判了死刑，这违背了教会法则的初衷。保罗，在提摩太前书4章说禁止嫁娶是魔鬼的道理（vv. 1-3）。这让我们清楚的看到禁止婚姻的律法是靠这样的刑罚来维持的。
