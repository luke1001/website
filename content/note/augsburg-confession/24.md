Of Free Will they teach that man's will has some liberty to choose civil righteousness, and to work things subject to reason. But it has no power, without the Holy Spirit, to work the righteousness of God, that is, spiritual righteousness; since the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2:14; but this righteousness is wrought in the heart when the Holy Spirit is received http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php - article18.4through the Word. These things are said in as many words by Augustine in his Hypognosticon, Book III: We grant that all men have a free will, free, inasmuch as it has the judgment of reason; not that it is thereby capable, without God, either to begin, or, at least, to complete aught in things pertaining to God, but only in works of this life, whether good or evil. "Good" I call those works which spring from the good in nature, such as, willing to labor in the field, to eat and drink, to have a friend, to clothe oneself, to build a house, to marry a wife, to raise cattle, to learn diverse useful arts, or whatsoever good pertains to this life. For all of these things are not without dependence on the providence of God; yea, of Him and through Him they are and have their being. "Evil" http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php - article18.7I call such works as willing to worship an idol, to commit murder, etc.

论到自由意志，他们教导人：人的意志在履行世人之义并在选择理智以内的事上有一定自由。但没有上帝的圣灵，人的意志就没有能力行上帝的义或属灵的义；因为属血气的人不领会上帝圣灵的事（林前2：14）。但人藉着道接受了上帝的圣灵，才有这义产生在心里。奥古斯丁（Augustine）在他书上（Hypognosticon, Book Ⅲ）曾用以下的话讲论这些事：“我们承认一切的人都有一个自由意志，这意志确有理智的判断力；但这不是说，人若没有上帝，自己却能开始或实行属乎上帝的事，而是说，他只能行属乎今世的事，不论是善的恶的。所谓善事，我的意思是指属乎本能的善；譬如定意在田地上劳苦工作，想吃想喝，想交朋友，想得衣裳，想盖房子，娶妻，喂牲畜，学各种有益的技术，想得属乎今世的任何有益之事！这一切都由上帝管理；不但由祂管理，而且从祂而来，因祂而有。所谓恶事，我是指定意拜偶像，定意杀人，等类之事。”

Article XVIII, “Of Free Will” picks up where Article II “Original Sin” left off. If you recall our lesson on article II it said this:

文章 18, “关于自由意志” 是接着 文章 2 “原罪” 来说.。回忆我们在第二课是这样讲的:

• In this article, the forefathers of the Lutheran church have made the clear proclamation that our will, from the moment of conception is held in slavery to the devil. In other words, we are spiritual slaves who cannot break the chains of sin on our own power.

在这篇文章中, 路德宗教会的前辈作了很清楚的声明，我们的意志，自从产生以来就是在恶者的奴役之下的。换句话说，我们在属灵意义上是奴隶，凭自己的力量无法挣开罪的捆绑。

After making this very important distinction, that article of faith show a whole variety of Scripture passages that attest to this very important truth, that we are held in slavery to the devil until faith breaks that bond through the working of the Holy Spirit through the power of the gospel.

有了这个重要的认识之后, 那篇文章也列举了很多的经文来证明这个非常重要的真理，就是我们被恶者奴役直到信心藉圣灵用福音的大能来斩断这锁链。

The question that our article today takes up is this: Do we have any will at all when we begin life and if so, what are the functions of that will that we have? These are the questions are article now addresses.

我们今天的文章带来的是这个问题: 当我们出生的时候我们有任何的意志吗？如果是这样, 我们的那些意志都有什么用呢? 这正是我们所要探讨的问题。

First – Let’s take up the matter of man’s will in relationship to matters of reason and intellect.

首先 – 让我们从理性和智慧与人的意志的关系来看

Man is capable of making certain rational decisions. But what kind?

人是有能力对一些事作出合理的决策的。但都有哪些呢?

In External matters only! Not spiritual matters Read the following…

只有一些外在的事情! 不是属灵的事。 阅读下面经文…

I Corinthians 2:14 “The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.”

哥林多前书 2:14 “然而属血气的人不领会神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙。并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。”

Ephesians 2:1 “As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins.”

以弗所书 2:1 “你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来”

1. What do these two passages tell us about man’s ability to come to God or understand the things of God, like his love to us in Christ Jesus?

    这两段告诉我们人有没有能力去认识寻求神并理解神的事，比如神在基督耶稣里给我们的爱？

    The ancient heresy that crept into the church near the time period of Augustine (around AD 300) was that of the Pelagians. We looked at them in article II regarding original sin and how Pelagius taught that man has some ability of good in him to decide righteous things apart from the Spirit of God giving him that ability. Augustine was a staunch opponent of Pelagius and taught rightly from Scripture that man has no ability, due to his original sin, to cooperate in spiritual matters with God.

    古时有教会里蔓延一种异端，是大约在奥古斯丁的时代 (公元 300年前后) 的伯拉纠派. 我们看到在文章 2里提到原罪和伯拉纠派是如何教导人们人都有有上天赐予的一定能力去分辨善恶的。 奥古斯丁是伯拉纠派坚定的反对者并且依据圣经作出了正确的教导，人因为自己的原罪是没有能力在属灵的事上和神同工的。

    Yet, our article today says, “Man’s will has some liberty.” Take note of the word “some” because it is not insinuating that we control our own destiny by the actions of our life. In small areas God might allow our decisions to affect circumstances in our life, but God has our entire road map planned out for us well before we even make any of those decisions. Consider the story of his shepherd Cyrus that he raises up to bring back the people of Israel from their captivity with the Babylonians…

    我们今天的文章也谈到, “人的意志是有一些自由的” 注意这个词“一些”， 因为那不是在暗示说我们可以通过自己的行为来掌控自己的命运。在一些小事上神可能会允许我们自己做一些决定来部分影响自己生命中的环境，但甚至在我们自己作出任何决定之前神已经预先定好了我们的道路。想一下神为了将以色列人从巴比伦被掳之地带回而立的居鲁士王（古列王）的故事吧。

    Isaiah 44:24-28 24 “This is what the LORD says—  your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb:  I am the LORD, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself, 25 who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense, 26 who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ of the towns of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt,’ and of their ruins, ‘I will restore them,’ 27 who says to the watery deep, ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,’ 28 who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.”’

    以赛亚书 44:24-28 从你出胎，造就你的救赎主耶和华如此说，我耶和华是创造万物的，是独自铺张诸天，铺开大地的。（谁与我同在呢）25 使说假话的兆头失效，使占卜的癫狂，使智慧人退后，使他的知识变为愚拙。26 使我仆人的话语立定，我使者的谋算成就。论到耶路撒冷说，必有人居住。论到犹大的城邑说，必被建造。其中的荒场我也必兴起。27 对深渊说，你干了吧。我也要使你的江河干涸。28 论古列说，他是我的牧人，必成就我所喜悦的，必下令建造耶路撒冷，发令立稳圣殿的根基。

2. When did our form take shape and who shaped it?

    我们的形状样式是谁在什么时候就定好了的呢?

3. Who destroys the plans of the wicked and makes fools out of fortune tellers?

    谁毁坏恶人的计谋并愚弄那说假话的人?

4. Who brings prophecy to fulfillment?

    谁能使预言成就呢?

5. Who rebuilds Jerusalem at the very time that he says it will be rebuilt?

    谁重建了耶路撒冷城并且正好是在祂所说的必要重建的那个时候呢?

6. Who names the unborn King who will one day be instrumental in rebuilding God’s city?

    谁给未出生的君王的起了名字，就是那个日后要被使用来重建上帝之城的王?

    Consider the words of the apostle James in this regards…

    看看使徒雅各所提到的话吧…

    James 4:13-15 Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” 14 Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. 15Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”

    雅各书 4:13-15 你们有话说，今天明天我们要往某城里去，在那里住一年，作买卖得利。14 其实明天如何，你们还不知道。你们的生命是什么呢。你们原来是一片云雾，出现少时就不见了。15 你们只当说，主若愿意，我们就可以活着，也可以作这事，或作那事。

7. What insight does the apostle James give to us about our ability to choose certain external things in life?

    我们从使徒雅各所说的关于“我们生活选择一些外在东西的能力”有什么看见呢?

    Our article says that “man’s will has some liberty to choose civil righteousness.” Phillip Melanchthon’s defense of the Augsburg Confession goes into greater detail what they mean by this, but basically they are saying that man has the ability to obey governing authorities or to disobey them; obey parents or disobey them. We have the ability to choose to harm someone physically or emotionally and we have the ability to restrain ourselves from doing this and this is the natural law at work in our hearts that is given to every creature born.

    我们的文章说到 “人的意志是有一定自由能选择民事公义” ，墨兰顿（Phillip Melanchthon）为奥格斯堡信纲的辩护对这一点作了更细致的阐述, 但他们主要还是说人有遵行或悖逆政府权柄和法令的能力; 或者是顺从或悖逆自己的父母。我们有能力去选择伤害别人我们也有能力控制自己不这么做，这些是给所有受造的生命在心里的自然规律。

    It’s important that we point out right here that human beings love the civic righteousness of this world and in a sense it becomes the religion of every human being outside of the true faith only found in Christianity. Consider the following words from wise King Solomon…

    我们在这里指出非常重要的一点就是人们爱世上的道德公义标准，而在某种意义上它成为了没有真正信心—只有基督教才有—的所有人的宗教。仔细思想所罗门王智慧的话语吧…

    Proverbs 16:25 - There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

    箴言 16:25 -有一条路，人以为正，至终成为死亡之路。

    ![](/images/note/ags/24-2.jpg#center)

    Give three examples of ways that “Seems Right” to a person. Use the pictures for help.

    举3个对人来说 “看起来很对”的例子。可以用图画来帮助。

1)

2)

3)

1. Why doesn’t this sort of civic righteousness make us right with God?

    为什么这些道德律法不能使我们在神面前也显为公义?

It’s important that we understand that civic righteousness remains an external thing only, without any spiritual value to us at all. It may keep and prosper peace for society…but it doesn’t take care of sin factor that separates each of us from God. For Isaiah writes…

我们能够理解“世人的公义标准只能停留在外在的东西”这点非常重要, 因为它对我们而言是完全没有属灵上的价值的。它可能保持社会的平稳发展…但它不能处理使我们与神隔离的罪的元素。以赛亚书写到…

Isaiah 59:2 But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.

以赛亚书 59:2 但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝，你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。2

![](/images/note/ags/24-3.jpg#right)

Only in Jesus does a sinner have his iniquities covered.

Only in Jesus does a sinner have a bridge extending to God.

只有在基督耶稣里罪人的罪孽被遮盖。

只有在基督耶稣里一个罪人才能与神相通。

1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

提摩太前书 2:5 因为只有一位神，在神和人中间，只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的基督耶稣。

As the Apology to the Augsburg Confession states: “For human hearts without the Holy Spirit are without the fear of God; without trust toward God…Therefore they are godless.”

如奥格斯堡信纲里辩护书所说: “没有圣灵的人心是不畏神的; 没有对神的信靠…因此他们是不信神的。”

Because civic righteousness is the first religion born in man, it is important that we guard ourselves from this religion, even as Christians, lest we forfeit the free grace that God has given us in Jesus Christ. Read the following…

因为世上的道德公义是人出生的第一本性, 所以我们保守自己免于沉溺这种信仰是很重要的, 虽然你已经是基督徒, 以免我们失落了神在耶稣基督里给我们的自由恩典。读下面的经文…

![](/images/note/ags/24-4.jpg#right)

Luke 18:9-14 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’  13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ 14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

路加福音 18:9-14----耶稣向那些仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，10 说，有两个人上殿里去祷告。一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。11 法利赛人站着，自言自语的祷告说，神阿，我感谢你，我不像别人，勒索，不义，奸淫，也不像这个税吏。12 我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的，都捐上十分之一。13 那税吏远远的站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说，神阿，开恩可怜我这个罪人。14 我告诉你们，这人回家去，比那人倒算为义了，因为凡自高的，必降为卑，自卑的，必升为高。

Consider what took place with the church at Galatia…

再想想发生在加拉太教会的事…

Galatians 1:6-9 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! 9 As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

加拉太书 1:6-9 我希奇你们这麽快离开那藉着基督之恩召你们的，去从别的福音。7 那并不是福音不过有些人搅扰你们，要把基督的福音更改了。8 但无论是我们，是天上来的使者，若传福音给你们，与我们所传给你们的不同，他就应当被咒诅。9 我们已经说了，现在又说，若有人传福音给你们，与你们所领受的不同，他就应当被咒诅。

God wants to have mercy; yet man in his hostile nature that is at war with God from conception desires merit! But herein lies the clash between us and God. Can natural man really produce anything worthwhile in God’s sight apart from Christ Jesus our Lord? The answer is no, and the following passages add emphasis to this “No.” Read the following…

神想要施怜悯与我们; 但是人有敌对的天性就是为了渴求利益而与上帝征战! 这里就产生了人与神的冲突。人凭着自己能真正做出从神看来是有意义的事么? 答案是否, 而以下文段也都证实了这个“否” 。 读下面文段…

1 Corinthians 12:3 Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

哥林多前书 12:3 所以我告诉你们，被神的灵感动的，没有说耶稣是可咒诅的。若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说耶稣是主的。

John 15:5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.

约翰福音 15:5 我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能作什么。

Philippians 2:13 for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.

腓立比书 2:13 因为你们立志行事，都是神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。

Romans 9:16 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.

罗马书 9:16 据此看来，这不在乎那定意的，也不在乎那奔跑的，只在乎发怜悯的神。

Scripture calls natural man “blind” and “dead in trespasses and sin.” Whenever faith exists in the heart of a person, it exists only because it is worked in the heart of that person by the Holy Spirit through the power of the gospel.

经文提到普通人是“瞎眼的” 和 “死在过犯中的”。 当对神的信存在于人心的时候, 那信之所以能存在也是因为借着福音的力量，圣灵的做工。

After faith is born in the heart of a person, then the person is no longer dominated by the old sinful flesh and can make God-pleasing decisions in accord with the will of God. Read the following…

当人心中产生了对神的信仰, 这个人就不再被老我的罪身所辖制，而是按神的心意行神所喜悦的事。读下面经文…

2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

哥林多后书 3:17 主就是那灵。主的灵在那里，那里就得以自由。

John 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

约翰福音 8:36 所以天父的儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。


第二部分

They condemn the Pelagians and others, who teach that without the Holy Spirit, by the power of nature alone, we are able to love God above all things; also to do the commandments of God as touching "the substance of the act." For, although nature is able in a manner to do the outward work, (for it is able to keep the hands from theft and murder,) yet it cannot produce the inward motions, such as the fear of God, trust in God, chastity, patience, etc.

他们弃绝伯拉纠派一类的异端，他们教导人说，单凭本能，不需上帝的圣灵，我们能爱上帝过于万物：并说照行为的实质，我们能遵守上帝的诫命。因为人的本性虽然能行某种外表的善（如：能制止自己偷窃，不杀人），但不能做内在的工作，如敬畏上帝，信赖上帝，贞洁，忍耐等等。
