Of the Worship of Saints they teach that the memory of saints may be set before us, that we may follow their faith and good works, according to our calling, as the Emperor may follow the example of David in making war to drive away the Turk from his country.  For both are kings. But the Scripture teaches not the invocation of saints or to ask help of saints, since it sets before us the one Christ as the Mediator, Propitiation, High Priest, and Intercessor.  He is to be prayed to, and has promised that He will hear our prayer; and this worship He approves above all, to wit, that in all afflictions He be called upon, 1 John 2:1:  If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, etc.  

关于敬拜圣徒他们教导圣徒可以做我们的参考，各人可以根据自己的呼召来效法圣徒的信心和好行为，正如君王效法大卫王争战驱逐土耳其人一样。因为他们都是君王。但是圣经不是教导我们去向圣徒祷告或求告圣徒，因为清楚的摆在我们面前的是基督是我们的中保、挽回祭、大祭司和代求者。我们祷告的对象是他，并特别喜悦一种敬拜，就是要人在诸般患难中求告他。约翰一书2：1：若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督，等等。

#### Mediator 中保

On December 13, 1545, a few months before Luther’s death, the Roman Catholic Church met in council at the city of Trent to discuss the worship of saints. They concluded their meetings by saying that it is an “impious” thought if anyone rejects the invocation of the saints. So according to their own words, they say that we need the service of mediators in order to have access to the merits of our Savior. This deposes Jesus from his throne as our only mediator, in spite of the fact that they may still call Jesus our Mediator.

在1545年12月13号也就是路德归天前几个月，罗马天主教在特伦特市开会讨论关于敬拜圣徒的问题。他们会以的讨论结果就是如果有人拒绝向圣徒求告那就是不恭不敬。他们自己说人需要中保才能到神面前来。尽管他们还称耶稣是中保，但这实际上是对主耶稣唯一中保地位的弃绝。

Only ONE Mediator

只有一位中保

1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus.

提摩太前书 2:5 因为只有一位神，在神和人中间，只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的基督耶稣。

The Roman Catholic Church makes the same grievous error that all false religions make – the idea that we must first give God something before he will grant us the forgiveness for our sins. The reality, however, is that this action is what makes man as Scripture calls him, “hostile” to God. They are his number one enemy if they think they can achieve grace through a different source of mediation outside of Jesus Christ. Read the following…

罗马天主教犯了其它异端所犯的严重的错误—就是我们必须奉献给神一些东西然后神才能饶恕我们的罪。事实上，圣经上称这样的人是与神为敌的。如果他们认为自己除了中保耶稣外可以另辟蹊径到神的面前那么他们就是神最大的敌人。请读以下经文…

John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

约翰福音 14:6 耶稣说，我就是道路，真理，生命。若不藉着我。没有人能到父那里去。

Jesus himself teaches us that to call on any saint to make intercession for us would clearly violate the sole mediatorship of Jesus. Saints do not, like Jesus, stand between us and God. They are our brethren, who like us have been reconciled to God by the mediatorship of Jesus. Jesus redeemed them every bit as much as he had redeemed us. They had their life in Jesus even as we have life in Jesus.

耶稣清楚的教导我们求告圣徒的名让圣徒做中保是违背耶稣是唯一中保原则的。圣徒并不是跟耶稣一样站在我们跟神之间的。他们是我们的弟兄跟我们一样通过中保耶稣得以来到神面前的。耶稣怎样救赎了他们也怎样救赎了我们。他们的生命在耶稣里我们的生命也在耶稣里。

How then do we honor the saints properly? Our article of faith states that we may follow their faith and good works. Read the following…

我们应该如何以正确的态度来尊敬圣徒呢？本篇认为我们应该去效法他们的信心和好行为。请读以下经文…

Hebrews 13:7 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.

希伯来书 13:7 从前引导你们，传神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。

Our forefathers sight the example of Emperor Charles V as an example of a man who could follow the pattern of the saints of old. Charles the V, as Holy Roman Emperor could follow the example of the ancient king of Israel, King David who protected his people from the harm of their enemies – sometimes at the cost of human life. Well, the Turks were threatening the empire and moving in as far as Vienna, so Charles was being applauded for behaving like the saint of the past, King David, for protecting the empire – at all costs. That’s a proper way to use the saints of the past, but to pray for intercession is simply unbiblical and idolatrous.

我们的前辈们视查尔斯五世为效法古圣徒的楷模。查尔斯五世作为罗马皇帝能够效法古代以色列君王大卫王保护子民免受敌人之害—有时候甚至以流血为代价。当时土耳其人长驱直入直抵维也纳威胁帝国存亡，所有查尔斯受命像古圣徒大卫王一样去保卫帝国—不惜一切代价。这是正确对待古圣徒的方式，但是求中保是完全没有圣经根据的迷信。

In a similar view, God has imposed on each of us, a set of talents by which he wants each of us to exercise these talents in life to the best of our God-given abilities and when we do so, we are behaving like the saints of old and honoring their legacy as children of God, bought by the blood of their Redeemer.

同样的，神也给我们每个人不同的恩赐，神要我们使用这些恩赐使这些恩赐能够在我们身上成为能力，当我们这样做的时候，我们就是在效法圣徒和尊敬他们也就是救主宝血买回的神的儿女所留给我们的。

This brings us to the close of the doctrinal part of the Augsburg Confession. Our fathers added the following conclusion:

这就是我们奥格斯堡自白教义部分的结尾。我们的前辈们做了以下的结论：

This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers. This being the case, they judge harshly who insist that our teachers be regarded as heretics. There is, however, disagreement on certain abuses, which have crept into the Church without rightful authority. And even in these, if there were some difference, there should be proper lenity on the part of bishops to bear with us by reason of the Confession which we have now reviewed; because even the Canons are not so severe as to demand the same rites everywhere, neither, at any time, have the rites of all churches been the same;  although, among us, in large part, the ancient rites are diligently observed.  For it is a false and malicious charge that all the ceremonies, all the things instituted of old, are abolished in our churches.  But it has been a common complaint that some abuses were connected with the ordinary rites. These, inasmuch as they could not be approved with a good conscience, have been to some extent corrected.

这是关于我们教义的总纲，在其中我们可以看出没有什么违背圣经，或违背天主教，也不违反著述家（古教父的著述）所传下来的罗马教会。这样，他们那些认为我们的教师是异端的就是吹毛求疵了。但这次所争论的乃是关于一些无可靠根据而混入了教会的遗传和弊端；在这些事上纵有分歧，但众主教若因现在所呈上的信条而容忍我们，这就是他们应有的宽洪之德，因为教条上也不强求各处的礼仪必须一致，而各教会的礼仪无论在那一时代也没有一致的。况且我们仍然殷勤遵守大半的古礼，因为控告我们教会废弃一切礼仪和古时所设立一切制度的，乃是诬陷我们。但民间所抱怨的乃是与通用礼仪相连的一些弊端。这些弊端既不能凭着良心承认，就多少已加改正了。
