Our teachers are falsely accused of forbidding Good Works.  For their published writings on the Ten Commandments, and others of like import, bear witness that they have taught to good purpose concerning all estates and duties of life, as to what estates of life and what works in every calling be pleasing to God.  Concerning these things preachers heretofore taught but little, and urged only childish and needless works, as particular holy-days, particular fasts, brotherhoods, pilgrimages, services in honor of saints, the use of rosaries, monasticism, and such like.  Since our adversaries have been admonished of these things, they are now unlearning them, and do not preach these unprofitable works as heretofore.   Besides, they begin to mention faith, of which there was heretofore marvelous silence.   They teach that we are justified not by works only, but they conjoin faith and works, and say that we are justified by faith and works.  This doctrine is more tolerable than the former one, and can afford more consolation than their old doctrine.

我们的老师被错误的控告说他们是禁止好行为的。因为我们教会讲论十诫和其他同等性质之书，可以证明我们对于各种职务及其责任曾有益地教导人：何种职务及每一种职务中何种行为乃是上帝所喜悦的。这些事，从前的传道人很少或完全没有教导过人；他们只劝人行愚昧无益的事，如遵守规定的节期，按期禁食，设立会社，朝圣，敬拜古圣，用念珠，修道等类的事。那些抵挡我们的人，因得了警告，现在也弃绝这些事，不如往常一样传讲这些无益之事。另外，他们也开始提及信心，但之前信心是从来不提的。他们教导称义不是完全因为行为，他们把信心和行为结合在一起说称义是既靠信心也靠行为。这种教导比之前的更容易让人接受，也比之前的更能安慰人心.

Forasmuch, therefore, as the doctrine concerning faith, which ought to be the chief one in the Church, has lain so long unknown, as all must needs grant that there was the deepest silence in their sermons concerning the righteousness of faith, while only the doctrine of works was treated in the churches, our teachers have instructed the churches concerning faith as follows:—

鉴于关于信心的教导本应在教会居首位但却长期以来不被人知，关于因信称义在他们的讲道中从来都只字不提在教会中所提的只是行为的教导，我们的老师关于信心是这样教导教会的：--

Notes:

注：

This introduction sets forth the reasons why this Article is presented as one of special importance. First, there is the false charge against our teachers that they forbid good works. The fact is that they have been diligently urging and teaching good works, according to the Ten Commandments of God.

这段简介告诉我们为什么这篇文章特别重要。第一，有人错误指责我们的老师禁止好行为。事实上他们一直在根据十诫鼓励和教导人有好行为。

![](/images/note/ags/26-1.jpg#right)

Second off, the Lutheran teachers point out the fact that the Catholic Church had woefully neglected the teachings of true good works to God amongst their people. Through their pilgrimages, and rosarys and other external works that were not commanded by God, they were falsely teaching what true good works are before God.

第二，路德宗前辈们指出天主教令人遗憾的忽略了对真正的好行为的教导。他们教导的朝圣和念珠祷告和其它的外在行为并不是神的命令，他们关于神眼中的好行为的教导是错误的。

Then, there is the fact that the opponents in the Catholic Church were now starting to talk about “faith,” as though “faith” had been a big part of their religion. The reality is that is wasn’t a big part of their religion until the Reformation. But even after “faith” started to come up in their discussions because of the protest of the “protestants,” even then, they falsely taught that faith and works save a man.

事实是这样的天主教的对手开始谈论信心好像信心是他们信仰的重要部分。事实上直到改教之前信心在他们信仰中根本都不重要。即便因为新教徒的反对他们开始谈论信心，他们还是错误的教导信心和行为加一起使人得救。

Now the followers of Luther lay out a presentation of the way in which the doctrine of faith and good works is taught in our churches.

接下来路德的跟随者向大家展示我们教会是如何教导信心和好行为的。

#### A. By Faith Alone Are We Reconciled to God 我们被神接受是单单因着信

First, that our works cannot reconcile God or merit forgiveness of sins, grace, and justification, but that we obtain this only by faith when we believe that we are received into favor for Christ's sake, who alone has been set forth the Mediator and Propitiation, 1 Tim. 2:5, in order that the Father may be reconciled through Him. Whoever, therefore, trusts that by works he merits grace, despises the merit and grace of Christ, and seeks a way to God without Christ, by human strength, although Christ has said of Himself: I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. John 14:6.

首先，靠我们的行为不能使神接受我们或赢得赦罪、恩典和称义，我们得到这些东西是单单因着我们蒙神喜悦是因基督的缘故，他是我们的中保和赎罪祭，提前2:5 在神和人中间，只有一位中保。所以若有人相信自己的行为可以赢得恩典的话就是在藐视神的救恩了，是企图通过人的办法而不是基督来到神的面前，尽管神曾经说到他自己：我就是道路，真理，生命。约翰福音14:6.

This doctrine concerning faith is everywhere treated by Paul, Eph. 2:8: By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of your selves; it is the gift of God, not of works, etc. And lest any one should craftily say that a new interpretation of Paul has been devised by us, this entire matter is supported by the testimonies of the Fathers. For Augustine, in many volumes, defends grace and the righteousness of faith, over against the merits of works.  And Ambrose, in his De Vocatione Gentium, and elsewhere, teaches to like effect. For in his De Vocatione Gentium he says as follows: Redemption by the blood of Christ would become of little value, neither would the preeminence of man's works be superseded by the mercy of God, if justification, which is wrought through grace, were due to the merits going before, so as to be, not the free gift of a donor, but the reward due to the laborer.

唯恐有些人会狡辩说我们对保罗的话的解释是杜撰的，其实从我们的前辈的见证中可以找到这样的证据。因为奥古斯丁在多卷书中为恩典和因信称义辩护，反对因行为称义。圣安波罗修在他异邦人蒙召（De Vocatione Gentium）及其他书上也有这样的教训；因为他论异邦人蒙召如此说：“倘若称义不在乎恩典，而在乎先有善功，那么基督以血所作成的救赎就算不得什么，人善功的权利也容不下上帝的恩慈，这样，称义就不算是施主的慷慨，而不过是雇工的工价。

![](/images/note/ags/26-2.jpg#right)

Notes: Christ is our only Mediator, who by his death merited for us the forgiveness of our sins. Any attempt, therefore, on our part to merit the favor of God, in whole or in part, is really nothing else than a setting aside of the merits of Christ. It means either that we do not trust Christ or that we despise his efforts to save us. Although he proclaims himself as the true way of life, we refuse to travel that road, and map out a way of our own.

注：基督是我们唯一的中保，因着他的死我们的罪被赦免。我们若尝试靠自己去赢得神的一点或完全喜悦，这不是别的乃是遗弃基督的功劳了。这样就是说我们不相信基督或我们藐视他救赎的大功。尽管他说自己是生命的真道，然而我们他这条路而另辟蹊径。

Therefore, when Lutheran teachers direct their people to seek salvation alone through faith in Jesus, they are not intending to nullify the importance of good works, but rather, they are showing a person what Scripture reveals to us about acquiring salvation.

因此，当路德宗前辈们教导人们单单靠着在基督里的信来寻求救恩时，他们目的并不是要否认好行为的重要性，而是要告诉人们关于得救圣经是如何教导的。

Ephesians 2:8,9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书 2:8,9 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信，这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的。也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

![](/images/note/ags/26-4.jpg#right)

If someone were to imagine that there was something more required of him, rather than a simple faith or trust in the merits of Jesus Christ, they are just imagining this. The Bible teaches us that we can’t earn or add anything to grace, which is God’s undeserved love to sinners, which is why Paul writes, “And this not from yourselves…” Paul concludes by saying, “So that no one will boast." The reason Paul writes this is because our sinful human nature would like to try and take a little bit of credit or honor for our salvation. This spirit of the Pharisee, must be continually put down through repentance so that nothing else remains besides faith in Jesus’ merits alone.

如果有人感觉除了简单的相信耶稣基督的救赎大功外自己还要做什么才可以，那他们就是在凭空想象了。圣经告诉我们说我们既不能赚得恩典也不能加添恩典，这是神给罪人的他们本不配得的爱。这也是保罗为什么说“这并不是出于自己…”保罗总结说“免得有人自夸。” 保罗写这个的原因是因为我们罪身总是要把得救的一部分功劳或荣耀归于自己。这种法利赛人的思想必须靠着悔改不断地被对付直到我们单单的相信耶稣的救赎大功。

![](/images/note/ags/26-5.jpg#right)

The early Christian Church taught the same as the Lutherans were now concluding from Scripture in this regards, which is why they now quote some of the early church fathers.

早期基督教会跟路德宗根据圣经所教导的是相同的，这也是为什么要引用一些教会前辈的观点。

Augustine (died in A.D. 430) and Ambrose (died in 384) are mentioned as witnesses. Both of these church fathers look to Paul’s words in Romans 11:6, “If by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.”

奥古斯丁（死于430年）和安布罗斯（死于384年）作为见证人被提起。这两个教会前辈都依照保罗在罗马书11:6 的话“既是出于恩典，就不在乎行为。不然，恩典就不是恩典了。”

• It was important for the protestants of the Roman Catholic Church to use every resource at their disposal. First the Scriptures, then the church fathers, so that they could show Rome and others that the Lutheran church is not a “new” church with new doctrines, but is rather a continuation of the old and ancient church founded by Christ Jesus and the apostles.
新教徒应该利用可利用的一切资源。首先是圣经其次是教会前辈，为的是让罗马教会和其他人知道路德宗教会不是有新教导的“新”教会，而是对基督和使徒建立的古时教会的继承。

#### B. This doctrine is Rich in Comfort 这教导满有安慰

But, although this doctrine is despised by the inexperienced, nevertheless God-fearing and anxious consciences find by experience that it brings the greatest consolation, because consciences cannot be set at rest through any works, but only by faith, when they take the sure ground that for Christ's sake they have a reconciled God. As Paul teaches Rom. 5:1: http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php - article20.16Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.  This whole doctrine is to be referred to that conflict of the terrified conscience, neither can it be understood apart from that conflict. Therefore inexperienced and profane men judge ill concerning this matter, who dream that Christian righteousness is nothing but civil and philosophical righteousness.

这一个教理虽被没有经验的人所藐视，但敬虔和心怀忧惧的人从经验上觉得这教理能赐给人大大的安慰：因为无论靠什么善功良心总得不着平安，单因信才能得着，就是他们确实相信他们有一位上帝，因基督的缘故而得以相和了；正如保罗的教训罗5:1：“我们既因信称义，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督得与上帝相和”。这教理全是关乎不安良心的冲突，惟有良心觉得了这种冲突，才能领会这道理。所以凡在这事上没有经验和属乎世俗的人，梦想基督教的义不过是世俗和哲理的义，他们乃是拙于判断这事的人。

Heretofore consciences were plagued with the doctrine of works, they did not hear the consolation from the Gospel.  Some persons were driven by conscience into the desert, into monasteries hoping there to merit grace by a monastic life.  Some also devised other works whereby to merit grace and make satisfaction for sins.  Hence there was very great need to treat of, and renew, this doctrine of faith in Christ, to the end that anxious consciences should not be without consolation but that they might know that grace and forgiveness of sins and justification are apprehended by faith in Christ.

从前人的良心被善功的教理搅扰得不安；他们没有听见过从福音而来的安慰。有的人为良心所驱逐，逃到旷野和修道院，指望在那些地方藉着修道博取上帝的恩典。有的又造作别类善功，想赚恩补罪。所以现在很需要传讲并恢复这信基督的教理，好使忧惧的良心不至缺少安慰，可以知道恩典，赦罪，称义乃是因信基督而得来。


![](/images/note/ags/26-6.jpg#right)

Augustine once wrote, “Our heart is restless until it rests in you.”

奥古斯丁曾经写道，“除了在你里面我们的心没有安息。”

Lutherans believe that once the soul has come to realize that out of his/her heart, only evil can be produced, evil that is deserving of God’s eternal wrath and displeasure that that soul will ultimately fright with terror! His conscience has convicted him and put him in a posture where he is now afraid of Almighty God…

路德宗相信一旦灵魂认识到从人心里出来的尽都是恶，结局是神永远的怒气和厌弃的恶，那么灵魂最终会恐惧战兢！他的良心会控告他使他畏惧全能的上帝…

But then comes faith, and points us to the object of God’s anger and the object of God’s love, the Lord Jesus Christ. It’s God’s object of anger because he took out on his Son the punishment that we deserved for sin. He’s the object of God’s love because he is his only begotten Son, and he has displayed his Son’s cross for the whole world to see his great love for sinners.

但是随之而来的信心使我们转向神的怒气和爱共同所指的主耶稣基督。他是神的怒气的所指因为神差派他的儿子为我们的罪担当了刑罚。他是神的爱的所指是因为他是神的独生子，神的爱藉着爱子为世人钉十字架就向罪人显明了。

Our Lutheran confessions say that it’s an anxious conscience, which realizes that it cannot be set at rest through any works whatsoever because our works cannot atone for one single sin that we have committed. But when that heart rests in the promise of God that proclaims full forgivenss to us through the cross, then that heart as St. Augustine once said, finds not only rest, but also a firm ground to stand on because for Christ’s sake, we have been reconciled to God and our sins no longer count against us.

我们的路德宗信条认为我们的不安的良心认识到任何行为都不能使之得安慰，行为连一条我们所犯的罪都不能赎。但是我们的心因为藉着十架向我们宣告完全赦免的神的应许得到安慰，我们的心就如圣奥古斯丁曾经说过的，不仅得到安慰，而且因为基督的缘故而站立得稳，神已经接纳我们也不再纠察我们的罪了。

Anyone who believes that Christian righteousness is nothing but a civil and philosophical thing, that is, an outwardly honorable and respectable life, do not realize the power of God in the gospel. Read the following…

认为基督徒的称义不过是一个非宗教的哲学上的概念，也就是一种外在的尊贵高尚的生活的人，是没有认识到神在福音中的大能。请读以下经文…

Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.

罗马书 1:16 我不以福音为耻。这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希利尼人。

1 Corinthians 2:2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.

哥林多前书 2:2 因为我曾定了主意，在你们中间不知道别的，只知道耶稣基督，并他钉十字架。

Not only is the Biblical doctrine of Faith in Jesus saving us from our sins the position of Lutheran teachers, but it is the only doctrine that will provide the human soul with complete joy and consolation. Just imagine being in a hospital, with only weeks left to live…and yet the church was telling you to place your trust in your earthly life and all of the good that you did for others. Is there any hope there at all? No, but imagine the church bringing you the message of the gospel, “It is finished!” Jesus said. You’re not going to die, but will live forever through faith in the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, there’s where the comfort is!

圣经关于在耶稣里的信心的真理救我们脱离我们的罪，正如路德宗老师所教导的一样，它也是唯一能给人的灵魂带来完全的喜乐和安慰的真理。想象一下你现在住院，只剩几周的存活时间了…教会告诉你的寄托都放在地上的生活和你做的善事上。这样有希望吗？没有的，再想象如果教会带给你福音，“成了”耶稣说。你不是去死而是因着信主耶稣基督而得到永远的生命。这就是安慰的所在！

#### C. Faith Is Trust in Christ

Men are also admonished that here the term "faith" does not signify merely the knowledge of the history, such as is in the ungodly and in the devil, but signifies a faith which believes, not merely the history, but also the effect of the history—namely, this article: the forgiveness of sins, to wit, that we have grace, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins through Christ.

我们又教导人：这里所说“信”是名词，不是单指历史的知识，那种知识恶人和魔鬼也可以有；乃是指着不单信历史也是信那历史的功效，就是信那赦罪的条文：我们因基督可以有恩典，公义，赦免。

Now he that knows that he has a Father gracious to him through Christ, truly knows God; he knows also that God cares for him, and calls upon God; in a word, he is not  without God, as the heathen. For devils and the ungodly are not able to believe this article: the forgiveness of sins. Hence, they hate God as an enemy, call not upon Him,  and expect no good from Him. Augustine also admonishes his readers concerning the word "faith," and teaches that the term "faith" is accepted in the Scriptures not for knowledge such as is in the ungodly but for confidence which consoles and encourages the terrified mind.

这样，凡知道因基督而有一位仁慈天父的人，便真认识上帝；他知道上帝眷念他；他爱上帝呼吁上帝；一言以蔽之，他不像异邦人没有上帝。因为魔鬼和恶人断不能信这赦罪的条文，所以他们恨恶上帝如同仇敌，他们不呼吁他，不指望从他手里得什么好处。论到信的名词，奥古斯丁也这样劝勉读者，且教导人说，这信字在圣经上不是指着像恶人所有的那种知识，而是指着一种能以安慰鼓励忧惧者的信靠。

Notes: These words require no further comment except for a stress on the warning that we do not deceive ourselves, mistaking a head faith, which consists of knowledge only verses a genuine faith of the heart.

#### D. Good Works Must Follow Faith to the Praise of God

Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because it is the will of God.  It is only by faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for nothing.  And because through faith the Holy Spirit is received, hearts are renewed and endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good works.  For Ambrose says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing.  For man's powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly affections, and are too weak to do works which are good in God's sight.  Besides, they are in the power of the devil who impels men to divers sins, to ungodly opinions, to open crimes. This we may see in the philosophers, who, although they endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed,  but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs himself only by human strength.

再者，我们教会教导人必须行善，这并不是因为我们可靠行善配得恩典，而是因为行善乃是上帝的旨意。人单因信才得以赦罪蒙恩。而且既藉着信受了圣灵，我们的心就更新了，并有了新的情意，这样，才能行出善事来。因为安波罗修如此说：“信为善念善行之母”。因为，人的能力，没有圣灵，就充满了恶念，软弱无能，不能在上帝面前行善。并且他们是在魔鬼的权势之下，被激动行各样恶事，意念亵渎，作明显不法的事；例如许多文人哲士尽力想做诚信的人，非但做不到，反为许多明显不法的事玷污了。当人没有信，没有圣灵，并且除自己本性的能力外，没有别的引导，他便是如此的。

Notes:

注：

In Romans 3:31, Paul asks the question: “Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith?” And asnwers emphatically: “Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.”

在罗马书3:31 保罗问到这样一个问题“这样，我们因信废了神的律法么?”然后他斩钉截铁的回答：“断乎不是，更是坚固律法。”

![](/images/note/ags/26-7.jpg#right)

This is the point our forefathers now are making regarding faith and good works in Article XX. We teach people not to trust in their good works as meritorious. Yet, our Holy God desires our doing them. In fact, he commands them from us in his Holy Law.

这就是我们的前辈们关于第二十篇的信心好行为要说的。我们教导人不要看自己的好行为是功德。但是我们圣洁的神要我们有好的行为。事实上他在圣律中要我们这样做。

So, then, the very faith that receives full justification from God is now at the very same time interested and pleasing his Father in heaven by reading the word, praying to him, confessing sin, singing hymns of praise, helping our neighbor, spreading the gospel etc.

所以我们靠着称义的信心也同时通过读经、祷告、认罪、唱诗、帮助人、传福音等蒙天父的喜悦。

If a fruit tree fails to bring forth good fruit, that would be a sure sign that the tree is dead or dying. And the same is true with the child of God. If they fail to bring forth good fruit for the kingdom it is a sign that their faith is either dying or already dead. Because the nature of faith will always bring forth fruits of repentance.

如果果树不再结好果子，那么就证明这棵树已死或奄奄一息。对神的儿女也是同样的道理。如果神儿女没有天国的好果子，那就证明他们的信心奄奄一息或已死。因为信心会结出与悔改的心相称的果子来。

Consider the thief on the cross. He didn’t have much time to bear a whole lot of fruit…but if you remember some of his words that day, his fruit was in deed evident. Can you remember what he said?

想一下十字架上的强盗。他没有时间结出很多好的果子…如果你记得他那天所说的话就可以很容易的看到他的果子了。你记得他说什么吗？

Take a brief quiz and determine which statements are true and which are false:

简单测试分辨下列叙述对错：

---- Faith alone saves; good works don’t attribute even 1% to our salvation

-----单单是信心拯救人；我们得救连好行为1%的功劳都没有。

---- Good works are necessary because God commands them and they bring him honor

----好行为是必须的这是神的命令，好行为也荣耀神

---- Good works are necessary for salvation

----好行为是得救的必须

---- Christians do good works that they they can be saved

----基督徒有好行为是为了得救

---- Christians do good works because they are saved

----基督徒有好行为是因为他们已经得救

---- Faith is necessary for salvation – for none can be saved without it

----信心是得救的必须—没有人能不靠信心得救

Conclusion 结论

Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended, because it shows how we are enabled to do good works.  For without faith human nature can in no wise do the works of the First or of the Second Commandment. http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php - article20.37 Without faith it does not call upon God, nor expect anything from God, nor bear the cross, but seeks, and trusts in, man's help.  And thus, when there is no faith and trust in God all manner of lusts and human devices rule in the heart.  Wherefore Christ said, John 15:5: Without Me ye can do nothing;  and the Church sings: Lacking Thy divine favor, There is nothing found in man, Naught in him is harmless.

这样，人人都可以明明看出，这一个教理不但不应该被控为禁止善功，反倒应该大受赞许，因为它指示我们怎样才能行善。因为没有信，人的本性断不能遵行第一块与第二块法版上的事。没有信，人的本性就不呼吁上帝，仰望上帝，背十字架；他只会求人的帮助，依赖人的帮助。所以不信靠依赖上帝，人的心就为一切私欲和人的教训所左右。 因此基督教也说约翰福音15:5，“离了我，你们就不能作什么”教会所唱的诗也说，“没有你的能力，人里面一无所有，没有什么是无辜的。”

Notes:

注：

The charge of prohibiting good works really falls back on the heads of those who urge good works before and without faith and the Holy Spirit. For if a heart is not first through faith joined to Christ who is our Life, it can do nothing but indulge all manner of (evil) lusts.

对禁止好行为的指控应该落在那些不靠信心和圣灵而追求好行为的人的头上。因为若没有连接于基督我们生命之主的信心，人除了恶什么都不能做。
