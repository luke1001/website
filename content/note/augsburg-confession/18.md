Of Repentance they teach that for those who have fallen after Baptism there is remission of sins whenever they are converted; and that the Church ought to impart absolution to those thus returning to repentance. Now, repentance consist properly of these two parts: One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that, for Christ’s sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors. Then good works are bound to follow, which are the fruits of repentance. They condemn the Anabaptists, who deny that those once justified can lose the Holy Spirit. Also those who contend that some may attain to such perfection in this life that they cannot sin. The Novations also are condemned, who would not absolve such as had fallen after Baptism, though they returned to repentance. They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins comes through faith, but command us to merit grace through satisfactions of our own.

关于悔改他们教导受洗之后又跌倒的人无论他们什么时候回转他们的罪会被赦免；教会应该让给悔改的人知道赦免之恩。如今，悔改分为两部分：一个是悔罪，也就是因为认识罪而心中充满恐惧；另外一个是信心，也就是从福音而来的，或者说是从赦免之恩而来的，相信因为基督的缘故罪蒙赦免、良心得安慰免受恐惧折磨。然后要有好行为作为悔改的果子。他们谴责再洗礼派因为他们否认已经称义的人会失去圣灵。 他们也谴责那些主张一些人会在生命中达到完美的地步而不会犯罪。 他们还谴责诺洼天派 ，因为他们不会赦免受洗后再跌倒的人，即便他们悔改也是如此。主张赦罪不是来自信心而且要求我们通过自己的功德去赢得恩典的人也在排斥之列。

• Now our article will deal with an article of faith that is still embraced by much of the reform churches of today, the article of “Once saved always saved.” We will also look at the controversies of the past, which are still very much a part of the present.

我们今天的讲章要谈论一条关于信心看法，这章节至今还被很多改革宗教会所接纳，这就是“一次得救永远得救”。我们还会看一下过去的一些争论，事实很多至今还有争论。

First: a baptized Christian may fall away from faith according to the Scriptures

第一：根据圣经受洗的基督徒可能会在信心上跌倒。

Second: a person who did fall away from grace may return to repentance.

第二： 一个在恩典中跌倒的人可能会悔改。

Third: the church ought to pronounce forgiveness to every repentant sinner.

第三：教会应该向每一个悔改的罪人宣告赦免饶恕。

Martin Luther, in his Small Catechism wrote this about baptism: “Baptism works forgiveness of sin, delivers from death and the devil and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.”

马丁路德，在他的小问答中关于洗礼写道：“洗礼带来罪得赦免，救相信的人脱离死亡和魔鬼并且得到永远的救赎，这是神的话和应许”。

Baptism washes away our sins. Read the following…

![](/images/note/ags/18-1.jpg#right)

洗礼洗净我们的罪。请读以下经文…

Acts 2:38-39 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”

使徒行传 2:38-39 彼得说，你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵。因为这应许是给你们，和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们神所召来的。

Acts 22:16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.

使徒行传 22:16 现在你为什么耽延呢，起来，求告他的名受洗，洗去你的罪。

![](/images/note/ags/18-2.jpg#right)

Certainly Paul’s sins were washed away when Jesus died on the cross, well before he was baptized. However, the forgiveness that was won for Paul at the cross hadn’t been applied to his heart by faith until the moment of his baptism. For Baptism brings us into the family of God. Read the following…

当然在保罗受洗之前当耶稣死在十字架上的时候他的罪已经被洗净。但是在十字架上为保罗赢得的赦免之恩直到他受洗的时候才通过信心发生在保罗的身上。因为受洗使我们成为神家的一员。请读以下经文…

Galatians 3:26,27 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.

加拉太书 3:26,27 所以你们因信基督耶稣，都是神的儿子。你们受洗归入基督的，都是披戴基督了。

Now, the question at hand is, can a person, after receiving this “washing of his/her sins away” fall back into disgrace with God by becoming an unbeliever? Let’s hear what the Bible teaches us…

现在有一个问题，一个人在接受洗礼之后能不能成为一个不信的人成为主的羞耻？让我们看一下圣经的教导…

I Corinthians 10:12 “So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!”

哥林多前书 10:12 所以自己以为站得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒。

Application:

应用：

Romans 11:20 “Do not be arrogant, but be afraid,” [then adding] “For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either” (vs. 21).

罗马书 11:20 你不可自高反要惧怕。神既不爱惜原来的枝子，也必不爱惜你。

Application:

应用：

Note also, how Paul warns the Galatians:

同样，保罗也警告加拉太人：

Galatians 5:4 “You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.”

加拉太书 5:4 你们这要靠律法称义的，是与基督隔绝，从恩典中坠落了。

Application:

应用：

Paul urges Timothy:

保罗督促提摩太说：

I Timothy 1:19-20 “Holding on to faith and a good conscience,” [adding with a heavy heart,] “Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme”

提摩太前书 1:19-20 常存信心，和无亏的良心。有人丢弃良心，就在真道上如同船破坏了一般。其中有许米乃和亚力山大。我已经把他们交给撒但，使他们受责罚，就不再谤渎了。

Application:

应用：

Nehemiah 9:29-30 “You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples.”

尼希米记 9:29-30 又警戒他们，要使他们归服你的律法。他们却行事狂傲，不听从你的诫命，干犯你的典章（人若遵行就必因此活着），扭转肩头，硬着颈项，不肯听从。但你多年宽容他们，又用你的灵藉众先知劝戒他们，他们仍不听从，所以你将他们交在列国之民的手中。

Application:

应用：

Ezekiel 36:20 “And wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name, for it was said of them, “These are the Lord’s people, and yet they had to leave his land.’”

以西结书 36:20 他们到了所去的列国，就使我的圣名被亵渎。因为人谈论他们说，这是耶和华的民，是从耶和华的地出来的。

Application:

应用：

I Timothy 4:1 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.

提摩太前书 4:1 圣灵明说，在后来的时候，必有人离弃真道，听从那引诱人的（邪）灵，和鬼魔的道理。

Application:

应用：

II Timothy 1:15 You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.

提摩太后书 1:15 凡在亚西亚的人都离弃我，这是你知道的。其中有腓吉路和黑摩其尼。

Application:

应用：

II Timothy 2:17-18 Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.

提摩太后书 2:17-18 他们的话如同毒疮，越烂越大。其中有许米乃和腓理徒。他们偏离了真道，说复活的事已过，就败坏好些人的信心。

Application:

应用：

II Timothy 4:10 For Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica.

提摩太后书 4:10 因为底马贪爱现今的世界，就离弃我往帖撒罗尼迦去了。革勒士往加拉太去。提多往挞马太去。

Application:

应用：

Isaiah 66:3-4 But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man, and whoever offers a lamb, like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig’s blood, and whoever burns memorial incense, like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations; so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.
以赛亚书 66:3-4假冒为善的宰牛好像杀人。献羊羔好像打折狗项。献供物好像献猪血。烧乳香好像称颂偶像。这等人拣选自己的道路，心里喜悦行可憎恶的事。我也必拣选迷惑他们的事，使他们所惧怕的临到他们。因为我呼唤，无人答应。我说话，他们不听从。反倒行我眼中看为恶的，拣选我所不喜悦的。

Application:

应用：

Mark 4:18-20 Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop-thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown.

马可福音 4:18-20 还有那撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道。后来有世上的思虑，钱财的迷惑，和别样的私欲，进来把道挤住了，就不能结实。那撒在好地上的，就是人听道，又领受，并且结实，有三十倍的，有六十倍的，有一百倍的。

Application:

应用：

Hebrews 10:26-31 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.” It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.

希伯来书 10:26-31 因为我们得知真道以后，若故意犯罪，赎罪的祭就再没有了。惟有战惧等候审判和那烧灭众人的烈火。人干犯摩西的律法，凭两三个见证人，尚且不得怜恤而死。何况人践踏神的儿子，将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常，又亵慢施恩的圣灵，你们想，他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢。因为我们知道谁说，伸冤在我，我必报应。又说，主要审判他的百姓。落在永生神的手里真是可怕的。

Application:

应用：

James 5:19-20 My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone would bring him back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.

雅各书 5:19-20 我的弟兄们，你们中间若有失迷真道的，有人使他回转。这人该知道叫一个罪人从迷路上转回，便是救一个灵魂不死，并且遮盖许多的罪。

Application:

应用：

I Peter 5:8-9 Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

彼得前书 5:8-9 务要谨守，儆醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。你们要用坚固的信心抵挡他，因为知道你们在世上的众弟兄，也是经历这样的苦难。

Application:

应用：

II Peter 2:20-22 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.”

彼得后书 2:20-22 倘若他们因认识主救主耶稣基督，得以脱离世上的污秽，后来又在其中被缠住制伏，他们末后的景况，就比先前更不好了。他们晓得义路，竟背弃了传给他们的圣命，倒不如不晓得为妙。俗语说得真不错，狗所吐的他转过来又吃。猪洗净了又回到泥里去辊。这话在他们身上正合式。

Application:

应用：

II Peter 3:17-18 Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

彼得后书 3:17-18 亲爱的弟兄阿，你们既然豫先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们。

Application:

应用：

Revelation 2:5 Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.

启示录 2:5 所以应当回想你是从那里坠落的，并要悔改，行起初所行的事。你若不悔改，我就临到你那里，把你的灯台从原处挪去 。

Application:

应用：

I Corinthians 5:1,2,5 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of the kind that does not occur even among pagans: a man has his father’s wife. And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this? (5) hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.

哥林多前书 5: 1,2,5

1-2 风闻在你们中间有淫乱的事。这样的淫乱，连外邦人中也没有，就是有人收了他的继母。你们还是自高自大，并不哀痛，把行这事的人从你们中间赶出去。

5 要把这样的人交给撒但，败坏他的肉体，使他的灵魂在主耶稣的日子可以得救。

Application:

应用：

II Corinthians 2:6-8 The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him. Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.

哥林多后书 2:6-8 这样的人，受了众人的责罚，也就够了。倒不如赦免他，安慰他，免得他忧愁太过，甚至沉沦了。所以我劝你们，要向他显出坚定不移的爱心来。

Application:

应用：

With all these passages regarding a person’s ability to fall away from faith in Jesus, no wonder why the Bible admonishes and encourages Christians to make good use of their time of grace here on earth.

有这么多关于一个人可能跌倒而失去对主耶稣的信心的经节，难怪圣经要劝诫和鼓励基督徒珍惜在地上的恩典时代。

• Paul says it is necessary that a Christian work out his own salvation “with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12), and Peter warns, “Be self-controlled and alert,” because our “enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (I Peter 5:8). Jesus says, “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body (KJV = flesh) is weak” (Matthew 26:41).

保罗说基督徒应该“恐惧战兢”的做成自己得救的工作（腓立比书2:12），彼得警告道：“勿要谨守，儆醒”因为我们的“仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人”（彼得前书5:8）。 耶稣说：“总要儆醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了”（马太福音 26:41）。


• Yes, a baptized Christian may fall away from grace. But at the same time, those who have fallen away must not despair as though they were doomed and there was no help for them. Let them, instead, repent of their sins and turn to God in Christ Jesus for forgiveness. The way to repentance is not blocked for them, unless they block it for themselves through the error of unbelief!

是的，一个受洗的基督徒可能在恩典中跌倒。但是同时，跌倒的人不可绝望好像没有希望一样。相反，要让他们悔改认罪转向神以求赦免。通向悔改之路始终是向他们敞开的，除非他们因为不信的错误自己堵住了自己的路！

This leads us to the second point of our article today. The second truth which our Article confesses is that a person who did fall away from grace may return to repentance. This too, may not seem possible to us, especially when you consider what a baptized child of God throws away, namely, the blessing of forgiveness, new life, and salvation. Think about it…

这把我们引到今天的这一条要讨论的第二个问题。本条讲到的第二个真理就是在恩典中跌倒的人可以悔改。这看起来不太可能，尤其是当你想到一个受洗的神的儿女抛弃赦免之恩、新生命和救恩。思考一下…

A baptized child of Christ…

1）Tasted God’s mercy in Christ

2）Received forgiveness in baptism

3）More than likely received Jesus’ pardon in the Lord’s Supper

4）Enjoyed the peace of knowing that even when his/her world was crashing in on him, his Lord would never leave nor forsake him

一个受洗的主的儿女…

1）尝过神藉基督所赐的怜悯

2）在洗礼中得赦免

3）在圣餐中得到耶稣的饶恕

4）因为知道即便世界倒塌主也不会离弃他所以心中充满平安。

But…then the baptized child of Jesus runs away from God! He once had the Holy Spirit living in his heart by faith, but then, by rejecting him, he drives him away.

但是…受洗的耶稣的儿女却远离了神！他曾经因着信受了圣灵，但是后来却拒绝并赶走了神。

Can such a person, who deliberately committed spiritual suicide, return now to good grace with God and live a life of repentance?

这样的一个人，也就是故意犯灵里谋杀的人，能重新回到神的恩典里过悔改的生活吗？

Before answering that question, consider the life of King David and the life of the apostle Peter?

在回答这个问题之前，思考一下大卫王和使徒彼得的一生？  

The apostle John sent the churches of Asia minor warning in Revelation. To Ephesus he wrote: “Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first” (Rev. 2:5). To Pergamum: “I have a few things against you...Repent” (2:14,16). To Laodicea: “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent” (3:19).

使徒约翰在启示录中给小亚细亚的教会警告。给以弗所教会他写道：“所以应当回想你是从那里坠落的，并要悔改，行起初所行的事”（启2:5）。给别迦摩教会：“然而有几件事我要责备你…所以你当悔改”（2:14,16）。给老底嘉教会：“凡我所疼爱的，我就责备管教他。所以你要发热心，也要悔改”（3:19）。

Incredible, though it may seem, what is God ready to do to the impenitent sinner while he is living here earth?

神所乐意为在世的未悔改的罪人所做的看起来有点不可思议？

Hear the promise of God through Isaiah:

让我们来听神通过以赛亚所说的预言：

Isaiah 55:7-8 Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the LORD.”

以赛亚书 55:7-8 恶人当离弃自己的道路。不义的人当除去自己的意念，归向耶和华，耶和华就必怜恤他，当归向我们的神，因为神必广行赦免。 耶和华说，我的意念，非同你们的意念，我的道路，非同你们的道路。

If the Lord is ready to forgive the impenitent sinner, what’s that to say in regards to a Christian congregation and individual members?

如果神乐意饶恕一个未悔改的罪人，这对我们教会和个人有什么启示？

• Therefore as our article states, the church ought to impart absolution to those returning in repentance.

所以正如本条所说的教会应该赦免悔改归回的人。

The church has been given the ministry of the keys, which not only lock doors to heaven, but also open the doors to heaven through the gospel. The prophet Isaiah addresses the church, when he says, “You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God!” (Isaiah 40:9).

教会有钥匙事工的使命，这钥匙不光可以锁住通往天堂之门，还可以通过福音打开通往天堂之门。先知以赛亚提到教会这样说：“报好信息给锡安的阿，你要登高山。报好信息给耶路撒冷的阿，你要极力扬声。扬声不要惧怕，对犹大的城邑说，看哪，你们的神。（以赛亚书40:9）。

The chief purpose of the church is to strengthen and edify one another through the miraculous means of grace - the gospel in Word and sacrament! When Jesus reinstated Simon Peter, what did he say in the last chapter of John?

教会的主要作用就是通过奇异的恩典方式—福音也就是神的话和圣礼—来彼此鼓励和彼此教导。

![](/images/note/ags/18-3.jpg#center)

Paul encouraged the Colossians to “let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God” (3:16).

保罗鼓励歌罗西教会：“当用各样的智慧，把基督的道里，丰丰富富的存在心里，（或作当把基督的道里丰丰富富的存在心里以各样的智慧）用诗章，颂词，灵歌，彼此教导，互相劝戒，心被恩感歌颂神”（歌罗西书3:16）。

This is to be done with tender regard for the special needs of the various members. Some may need feeding; some may need correction or admonition, and still others might need rebuke. Paul reminds the elders of Ephesus that “The Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood” (Acts 20:28).

要这样做就要我们去悉心的去顾及到每一位成员的需要。有些需要喂养；有些需要纠正和劝诫；而有些需要指责。保罗提醒以弗所的长老们“圣灵立你们作全群的监督，你们就当为自己谨慎，也为全群谨慎，牧养神的教会，就是他用自己血所买来的。（或作救赎）”（使徒行传20:28）

Some may need teaching and training. Timothy is not only to serve as a teacher himself, but he is to commit the gospel which he received “to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others” (II Timothy 2:2).

有些可能需要教导和培训。提摩太不仅要做好教导的职分还要把他接受的福音“交托那忠心能教导别人的人”（提摩太后书2:2）。

Consider why our article of faith condemns the teaching, “Once saved always saved?”

思考我们这篇关于信心的讲章为什么指责这种“一次得救永远得救”的教导？

The church must never forget that every Christian faces the ever-present danger of being caught in the snares of sin. “We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves” (Romans 15:1). “Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted” (Galatians 6:1).

教会不能忽视现今每一位基督徒都面临无处不在的罪的网罗。我们坚固的人，应当担代不坚固人的软弱，不求自己的喜悦（罗马书15:1）。弟兄们，若有人偶然被过犯所胜，你们属灵的人，就应当用温柔的心，把他挽回过来。又当自己小心，恐怕也被引诱。（加拉太书6:1）

But what if a brother or sister in the faith does not heed the warning of a Christian brother or sister? What steps does Jesus instruct?

但是如果弟兄或姊妹不听其他弟兄姊妹的建议该怎么办？耶稣教导我们怎么做？

But after we hurl a former brother or sister in Christ over to the grips of Satan himself, through excommunication, let us not forget the ultimate purpose for such actions—that we may win the erring brother or sister over to Christ again. Let us remember the parable of the prodigal son, how the father had to let him go into the deep abyss of his sins before the boy was ready to come back.

当我们把我们曾经的主内的弟兄或姊妹逐出教会使他落入撒旦手中之后，让我们不要忘记我们这样做的最终目的是—我们能把误入歧途的弟兄或姊妹重新挽救到主里。让我们牢记浪子的故事，父亲在浪子回头之前要先放他出去闯荡。

What do we as Christians need to fight against with a lost sheep’s return to the fold?

我们基督徒应该反对什么才能使一只迷失的羊归回羊群？

Remember how Peter hesitated about the matter of forgiveness and thought he would be doing all that could be expected if he forgave his brother perhaps once or twice? He asked the Lord, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?” (Matthew 18:21). Do you remember Jesus’ answer?

还记得彼得如何不明白饶恕还以为只要饶恕自己的弟兄一两次？他问主：“主阿，我弟兄得罪我，我当饶恕他几次呢。七次可以么？”（马太福音18:21）你记得耶稣的回答吗？

What was the reaction of the older brother of the prodigal when the wayward son returned?

当刚愎自用的浪子回到家中的时候他的哥哥有什么反应？

Why did Paul have to remind the church at Corinth to forgive and comfort the adulterer who repented? (2 Corinthians 2:6-8)

为什么保罗要提醒格林多教会要饶恕和安慰悔改的犯淫乱的人？（哥林多后书2:6-8）

•  Our article of faith also condemns the teaching of the Anabaptists. Strict Calvinists today hold the same view. They say that once man has been reborn he can never again lose his faith. A Presbyterian statement of faith on February 21, 1929, had this to say on the final perseverance of the saints:

我们关于信心的这篇讲章也反对再洗礼派。保守的加尔文教徒也持相同观点。他们认为人若重生之后就不会失去信心。1929年二月21日的一个长老会的信心声明关于圣徒最后的坚忍是这样说的：

“This doctrine teaches that those who are true believers in Christ as their Savior, since they are foreordained to salvation, never can fall completely away from salvation, but will persevere in the faith until the end of their lives and be saved. In other words, once a man becomes a true Christian, he will remain a Christian till he dies, and is saved for all eternity.”

这条教义告诉我们真正信基督是他们救主的信徒，因为他们已经预定要得救恩，就不会从救恩上完全跌倒，而会在信心上站立直到生命结束被提。换句话说，一旦一个人成为真正的基督徒就会到死都是基督徒，并且永远得救。

• This we condemn, because the Bible clearly teaches otherwise! This article of faith promotes complacency and indifference and Jesus and his apostles and the prophets of the Old Testament clearly speak against this doctrine.

我们反对这种观点因为圣经的教导很明显的与之不同！这篇关于信心的篇章充满自满和冷漠，耶稣和他的门徒还有旧约的先知所说的明确的反驳这个教义。

That Presbyterian article then goes on to distinguish mere “church members” from true Christians and says: “Of course, no one denies that church members fall into sin and sometimes reject Christ completely until the end of their lives. That is a fact of experience all too common, and must be admitted by all. This is explained by Calvinists as being due to the fact that such persons never truly believed in Christ as their Savior, and were therefore never truly Christians.”

那篇长老会的文章接下来区分一般“教会会友”跟真正的基督徒：“当然没有人否认有些会友落入罪中一直到生命的结束都抵挡基督。这种现象司空见惯，人人应当正视。卡尔文教徒解释说这是因为这样的人从来没有真正的相信基督是救主因此从来都不是真正的基督徒。”

The article goes on to make another distinction:

本条接下来做了另外一个比较：

“Nor is it denied that Christians who are really among the elect may sometimes sin terribly and grieve the Spirit, even to the extent of withdrawing from the church for a time. We believe, however, that in all such cases, if the person in question is among the elect and has truly believed in Christ as his Savior, he will eventually return to the fold and be saved, though his lapse into sin may have injured himself and perhaps brought others to destruction...If a person is once truly saved he cannot fall completely away from grace.”

“不可否认一些被拣选的基督徒会犯严重的罪使圣灵忧伤，甚至他们会退出教会一段时间。然而我们相信，在所有这些情形当中，如果这个人是被拣选的并且真正相信基督是救主，他最终会回到羊群并且得救，尽管在这个过程中他的过错会会伤害自己也可能摧毁别人…一个人一旦得救就不能从恩典中跌落。”

Quite simply, in the error of those who hold to this doctrine, you have a group of people that wish to deal with the invisible church, which is only seen by God. This again, is very foreign to the Scriptures. Paul warns such a person, “You stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid” (Romans 11:20). And again: “So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!” (I Corinthians 10:12).

显而易见，错误的持守这样教导的人是一些只想跟看不见教会打交道的人，这样的教会只有神才看得见。这也跟圣经大相径庭。保罗警告这样的人：“你因为信，所以立得住。你不可自高，反要惧怕”（罗马书11:20）。另外他又说：“所以自己以为站得稳的，须要谨慎，免得跌倒！”（哥林多前书 10:12）。

•  Perfectionism is also an old and yet modern error that has crept its way into the church. Perfectionism began long before Wesley brought it to the church. The Roman Catholic church, for centuries, has maintained that some Christians not only can achieve perfectly pure sanctification in this life but are also able by keeping the monastic vows to do more good works than are required of them for their own salvation. In which case, they can hand a few of them off to their dead relatives if they have a little extra. We also condemn this error!

完美主义也是进入教会中的一个古老而常新的错误。早在卫斯理把它带入教会之前完美主义就已存在。几个世纪以来罗马天主教会主张有些基督徒不仅可以在生活中完全成圣而且可以通过持守修道院誓言来行过多的善来得救。而且如果有多余的他们还可以借一些善行给他们已死的亲属。我们也反对这种错误！

In Romans 7, Paul reminds us that sin will always threaten and irritate us so that we never really do what we want to do as Christians. Paul called himself a “wretched man” because of his daily struggle against sin and the frequent defeats he suffered (Romans 7:24).

在罗马书七章，保罗提醒我们罪会一直威胁和困扰我们使我们不能做基督徒想做的事情。保罗称自己“真是苦”因为他每天都在跟罪争战还常常失败。

St. John warns us, “If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives” (I John 1:8,10).

圣约翰警告我们：“我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了”（约翰一书1:8,10）。

• The Novations. About the middle of the third century there was a persecution of the church in northern Africa. Many Christians denied their faith in one way or another. After the persecution the presbyter Novatus favored a very rigorous procedure against the “fallen” ones. Together with a certain Novatian, he fathered a following and separated from the church. By a rigid disciplinary procedure the Novatians tried to maintain the purity of the church, otherwise known as perfectionism.

诺洼天派。大约在三世纪中叶，在北非有一场对教会的迫害。很多基督徒以不同的方式否认了自己的信仰。在迫害过后，长老诺伐脱对“跌倒”的人采取非常严厉的手段。他跟诺西安一起带领一部分人离开教会。诺洼天派建立严格的制度为要保持教会的纯洁，有时他们也被称为完美主义者。

When Luther and his colleagues had condemned this sect of the past, they were ultimately condemning the teaching and practice of the Roman church, who had adopted and embraced the teaching of the Novatians. Remember, the Catholics have a third part to repentance, called satisfaction, where they teach that a sinner can make amends for his own sin through acts of penance.

当路德和他的同工批判这个派别的时候，事实上他们是为了批判罗马教会的教导和行为，因为他们采纳和接受诺洼天派的教导。要知道，天主教认罪还有第三部分叫做弥补罪过，关于这一点他们教导罪人可以用自己的苦行来弥补罪过。

From beginning to end, repentance in the Roman church is the product of man’s own efforts, which we saw last week. In the Roman Catholic church the sinner works up in his own heart a feeling of remorse. The sinner decides to confess his sins before the priest and does so according to the best of his ability. The sinner pays the penalties imposed by the church. But the worst part of it is that every one of these three parts is considered as meritorious.

在罗马教会悔改从始至终都是人的工作，正如我们上周所看到的。在罗马天主教罪人通过自己的努力来产生懊悔感。罪人自己尽力靠自己的努力做出决定向神父忏悔。罪人要承受教会所给的惩罚。最坏的是这三部分每一部分都被认为是值得称赞的。
