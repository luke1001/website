Of the use of the Sacraments they teach that the Sacraments were ordained, not only to be marks of profession among men, but rather to be signs and testimonies of the will of God toward us, instituted to awaken and confirm faith in those who use them. Wherefore we must so use the Sacraments that faith be added to believe the promises which are offered and set forth through the Sacraments. They therefore condemn those who teach that the Sacraments justify by the outward act, and who do not teach that, in the use of the Sacraments, faith which believes that sins are forgiven, is required.

关于圣礼他们教导圣礼是神所设立的，不单是要作为在人当中我们的信仰表白更重要的是作为神对我们的旨意的彰显和见证，使参加的人信心得到坚固和更新。因此我们要存信心领受，相信圣礼所赐给我们的并且相信神通过圣餐所给我们的应许。因此他们反对认为圣礼本身使人称义和没有教导圣礼需要相信罪得赦免的人。

#### WHAT IS THE USE, THE PURPOSE, OR THE BENEFIT OF SACRAMENTS? 圣礼有什么作用、目的和益处？

![](/images/note/ags/19-1.jpg#center)


Let’s begin our lesson today with a test in order to refresh our memories:

让我们以一个测验来唤起我们记忆作为我们今天课程的开始：

1）What are the sacraments (sacred orders) that Jesus gave to his church?

1）耶稣赐给教会的圣礼（按顺序）有哪些？

-------------------- & ------------------------

2）What Swiss reformer in the Middle Centuries made the claim that the sacraments were nothing more than marks of faith or exclusively outward symbols, but not means of grace?

2）哪位中世纪的瑞士的改革家宣称圣礼并不是恩典得的途径只不过是信心的标志或特殊的外在的标志？

----------------- Von ---------------------.

3）What church body today states that the sacraments are vehicles by which the Holy Spirit is transported to the hearts of people to create faith, or strengthen and nourish faith?

3）今天哪个教会认为圣礼是圣灵借以在人心中产生信心或坚固和稳定信心的工具？

------------------------

4）What 3 reasons do Lutherans consider the Lord’s Supper and Baptism to be sacraments?

4）路德宗认为圣餐和洗礼是圣礼的组成部分有哪三方面原因？

1. 

2. 

3.  

5）Do you believe that any person who does not desire to be baptized is clearly indicating that he does not want to be classified with Christians?

5）你相信如果一个人不想受洗就是在明确表示不想成为基督徒吗？

6）Do you believe that the majority of people who come to the Lord’s Table to receive his body and blood for the forgiveness of their sins desire to be numbered with the Christians?

6）你相信大部分为着罪到神的桌前领他的身体和宝血的人想成为基督徒吗？


• Remember, it was Ulrich Von Zwingly who denied the necessity of the sacraments and emptied them of their value by saying that they are only marks or professions of faith, but inwardly, he claimed, there is no working of the Holy Spirit. Our forefathers in the Augsburg Confession drew away from Zwingly’s position.

记住，是慈运理否认圣礼的必要性认为圣礼没有价值只不过是信心的标志或表白，但是他心中其实认为其中没有圣灵的工作。我们的前辈在奥兹堡信经中没有跟这种说法站在一起。

• While we maintain that the sacraments are marks by which we are identified in Christ, we also recognize the sacraments as vehicles by which the Holy Spirit chooses to create, sustain, and nurture an individual’s faith. This will be the focus of our study today.

我们承认圣礼是使我们分别出来成为基督徒的标志，同时圣礼也是圣灵建造、维持、供养个人信心的工具。这也是我们今天学习的重点。

First, let us look at the “marks of faith.”

首先，让我们一起来看一下“信心的标志”。

![](/images/note/ags/19-2.jpg#right)

I Corinthians 11:26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

哥林多前书 11:26 你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。

1. What does Paul say that we are doing each time we come to the Lord’s Table?

    保罗说我们每逢来到主的桌前时我们在做什么？

    • Therefore, by publicly partaking of the Lord’s Supper we are drawing a line between us and rest of the world. Christians proclaim the death of their Savior for the forgiveness of their sins, while the rest of the world relies on something else for their deliverance in life. Receiving the Lord’s Supper is a confession of faith on the part of the Christian that they are with Jesus and his church, connected in part through this sacred meal that he gives to us.

    因此，通过公开的参加圣餐我们就与世上其他人划清了界线。 基督徒表明救主的死使罪得赦免，然而世上其他人依靠其它的事物做他们的救主。领圣餐就是一个一个基督徒信心的表白，表明他们是属于耶稣和他的教会的，通过他所赐的圣餐与之联接。

    Yes, taking communion is definitely a mark that you belong to the family of believers! But more than that, the apostle teaches us in his letter to the Corinthians that there is a close connection that we share with the people whom we choose to commune with. Read the following…

    是的，领圣餐绝对是一个你属于信徒家庭成员的一个标志！但是不仅如此，使徒在给格林多人的信中教导圣餐使一同领受的人连接更加紧密。读以下经文…

    ![](/images/note/ags/19-3.jpg#right)    

    I Corinthians 10:17 Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.

    哥林多前书 10:17我们虽多，仍是一个饼，一个身体。因为我们都是分受这一个饼。

2. What relationship exists between me the communicant and the person that I commune with to the right and left of me?

    我和领圣餐的人还有领圣餐时在我左边和右边的人又什么关系？

    •  When you approach the Lord’s Table, you do so with the firm belief that everything he has promised you in this meal, namely—bread, wine, body, and blood, and forgiveness of sins, will be given to you. And by your example you are encouraging others to take the Lord’s words at face value as well.

    当你来到神的桌前的时候，你坚定的相信在圣餐中神所应许你的包括—饼、杯、身体、宝血和赦罪之恩都会赐给你。你这样做也是为了鼓励其他人能够来认识到神话语的宝贵。

    **Part II. A SECONDARY PURPOSE OF THE SACRAMENTS 圣礼的第二层目的**

    Outside of the mark of faith, these sacraments serve us Christians as our article states, “To awaken and confirm faith in those who use them.”

    除了作为信心的标志外，圣礼之于基督徒还如本篇所述：“在参加的人信中激起并稳固他们的信心”。

    We know that it is God’s will that none shall be lost, but rather, that all would come to a saving knowledge of his forgiveness in Christ. We need the forgiveness of our sins, and God wants us to have it. He not only announces this fact to us in his Word, but he also places the forgiveness of our sins into Baptism, so that by this “washing with water through the word” (Ephesians 5:26) we may have a visible indication of his good will toward us.

    我们知道神的心意是叫万人认识基督的救恩不愿一人沉沦。我们需要神的赦免之恩，而神也愿意赐给我们。他不仅用他的话告诉我们这个事实并且通过洗礼把救恩赐给我们，透过“水藉着道洗净”（以弗所书5:26）我们可以清楚的看见他的美意。

    Our God also places the forgiveness of our sins into the Supper, so that in and with the bread and wine we will eat and drink the very body and blood of Christ, which were given and shed for the remission of our sins. Again, we have an indication of God’s good will toward us.

    神也藉圣餐赐下他的赦罪之恩，藉着吃饼喝杯我们就在吃喝主的身体和宝血，也就是为我们的罪舍上的。
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/19-4.jpg#right) 

    Our article calls the sacraments signs because as such they indicate and announce to us the grace of God. Read the following…

    本篇称圣礼为记号是因为它表示和宣示神的恩典。请读一下经文…

    Romans 4:1-3 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. 3 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

    罗马书 4:1-3 如此说来，我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕，凭着肉体得了什么呢。倘若亚伯拉罕是因行为称义，就有可夸的。只是在神面前并无可夸的。经上说什么呢。说，亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义。

3. What made Abraham righteous? Faith or circumcision?

    是什么使亚伯拉罕称义？信心还是割礼？

4. What was the point, then, of the covenant of circumcision?

    那么割礼之约还有什么意义？

    Romans 4:11 And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.

    罗马书 4:11 并且他受了割礼的记号，作他未受割礼的时候因信称义的印证，叫他作一切未受割礼而信之人的父，使他们也算为义。


    Fill in the blank:

    God had made a special ---------------- with Abraham, that in him and in his seed all the
families of the earth should be --------------. Twenty ----------- long years had passed since God announced his promise to Abraham. Abraham was now --- --- years old; Sarah, his wife, was --- --- years old and she was still barren. It was difficult for Abraham to have ----------- in the promise that he should have a ----- from whom should stem the ------------ of the world.

    神给亚伯拉罕一个特别--------，就是从他和他的后代中地上的万族都要--------。 之后二十-----------年过去了。亚伯拉罕现在--------岁；撒拉，他的妻子，------岁还没有生育。亚伯拉罕很难对应许还有--------，相信他会有一个------, 然后从他会生出世界------------。

    Twice he had schemed to assist the --------- in carrying out his plan. At first he thought of ------------- a son, mentioning his steward ----------------. He said to God, “You have given me no -----------------; so a -------------- in my household will be my ----------” (Genesis 15:3). The LORD, however, emphatically said, “This -------- will not be your --------” (vs. 4). Instead, he promised him a --------- of his own. A second time Abraham tried to assist God by taking the suggestion of Sarah and marrying her maidservant by the name of ------------, an Egyptian.

    曾经两次他想帮助--------来施行他的计划。第一次他想------一个儿子，也就是他的管家-----------.他对神说“你没有给我-------------；所以一个在我家中的----------将会成为（创世纪15:3）”。然而神明确的说“这个---------不是你的---------”(vs.4)。相反，他应许给他一个他自己的---------.第二次亚伯拉罕要帮助神他采取撒拉的建议去一个使女名叫-----------,是一个埃及人。

    Abe had a son with her and they named him ----------------. Even when Abraham was ---- ---- years old, he still thought of ---------------- as the heir of the promise. He said to God, “If only -------------- might live under your blessing” (Genesis 17:18), because Abe’s -------- had a hard time accepting God’s promises still. Who would have thought that a man in his 100th year and his wife in her ------------ th year could have a son. Even Sarah found this to be a bit ------------ so she -------------. But the Lord repeated his promise: “Your wife Sarah will bear you a --------” (Genesis 17:19). And so God encouraged Abraham’s -------------- faith by saying, “I am God --------------; walk before me and be blameless” (Genesis 17:1). It was at this time that God instituted the sacrament of ----------------. It was to be a seal of his promise and a help to Abraham’s faith.

    亚伯拉罕跟她生下一子名叫------------. 一直到亚伯拉罕---------岁时，他还一直认为--------------是所应许的继承人。他对上帝说“但愿-----------活在你面前”（创世纪17:18），因为亚伯拉罕的--------------很难相信神的应许。谁能想到一个一百岁的男性和------岁的妻子能再生一个儿子。连撒拉都觉得这有点----------所以她-----------.但是神重申他的应许：“你妻子撒拉要给你生一个----------”（创世纪17:19）。所以神鼓励亚伯拉罕的------------信心说：“我是---------的神；你当在我面前做完全人”（创世纪17:1）。也就是在这个时候神开设了---------- 圣礼。那是他应许的印记和对亚伯拉罕信心的一个帮助。

    So the next time you come to the Lord’s Table, skeptical that he can provide you with everything he promises to provide you with in that meal, namely bread, wine, body, and blood, for the forgiveness of our sins, remember the story of Abraham and learn well the lesson: WHAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MAN IS POSSIBLE WITH GOD!

    所以下次领圣餐的时候，如果你怀疑他会不会把他所应许的一切藉圣餐赐下，包括饼、杯、身体和宝血，为着要赦免你的罪，请牢记亚伯拉罕的故事和从中学到的功课：人看不可能的事在神凡事都能！

    Why not look at the Sacraments, which Christ instituted the same way? They are God’s special means of grace by which he assists us in our faith. Similarly, they are testimonies to us that God has yet again done the impossible. He has made atonement for our sins, personally; he has blotted them out in the sacrifice of his Son; he has covered us with the garments of his Son’s righteousness; he has adopted us as his children and has appointed us as heirs of everlasting life.

    为什么不以同样的眼光看神所设立的圣餐礼呢？这是神用来帮助坚固我们信心的特殊的恩典途径。相同的，这也是见证让我们看到神又做成了不可能的事。他为我们的罪做了赎罪祭，藉他儿子的死罪得以遮盖；又用他儿子的义袍为我们穿上；他接受我们做他的儿女并让我们可以承受永生。

    Baptism, being the sacrament of initiation, is chiefly intended to awaken the faith of a tiny child. And baptism never loses its power no matter how long ago it was performed, but we may revert to it daily in our trials and our lapses and find it a potent power to revive our fainting faith.

    洗礼，作为圣礼的入门，旨在唤醒我们小子心中的信心。不管多久之前进行的洗礼它都不会失去效力，并且在我们每天的试炼和过错当中它还会不时的发挥作用，它会成为我们软弱的信心增长的帮助。

5. The Lord’s Supper, being the sacrament of confirmation, is chiefly intended to strengthen our faith. In the very words of institution what one word does Jesus use so that our faith is revived and invigorated?

    圣餐，作为圣礼的确定，旨在坚固我们的信心。在圣餐礼设立的用词中，耶稣用哪个词使我们的信心复苏和挑旺起来？

    Because our God is very much concerned about our faith, he allows us various opportunities to have that faith strengthened (The gospel in Word and sacrament). God knows that the enemies of our faith, (The world, our sinful flesh, and Satan) will constantly try to rob us of our joy in God’s grace.

    因为我们的神很看重我们的信心，所以他给我们不同的机会来坚固我们的信心（神的话也就是福音和圣礼）。神了解我们的信心的仇敌（世界，罪的肉体和撒旦）会抢夺我们在神的恩典中的喜乐。

6. Last week, we looked at the lesson, which showed that we too should also be concerned about our faith because it is possible for a Christian to lose his/her faith in God if it is not strengthened by God in his Word. How concerned is the individual soul who never comes to God’s Word and never comes to the Lord’s Table for refreshing?

    上周我们学习的课程让我们认识到我们也要留心我们的信心，因为如果没有神的话语的坚固基督徒可能会丢失自己的信心。从来没有听过神的话语和从来没有领圣餐的人的灵魂是多么让人担心？

By use of the means of Grace, we not only show God our own concern for our faith, but we also allow God to work on our faith by reminding us of his goodness in the gospel.

通过使用恩典的途径，我们不仅让神看到我们留意我们的信心，而且我们也让神通过提醒我们他福音的美善而在我们的信心上做工。

Let us apply the sacraments in the form of a mini test?

让我们用一个小测验的方式来应用圣礼。

Baptism

洗礼

Why do you have your children baptized? Is it because you believe in your own baptism? Do you use your own baptism as a daily source for the renewal of your faith and spiritual life by calling back to mind what God has promised you in baptism? Do you daily drown your Old Adam in your baptism and draw forth the new man crated like God in true righteousness and holiness? Do you cherish your baptism as an ever-flowing fountain of comfort and strength when your faith feels faint and weak? And do you wish your child to have access to this same sign and testimony of God’s will toward him? Or do you have your child baptized merely because that is customary among Christians?

你为什么会让你的孩子受洗？是因为你相信自己的洗礼吗？你有没有通过洗礼来记起神在其中的应许来使你每天的信心的到更新？你每天有没有在洗礼中把你的老亚当埋葬并扶起像神一样圣洁公义的新人。你有没有珍视洗礼让它作为你软弱时的源源不断的安慰和帮助？你希望你的孩子能像你一样能看到神的旨意的标记和见证吗？还是你的孩子受洗仅仅是因为这是基督徒的传统？

God instituted Baptism as a sign and testimony of his will toward us in order to awaken faith in us. Hence we must use Baptism in such a way that faith is added to believe the promise which is offered and set forth through Baptism.

神设立洗礼作为他的旨意的标记和见证，目的是唤醒我们的信心。因此我们必须正确对待洗礼，洗礼中有神的应许为要使我们的信心的坚固。

The Lord’s Supper

圣餐

Why do you take communion? Do you take it to fill your punch card with God? (Since God commanded it, I’d better get up there). Do you consider your going to Communion as a good work which in itself merits God’s favor? Do you worry about your worthiness before coming? Some people postpone their taking of Communion, with the hopes that they will feel more worthy to take it next time. No, God didn’t give us this sacred meal to test our obedience to him, nor did he give it to us to earn bonus points with him, but rather, to confirm and strengthen our faith in him.

你为什么领圣餐？你领圣餐仅仅是为了走形式吗？（这是神的命令，我最好这么做）。你觉得领圣餐是可以赢得神的喜悦的善行吗？在参加之前有没有担心自己不配得？有些人因此推迟领圣餐，因为他们希望自己下次会更配得。不是的，神赐给我们圣餐不是为了试验我们是否忠诚，也不是我们为自己积累善行的方式，而是为了坚固和刚强我们对他的信心。

The Sacrament is a sign and testimony of God’s gracious will toward us, instituted in order to confirm our faith, which God knows we sorely need because of our unworthiness. Therefore, are self-examination before coming to the Lord’s Table, need not be a self-torture of all our wretched deeds. The purpose of our self-examination is merely to heighten our joy in embracing the gospel of forgiveness through Christ’s work of redemption.

圣礼是神的恩典的旨意的见证和标记，设立是为了坚固我们的信心。神知道这是我们非常需要的，因为我们本来什么都不能做。因此在领圣餐前，需要的省察自己的罪而不是为自己的罪苦修。我们省察自己的罪主要是我们能更加喜乐因为我们能够接受基督救赎的福音。

Luther once said, “He is prepared, who believes these words, ‘Given and shed for you for the remission of sins.’ The words, ’For you’ require nothing but hearts that believe.” (Small Catechism).

路德曾说：“相信这话他为你的罪流血摆上的人，他已经预备好了。为你一词只要求你有相信的心。

Let us then use the sacrament of communion as a faith strengthener. For we realize the sinfulness of our nature; we realize our own weakness in resisting temptation; we realize our lack of zeal to do good works; we realize our lack of patience under the cross. Our faith is far from what it should be. God knows it, and for that very purpose he gave us the Sacrament that by its use our faith might be confirmed.

让我们把圣餐作为坚固我们信心的方式。因为我们认识到自己的罪性；我们认识到自己在抵挡诱惑方面的软弱；我们认识到我们缺乏行善的热心；我们认识到我们缺乏背十字架的忍耐。我们的信心离另想状态还差很远。神知道，也这因为此神赐下圣餐以使我们的信心得到坚固。
