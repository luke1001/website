Also they teach that since the fall of Adam, all men begotten in the natural way are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trust in God, and with concupiscence; and that this disease, or vice of origin, is truly sin, even now condemning and bringing eternal death upon those not born again through Baptism and the Holy Ghost. 

They condemn the Pelagians and others who deny that original depravity is sin, and who, to obscure the glory of Christ’s merit and benefits, argue that man can be justified before God by his own strength and reason.

他们还教导，自从亚当犯罪之后，世上所有以自然方式出生的人都生来就有罪，也就是说，他们不敬畏神、不信任神、带有强烈的私欲；这种疾病，即生来就有的瑕疵是真实的罪，这罪甚至现在就在审判、且把永远的灭亡带给那些没有借洗礼和圣灵而重生的人。

他们定伯拉纠教派以及一切否认人具有与生俱来的堕落本性的派别为有罪；定那些忽略基督品格和救赎荣耀、认为人可以靠自己的力量和智慧在神面前称义的人为有罪。

- In this article, the forefathers of the Lutheran church have made the clear proclamation that our will, from the moment of conception is held in slavery to the devil. In other words, we are spiritual slaves who cannot break the chains of sin on our own power.

- 在这一条中，路德宗教会的先辈们清楚地宣告：从母亲怀胎的那一刻，我们的意愿就被那恶者所俘虏。换句话说，我们都是属灵的奴隶，靠自己的力量不能摆脱罪的锁链。

People have tried to come up with all sorts of ideas as to how they can get back into a right relationship with God. Consider what King Solomon wrote in the wisdom literature of the Proverbs…

人类已经努力想出了各种各样的办法来恢复与神的正常关系。思考所罗门王在智慧之书—箴言中所写的话：

Proverbs 16:25 - There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

《箴言》16条25节“有一条路、人以为正、至终成为死亡之路。”

Give three examples of ways that “Seems Right” to a person. Use the pictures for help.

举三个例子说明一个人所走的是“人以为正”的路。可以使用图画加以说明。

1)

2)

3)

1. Why is the righteousness of man (apart from the righteousness that we receive by faith through Jesus Christ) complete hypocrisy and a stench in our Lord’s nostrils?

    为什么说人的义（不包括我们借信心从耶稣基督那里接受的义）完全是虚假，在我们神的鼻孔中都是臭气？

    Philippians 3:7-9 7But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 8What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.

    腓力比书3:7-9-----7只是我先前以为与我有益的，我现在因基督都当作有损的。8不但如此，我也将万事当作有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事，看作粪土，为要得着基督。9并且得以在他里面，不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信神而来的义。

2. What did Paul (writer of the letter to the Philippians) once consider as a profit in his former way of life?

    保罗（写信给腓力比教会的作者）说在他以前的生活中，他以为有益的事情是什么？

3. Why did Paul now consider his former way of life (pursuing righteousness by means of the law) a complete loss for the sake of knowing Jesus Christ?

    保罗为什么现在认为他以前的生活方式（靠律法寻求称义）因为认识了基督耶稣而完全变成了损失？

4. Why was it impossible for Paul to find a righteousness from himself?

    为什么保罗不可能从自己身上找到义？
5. How did Paul receive the holiness that God requires from him?

    保罗怎样接受了神要求他必须有的圣洁？

    **Who said it? 这是谁说的？**

    “If anyone says that he who is justified...does not by good works himself...merit an increase of grace...let him be damned.”

    “如果有人说他被称义了-----但并不是靠自己的好行为----配得神加倍的恩典----让他受到诅咒。”


    “If anyone says that all the sins which are committed after baptism are either forgiven or made forgivable only by remembering and believing in the baptism that has been received, let him be damned.”

    “如果有人说，人受洗之后所犯的所有罪只因为记得并相信他在洗礼中已经接受了饶恕而被饶恕，或是已经变成可饶恕的，让他受到诅咒。”

    Isaiah 64:6 All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.

    赛64：6 我 们 都 像 不 洁 净 的 人 ， 所 有 的 义 都 像 污 秽 的 衣 服 。 我 们 都 像 叶 子 渐 渐 枯 干 。 我 们 的 罪 孽 好 像 风 把 我 们 吹 去4-5

    Respond: a friend of yours says, “I’ve always tried to live a decent life and be fair to everyone and love everyone and if God can’t accept me for my efforts then I guess he will have to punish me on the Last Day.”

    回应：你的一位朋友说：“我一直在努力过一个正派的生活，公正地对待每一个人，也在爱每一个人。如果神还不能因为我的付出而接纳我，那我猜他只有在审判日惩罚我了。”

    I Corinthians 2:14 The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God.

    林前2：14 然而，属血气的人不领会 神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。

    4-6Is it any wonder that all of the world’s religions have to do with man getting himself out of his sins? Only the Christian faith, which teaches salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone as God’s rescue plan for sinners gets them out of the pit of this world to heaven for eternity.
    
    世间所有的宗教都是人在努力摆脱自己的罪，这有什么奇怪？只有基督徒的信仰教导，人只有通过相信耶稣基督自己、进入神对罪人的拯救计划，才得以脱离这个世界的罪污，进入永恒的天国。

    Ephesians 1:17；18 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance…

    以弗所书 1:17 求我们主耶稣基督的神，荣耀的父，将那赐人智慧和启示的灵赏给你们，使你们真知道他。18：并且照明你们心中的眼睛，使你们知道他的恩召有何等指望，他在使徒中得的基业有何等丰盛的荣耀；

6. As we pray for personal enlightenment, what is the goal or objective of our enlightenment?

    在我们祈求得到圣灵启迪的同时，请思考我们得到启迪的目地和用途是什么？

    Ephesians 2:8-10 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s workmanship, crated in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

    以弗所书2:8-10：你们得救是本乎恩，也因著信。这并不是出于自己，乃是 神所赐的； 也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。 我们原是他的工作，在基督耶稣里造成的，为要叫我们行善，就是神所预备叫我们行的。”

    Let’s break this very important passage of Scripture down:

    我们把这节非常重要的经文分开：

    Grace has ------------- you. And grace is not --------------------. The instrument, which God used to communicate his grace, St. Paul calls -------------. Faith is being ---------- of what we hope for and -------------- of what we do not ----------. Because grace is a gift of God we can all be certain that our ----------- had nothing to do with us. In our sinful condition, salvation was impossible for us to accomplish because of our -------------. After God has emptied us of all pride and self-righteousness, he created a living -------------- in our hearts that now -------------- to his grace. For we are God’s workmanship only in light of the ------------ he created in our hearts. For without ----------- it is impossible to please God. Through faith and the continuing power of the gospel, God has designed us to perform in ----------------. Good works are anything that is done out of ------.

    恩典已经----了你，而且这恩不是------。使徒保罗把神用以传递他恩典的途径称为--------。信是-------我们所盼望的事情，而且--------我们还没有-------的事情。因为恩典是神的礼物，所以我们都可以确定我们的-------和我们无关。在我们罪恶的本性里，救恩不可能靠我们来完成，因为我们是--------。神倒空了我们所有的骄傲和自以为义之后，在我们的心里造了一个活泼的---------, 现在可以------他的恩典，因为只有借助他在我们里面所造的------，我们才可以成为神的工作, 因为没有-------就不能得神的喜悦。透过信心和福音不间断的大能，神已经把预定我们去行-----。善行是从--------发出的任何事情。

    This is how verse 10 of Ephesians 2 breaks down in the Greek: “For we are his [God’s] masterpiece, having been created in Christ Jesus for the purpose of Good works, which God previously prepared [for us], in order that [purpose] in [good works] them we should walk.”

    以弗所书2条10节用希腊语分解开是这样的：“因为我们是他的（神的）杰作，为完成神的善工而在耶稣基督里被创造。这善工是神早先为我们准备好的，使我们能行走在其中。

    If we are in error of this chief article of faith, that all humanity is born into this world without a true fear of God, love for God, or faith in God, then we will ultimately be in error in almost every other chief doctrine of Holy Scripture. An unclear understanding of the doctrine of original sin will ultimately affect a person’s understanding of the following doctrines:

    如果我们在这篇信仰的主要教义上出错，即不承认整个人类自生到这个世界上就对神没有真正的敬畏、不爱神、不相信神的真理，那我们就会最终在圣经任何其它的主要教义上出错。对原罪的教义理解不清楚就会最终影响一个人对下面教义的理解。

    Conversion – 悔改信主

    Baptism –洗礼

    Holy Communion –圣餐


    Justification – 称义

    When certain articles of faith challenge our intellect, our emotions, & feelings, like perhaps the doctrine of original sin, we must always surrender our feelings and emotions to the Word of God.

    当信仰的某些教义向我们的知识、我们的情绪以及我们的感情发出挑战时，比如可能是原罪的教义等，我们必须将我们的感情和情绪置于神话语的掌管之下。

    **Explain this paradox 解释这一矛盾**

    How can Martin Luther call reason both the devil’s damned whore, a blind guide, the enemy of faith, the devil’s bride, the greatest and most invincible enemy of God and then out of the same mouth say that reason is God’s greatest and most important gift to man, of inestimable beauty and excellence, a glorious light, a most useful servant in theology, something divine?

    马丁路德怎么能把理性既称为是恶者该受咒诅的淫妇，瞎眼的向导、信仰的敌人、撒旦的新娘、神最大且最不能征服的敌人，又用同一张口说理性是神赐给人最大最重要的礼物、具有无法估量的美和优点、是荣耀的光、是神学最有用的仆人、是神圣的东西？

    ![](/images/note/ags/4-5.jpg#right)

    **Corrupt at Conception 堕落自胎儿**

    Mankind was created in the image of God. He was created after God in “true righteousness and holiness” (Ephesians 4:24). When God scrutinized his finished work of creation, with man and woman being the final project, he found it to be ------- ---------.

    人类是神按照自己的形像造的，他是神按照自己“真理的仁义和圣洁”（弗4：24）被造出来的。当神细查他完成的创作时，他对所造的最终成果—男人和女人，发现他们-------- -----------。

    Colossians 3:10 also emphasizes the perfect image of God when Paul says, “...and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.”

    歌罗西书3：10, 穿上了新人。这新人在知识上渐渐更新，正如造他主的形像。

    We must understand that man was perfect in every respect as he left the Creator’s hand, and a real fall into sin took place as we see the immediate signs:

    我们必须明白，在人从他的创造者的手中离开时，他在任何一个方面都是完美的，但落入罪中的行动却真实地发生了，因为我们看到了这些随之而来的标记。

    Relationship to God: 与神的关系：

    Relationship to each other: 彼此的关系：

    Self-image: 自我形象：

    Paul reminds us in Romans 5 that when Adam sinned, the whole human race became infected with sin and subject to death.

    保罗在罗马书5章中提醒我们，当亚当犯罪时，整个人类都受到了罪的感染而成为死的俘虏。

    Romans 5:12 “Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.”

    罗马书5:12 “这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的; 于是死就临到众人， 因为众人都犯了罪。

    Some would say that original sin isn’t as dangerous as actual sin, which doesn’t happen until we hit an age of accountability (7 - 11 years of age). How might this passage from Romans say otherwise to this argument?

    有人说，原罪不像真实的犯罪（只有到了7—11岁开始为自身行为负责的年龄才会发生）那样危险。罗马书的经文与这样的观点有什么不同？

    Ephesians 2:3 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.

    以弗所书2:3, 我们从前也都在他们中间，放纵肉体的私欲，随着肉体和心中所喜好的去行，本为可怒之子，和别人一样。

    Paul’s writing to a Christian church, yet not only does he shoot an arrow of the Law at each believer, but also he includes himself in one who gratified his sinful nature. How could he be so sure this included everyone?

    保罗在写给基督教会的信中，不仅向每一个信徒射出了一支律法的箭，他也把自己包括在放纵肉体的私欲的人在内。他怎么能肯定每个人都包括在其中？

    Psalm 51:5 “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”

    诗篇51：5 我是在罪孽里生的， 在我母亲怀胎的时候就有了罪。

7. At what moment? 

    在哪一刻？
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/4-6.jpg#right)
    
    
    
    **Who is affected by this disease? 谁受到了这种疾病的感染？**

    In King Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the temple, he said “…for there is no one who does not sin—and you become angry with them” (I Kings 8:46). It was generally accepted amongst Israel that the Gentiles were sinners; but Solomon emphasizes that even the chosen people of God make the confession that “there is no one who does not sin.”

    所罗门在奉献圣殿的祷告中说：“----世上没有不犯罪的人，你向他们发怒”（王上8：46）。在以色列中普遍接受的观点是：外邦人是罪人；但所罗门强调说，即使是神的选民也承认：“世上没有不犯罪的人。”

    The Psalmist complains: “The LORD looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God. All have turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one” (Psalm 14:2-3). Psalm 53 repeats the complaint of this Psalm in almost the exact same words.

    诗篇的作者诉说道：“耶和华从天上垂看世人，要看有明白的没有，有寻求神的没有。　他们都偏离正路，一同变为污秽；并没有行善的，连一个也没有。 ” （诗14:2-3）.诗篇53篇几乎以完全相同的字眼重复了这一申诉。

    In one of the penitential Psalms (143:2) of King David, he explains his request that the Lord should not enter into judgment with him, his servant, with the remark: “For no one living is righteous before you.”

    在大卫王的一篇忏悔诗（143：2）中，他解释了他的请求，他求神不要审问他—神的仆人。他说道：“因为在你面前，凡活着的人没有一个是义的。”

    In the first 2 chapters of Romans, Paul emphasizes that both Jew and Greek are under the condemnations of God’s holy Law. Then in chapter 3, St. Paul emphatically states, “There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (22,23) In Galatians 3:22, Paul declares that “The whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.”

    在罗马书的前两条中，保罗强调，犹太人和希腊人都在神的圣洁律法的审判之下。后来在第3章中，使徒保罗又强调地申明：“没有分别，因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀（22，23）。” 在加3：22中，保罗宣告：“但圣经把众人都圈在罪里、使所应许的福因信耶稣基督、归给那信的人。”

    Respond: No matter how “religious” a man may be, no matter how sincere his efforts are to do right and to serve God, he is doomed to failure because even his very best efforts are born out of a corrupt heart; he is in and of himself sinful and therefore sinfully motivated in all that he does.

    回应：不管一个人有多“虔诚”，不管行善和服侍神的努力有多真诚，他都注定要失败，因为连他最好的努力都是从一颗堕落的心里发出来的；他在罪中，而且本身就是有罪的，所以在所做的一切事情上都带着有罪的动机。

    Respond: No matter how “innocent” an unborn fetus may appear to be, no matter how cute and cuddly a tiny infant appears to be as we look through our own eye balls, we must confess that when Jesus says, “Flesh gives birth to flesh,” he is saying that even they are corrupt and plagued with the disease of sin, without true fear of God, or reverence for his holy name.

    回应：无论一个未出生的胎儿看起来有多“无辜”，无论一个小婴孩在我们自己的眼中看来有多可爱得让人禁不住要搂入怀中，我们必须承认，当耶稣说：“肉体生的就是肉体”时，他在说，就连那些孩子都已被罪的疾病所腐蚀，所侵害，失去了对神的真实敬畏，对他的圣名没有崇敬。

    Thus, everyone born of natural decent is born in a state of sinfulness. There is only one who was born without the tainting of the flesh and that was Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. He was a true man, who had a perfect human nature consisting of body and soul, subject to all the limitations of the human nature; but he was born “not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John 1:13 KJV). He was conceived by the Holy Spirit as we confess in the Second Article of the Apostle’s Creed.

    因此，每一个以自然方式出生的人都生在了罪中。只有一位生来就没有受到肉体污染的，就是耶稣基督，我们的主和救主。他是真正的人，拥有身体和灵魂的完美人性，受到人性所受的一切限制；但他“不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。”（约1：13）正如我们在使徒信经的第二条中所承认的，他是由圣灵感孕的。

    From his birth, Jesus was the Holy One of God. And when people tried to challenge him and accuse him of sin, he silenced each of them. John 8:46 says, “Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me?”

    从出生起，耶稣就是神的圣子。当人试图向他挑战、指控他有罪时，他让每一个人都缄默不语。约8：46说：“你们中间谁能指证我有罪呢？我既然将真理告诉你们，为什么不信我呢？”

8. Is there a difference between original sin and actual sin?

    原罪和真实的犯罪之间有区别吗？

Original sin is not committed like other sins, as murder, theft, sexual immorality, slander, idolatry, and the like; original sin, rather, is the driving power within us which actuates us and induces us to commit sins. For Jesus once said, “Out of the heart comes…”

原罪不像杀人、盗窃、淫乱、诽谤、拜偶像之类的罪那样犯；原罪是我们里面的驱动力，导致、诱使我们去犯罪。因为耶稣曾说：“---从心发出”。

Unfortunately, people frequently make this an excuse for their sinning. They say, I’m just a worrisome person, or I’ve just been built that way (that I lose my temper). Or I can’t help looking at other women, that’s just what men do.

不幸的是，人们常把这一点当成自己犯罪的借口。他们说，我就是一个容易烦恼的人；或：我生来就这样（爱发脾气）。或者，我忍不住要看其她女人，那就是男人做的事。

Original sin does not excuse sin. Original sin is itself truly sin. Although it is not committed like the actual sins, it yet is the fountainhead of all sins, rendering a man absolutely incapable to please God in any way. Ephesians 2:3 reminds us that by nature we are objects of God’s wrath.

原罪不能宽恕罪行。原罪本身就是真实的罪。虽然它不像实际的罪行一样犯出来，它却是一切罪行的源头，使人完全没有能力以任何方式取悦神。弗2：3提醒我们，我们的本性就是神怒气的对象。

Therefore, it is only through a radical change, a reconstruction of the heart, that we come to God, call to God, worship God, and have a living faith in God. And this radical change must take place from God to us. Read the following…

因此，只有借助一个根本性的改变，一次心灵的重建，我们才能到神面前来，向他呼求，敬拜神，对神产生活的信心。这一根本的改变的发生必须是由神到人的。读下面的经文：

Ezekiel 36:24-29a For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. You will live in the land I gave your forefathers; you will be my people, and I will be your God. I will save you from all your uncleanness…”

以西结书36：24-29上-----24 我必从各国收取你们，从列邦聚集你们，引导你们归回本地。25 我必用清水洒在你们身上，你们就洁净了。我要洁净你们，使你们脱离一切的污秽，弃掉一切的偶像。26 我也要赐给你们一个新心，将新灵放在你们里面，又从你们的肉体中除掉石心，赐给你们肉心。27 我必将我的灵放在你们里面，使你们顺从我的律例，谨守遵行我的典条。28 你们必住在我所赐给你们列祖之地。你们要作我的子民，我要作你们的上帝。29 我必救你们脱离一切的污秽，

John 3:3-6 Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again." 4"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!" 5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.

约翰福音 3：3-6-----3 耶稣回答说：「我实实在在地告诉你，人若不重生，就不能见神的国。」4 尼哥德慕说：「人已经老了，如何能重生呢？岂能再进母腹生出来吗？」5 耶稣说：「我实实在在地告诉你，人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。6 从肉身生的就是肉身；从灵生的就是灵。

This radical change can only take place by God Almighty and the saving arm of his Son, Jesus Christ, working together with the Holy Spirit who calls us to faith in his work of redemption.

这一根本的改变只能由全能的神和他儿子耶稣基督拯救的膀臂，与圣灵一同工作，在救赎的工作中呼吁我们来相信，才能发生。
