Of the Cause of Sin they teach that, although God does create and preserve nature, yet the cause of sin is the will of the wicked, that is, of the devil and ungodly men; which will, unaided of God, turns itself from God, as Christ says John 8:44: When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.

论到罪的根源，他们教导人：上帝虽是创造并保存万物的，但罪的根源是那恶者的意志：就是魔鬼和那不敬虔之人的意志；若上帝不帮助，这意志就离开上帝，如基督所说约翰福音8：44，“他说谎是出于自己”。

The temptation of man has always been to blame God for sin and evil, in spite of the fact that the Bible teaches us clearly that sin is not in God’s vocabulary and his Word spells out very clearly who is responsible for sin and evil in this world. Article 19 describes this important issue for us.

人们总是倾向于将罪和恶的存在怪罪与神, 却忽视圣经清楚的告诉我们这样一个事实，就是罪并不在神的里面，他的话语也很清楚的讲明了是什么带给了这个世界以罪恶。 文章 19 跟我们讲述了这重要的一点。

Genesis 3:12 The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”

创世纪 3:12 那人说，你所赐给我，与我同居的女人，她把那树上的果子给我，我就吃了。


Adam and Eve were created as the crown of God’s creation. After God created them he finished his work of creation and declared everything to be “Very good.” While the relationship was once perfect when God created them, we see disturbing signs of what life would be like after sin entered the world.

亚当和夏娃是神所造的万物之首。 神造了他们之后就歇了一切的工并看万物“都是好的”。当神造他们之初，这种关系是一度完美无缺的， 我们也看到了令人不安的迹象显示了罪进入世界后是怎样不同的一种生活。

1. How had Adam’s view toward’s God, his creator changed after sin entered the world?

    在罪进入世界之后，亚当对于神，他对创造者的态度怎样发生变化？?

2. Can you think of other areas of life where man is tempted to blame God?

    你还能想出其它的一些事情人们总爱去怪罪神么?

    To place blame on God for created us with the ability to sin or to blame God for bad things happening to us in this is blasphemy of his name because the Bible clearly attributes God with love, faithfulness and holiness and that evil comes from the devil and mankind after sinning. Consider the following passages…

    责怪神造了我们却使我们有犯罪的能力或责怪神不管那些发生在我们生命中的坏事是亵渎神的圣名的，因为圣经清楚的告诉我们神的属性乃是爱，是信实的，是圣洁的，而恶乃是出于那恶者和犯罪后的人。阅读下面的文段…

    Psalm 5:4-6 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome. 5 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong; 6 you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, LORD, detest.

    诗篇 5:4-6 因为你不是喜悦恶事的神。恶人不能与你同居。 5 狂傲人不能站在你眼前。凡作孽的，都是你所恨恶的。 6 说谎言的，你必灭绝。好流人血弄诡诈的，都为耶和华所憎恶。

3. What does this Psalm teach us about the realtionship of evil and God?

    这段诗篇告诉我们神和恶的关系是怎么样的?

    Isaiah 65:12 I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will fall in the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”

    以赛亚书 65:12 我要命定你们归在刀下，都必屈身被杀，因为我呼唤，你们没有答应。我说话，你们没有听从。反倒行我眼中看为恶的，拣选我所不喜悦的。

4. Which one is the case (choose a or b)
God destined the people of Israel to the sword and punishment because he never liked the Children of Israel and it brought him great joy to see them suffer.

    The sword was destined for Israel’s slaughter because they chose evil and disobedience to God.

    哪一个是正确的 (选择a或者b)

    a. 神命定以色列人死在刀剑下因为祂从来都不喜欢以色列人，看到他们受苦祂会很高兴。

    b. 对以色列人的惩罚与残杀是因他们选择了恶事并悖逆神的命令。

    When we determine which is the case, not only do we look at what the Scripture says, but we also ask ourselves the simple question, “What brings God the glory?” To answer “a,” would not only be unscriptural, but it would also diminish the glory of God and make him into a monster who loves to see his people suffer pain.

    当我们在选择的时候, 我们不能只看经文字面意思, 我们也要问自己一个简单的问题 , “是什么带给神荣耀?” 如果选择了 “a,” 不只不合原文的意思, 也亏缺了神的荣耀并使祂成为了一个乐于看祂子民受苦的恶者。

    Consider the Reform position on “double election.” They rightly teach as do Lutherans that God has predestined his children for the Kingdom of heaven before the foundation of the world. But they incorrectly teach that God predestines unbelievers to hell. Therefore, they not only violate the very Scriptures that state God’s desire to save all mankind, but they also diminish God’s glory by making him into the author of evil who predetermines hell for many people in this world.

    参考一下改革宗对于“双重预定论”的立场。他们与路德宗一样正确的教导说神为祂的国在创世以先就拣选预定了祂的子民。但是他们不正确的教导说神也预定了不信的人去地狱。这样，他们不但亵渎了圣经所声明的神的意愿是愿所有人得救，而且因为将神置于那使人下地狱的恶者地位而亏缺了神的荣耀。

    Consider for a moment how much God hates sin as revealed to us in the Bible…

    仔细思想一下圣经中揭示的神有多么的恨恶罪恶…

    Zechariah 8:17 do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the LORD.

    撒迦利亚书 8:17谁都不可心里谋害邻舍，也不可喜爱起假誓。因为这些事都为我所恨恶。这是耶和华说的。

5. Can a God who hates sin then be the cause of it? Can he be the one responsible for tempting man into committing sin?

    恨恶罪的神会反而成为罪的原因吗? 祂是应不应该为试探致人犯罪而负责?

James 1:13 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.

雅各书 1:13 人被试探,不可说，我是被神试探。因为神不能被恶试探,他也不试探人。

Let us not forget that God never gave up his original plans that humans should bear his image. Even after the crown of his creation fell into sin, God came forth with an immediate rescue plan to save us from our sins and restore us to a right relationship with him. By the innocent, suffering, and death of Jesus Christ, God has reconciled the world back to himself. And in the strength of Jesus’ merit, God sends to us the Holy Spirit who creates saving faith in our hearts to turn us away from the evils of our flesh and back to him for life and salvation.

我们不要忘记人是神按照自己的样式所造而神也从来没有打算改变祂的计划。就算作为祂荣耀的创造的我们犯了罪, 神也迅速以救恩使我们有可能与祂保持正确的关系而免于沉沦罪中。通过无罪圣洁的耶稣基督为我们受苦受死, 神已使这世界归回向祂。而通过耶稣，神也赐下圣灵来保守我们的心使我们从罪中回转重新归向神，得到新生命和救恩。

To consider what great lengths God goes to in order to save sinners, it’s important that we closely follow what the Bible reveals about our original condition. The Bible does not paint a pretty picture of you and me! Read the following…

回想神为了救罪人而做的种种努力, 我们应当认识到明白圣经显明给我们的关于人本来的景况是非常重要的。圣经并没有为你我粉饰出一段美好的过去! 看经文…

Ephesians 2:1-3 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, 2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 3 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.

以弗所书 2:1-3 你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来，2 那时你们在其中行事为人随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。3 我们从前也都在他们中间，放纵肉体的私欲，随着肉体和心中所喜好的去行，本为可怒之子，和别人一样。

Yet, even though we were objects of God’s wrath, deserving of his eternal punishment, Paul writes this to the Romans…

但是,就算我们是神发怒的对象，应当受到祂永远的惩罚，保罗在罗马书里写道…

Romans 9:22,23 What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—

罗马书 9:22,23 倘若神要显明他的忿怒，彰显他的权能，就多多忍耐宽容那可怒预备遭毁灭的器皿。23 又要将他丰盛的荣耀，彰显在那蒙怜悯早豫备得荣耀的器皿上。

Paul’s point: Everything God does, puts the spotlight on his mercy.

Note the two groups in the world:

1.  The objects of God’s .

2.  The objects of God’s .

保罗的观点: 神行的一切事, 我们应知都出自祂的怜悯。

注意世界里不同的两族:

1.  神 的对象.

2.  神 的对象.

Group #1 is described as “prepared for destruction.” A better translation of the word translated as “prepared” is “fully equipped,” or “ripe,” i.e. they have brought their destruction on themselves

组 #1 被描述为“预备灭亡。” 对“预备”这个词更好的翻译是“完全准备好了”，或“到时候了”。他们自己给自己带来了灭亡。

Group #2 is described as “prepared in advance for glory,” i.e., they are God’s elect from eternity. How does even Group #1 serve God’s gracious purpose?

组 #2 被描述为“准备领受荣耀”。他们是神为永恒所预备的。问题是，就算是第一组的人 #1 ，他们能怎样来服务于神高尚的意愿呢?

God does not look favorably upon those who abuse his grace by taking advantage of his kindness…

神不喜悦那些利用神的怜悯与慈爱滥用祂恩典的人…

Romans 2:4 Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

罗马书 2:4 还是你藐视他丰富的恩慈，宽容，忍耐，不晓得他的恩慈是领你悔改呢?

The cause of all sin and evil is not God, it’s the devil and mankind and to overlook this key teaching could have eternal consequences because God want us to own up to our sin, confess it, and turn to him for forgiveness and salvation. Through Jesus Christ, he offers it to us freely.

所有罪与恶的来源并不是神, 是魔鬼与人，而忽视了这关键的教导就有可能影响你永恒的结局，因为神希望我们认罪悔改，重新转向祂以得到宽恕与救恩。通过耶稣基督，祂给我们预备了白白的救恩。
