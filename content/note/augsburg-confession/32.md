It has been the general persuasion, not of the people alone, but also of those teaching in the churches, that making Distinctions of Meats, and like traditions of men, are works profitable to merit grace, and able to make satisfactions for sins. And that the world so thought, appears from this, that new ceremonies, new orders, new holy-days, and new fastings were daily instituted, and the teachers in the churches did exact these works as a service necessary to merit grace, and did greatly terrify men's consciences, if they should omit any of these things.  From this persuasion concerning traditions much detriment has resulted in the Church.

不但是人民，而且也是教会作师傅的，都以食物的分别及这类属人的遗传为有益于赚恩补罪的功德。世人有这种思想，可于天天设立新仪文，新会社，新节期，新禁食的事上表明出来：教会作师傅的竟强定这些事为博取恩典所不可少的功德；如有人减省什么，他们就大大恐吓人的良心。于是从这种对于遗传的意见上教会生出了许多弊害。

Here, a complaint is raised sighting the fact that common people who attended church were being misled as they were taught that grace could be merited by these man-made traditions. Sadder yet, there were many teachers who had misunderstood the practice of abstaining from certain foods during certain holy days during the Chritian church year.

很多参加教会的人都被误导因为他们教导靠这些人定的规条人可以赢得恩典，这样就引起了异议。更让人痛心的是有很多的教师对一年中某些日子不能吃某种食物这些教条都有错误的看法。

So the Lutherans pointed out that simple hearts of faith were being burdened in their conscience and threatened with grievous sins if they failed in the prompt observance of the prescribed fastings.

所以路德宗指出如果有人没能严格的遵守禁食的规条那么单纯的信心就良心不安，被严重的罪所威胁。

#### A. Three Dangerous Errors of the False Idea 这种错误观点产生的三大危险性错误

First, the doctrine of grace and of the righteousness of faith has been obscured by it, which is the chief part of the Gospel, and ought to stand out as the most prominent in the Church, in order that the merit of Christ may be well known, and faith, which believes that sins are forgiven for Christ's sake be exalted far above works. Wherefore Paul also lays the greatest stress on this article, putting aside the Law and human traditions, in order to show that Christian righteousness is something else than such works, to wit, the faith which believes that sins are freely forgiven for Christ's sake. But this doctrine of Paul has been almost wholly smothered by traditions, which have produced an opinion that, by making distinctions in meats and like services, we must merit grace and righteousness. In treating of repentance, there was no mention made of faith; only those works of satisfaction were set forth; in these the entire repentance seemed to consist.

因为，第一，恩典与由信而来之义的教理受了蒙蔽；这教理原是福音的第一要旨，是至应表彰，为教会所推崇的，好叫基督的功劳得以显明，并叫因信基督罪得赦免的信得以高举，远超乎善功之上。因这缘故，保罗多注重此点：他丢开律法与人的遗传，为要表明基督的义与这类善功大大不同；就是相信因基督的缘故白白得以赦罪。但保罗的这教理差不多全然被遗传蒙蔽了，从遗传上生出了一种意见，谓人应该靠分别食物与行这类的事赚恩称义。在他们悔改的教理上不说到信；单说到这些补罪的善功：好像悔改全在乎这些事。

Notes:

注：

This part of the article stresses the most dangerous part of the article. If a person believes that if they abstain from eating meat on Friday and in so doing, merit grace from God and partial forgiveness for their sins, then how can they believe in the full atonement of Christ? They can’t, which makes the theology of Rome so disastrous for simple hearts of faith trying to cling to Jesus’ work alone for forgiveness, life, and salvation.

文章这一部分着重讨论的也是本篇最危险的一部分。如果人相信通过周五不吃肉就可以赢得神的恩典和赦免部分的罪那么他们又怎么会相信基督的完全的救赎呢？他们不会的，这样罗马神学给相信赦罪、生命和救恩都在耶稣里的单纯的信心带来的影响就是灾难性的。

The apostle Paul, in both the book of Romans and the book of Galatians, points out to his hearers that if people believe in meriting their own grace, they lose the grace of God and the merits of Christ and are lost! The Law of God simply can’t bring life to a sinner; all it can achieve is a painful reminder to us of our sin. Righteousness comes to us by faith in the free forgivenes won for us in Jesus.

保罗在罗马书和加拉太书中告诉听众如果人相信自己可以赢得恩典，他们就失去了神的恩典，就是失丧的人了！神的律法并不能给罪人生命；律法的功用就是刺痛我们让我们认识到自己的罪。称义是因着相信基督给我们的白白的救恩。

Secondly, these traditions have obscured the commandments of God, because traditions were placed far above the commandments of God. Christianity was thought to consist wholly in the observance of certain holy-days, rites, fasts, and vestures. These observances had won for themselves the exalted title of being the spiritual life and the perfect life. Meanwhile the commandments of God, according to each one's calling, were without honor namely, that the father brought up his offspring, that the mother bore children, that the prince governed the commonwealth,—these were accounted works that were worldly and imperfect, and far below those glittering observances. And this error greatly tormented  devout consciences, which grieved that they were held in an imperfect state of life, as in marriage, in the office of magistrate; or in other civil ministrations; on the other hand, they admired the monks and such like, and falsely imagined that the observances of such men were more acceptable to God.

第二，上帝的命令受了遗传的蒙蔽，因为人把遗传远置于上帝的命令之上。他们以为基督教是全在乎遵守节期，礼仪，禁食，装束。这些事得了最尊贵的名义，人以为它们是属灵的生活，完全的生活。但上帝所吩咐各人的职分如父亲教养子女，母亲乳抚子女，君王治理国事，反倒被视为价值低微，被称为世俗之事，不完全的，远逊于遵守那些炫耀的事。这种错误使虔诚人的良心大受痛苦，心里忧愁，以为他们婚嫁，做官，或担任别的人事的职务乃是为不完全的生活所累住，他们钦佩修道士一类的人，错认他们所遵行的在上帝面前更多蒙悦纳。

Notes:

注：

The false opinion concerning meats is devastating in that not only does it hold out false hope to the sinner who observes these ordinances, but also, these traditions aren’t even commanded by God in the Bible! If Christians get the idea that the holy observences set up by the church achieve higher grace then Christians who observe them will quickly turn into Pharisees or self-righteous sinners and Christians who “slip” in their observance of these festivals will quickly despair of themselves.

关于肉类的错误观点是非常有破坏性的因为它不仅给守规条的罪人错误的盼望而且这根本不是神在圣经里要求的！如果基督徒认为守这些教会的规条会会得到更多的恩典那么他们就会成为法利赛人陷入自义中，守这些规条的基督徒一有“跌倒”便会落入绝望之中。

God has assigned a certain station or stations for each one of us. This we call our vocation. People are sons, daughters, moms, dads, husbands, wives, workers and whatever else. And the works of these stations of life, when done out of faith in Jesus, are just as pleasing to God as a person who becomes a minister or teacher in the church.

上帝给我们每个人一个或多个身份，我们称之为使命。人是儿子、女儿、妈妈、爸爸、丈夫、妻子、工人等等。跟生活中的这些身份有关的事只要我们是出于在耶稣里的信心的去做的，都是跟教会牧师或教师一样蒙神喜悦的。

Since most Christians live an ordinary life, their consciences often trouble them because they feel guilt from their conscience and the Law of God, and then when the church holds before their eyes that men who dedicate themselves full time to the ministry are more admirable than they, there is guilt-trip that naturally follows and this also, should not be.

大部分基督徒都是过着普通人的生活，因此他们的良心就经常不安，因为他们感觉有愧于良心和神的律法，当教会告诉他们全职服侍的人比他们更高一等时他们心中自然就会产生愧疚感，而这是不应该的。

Thirdly, traditions brought great danger to consciences; for it was impossible to keep all traditions, and yet men judged these observances to be necessary acts of worship. Gerson writes that many fell into despair, and that some even took their own lives, because they felt that they were not able to satisfy the traditions, and they had all the while not heard any consolation of the righteousness of faith and grace. We see that the summists and theologians gather the traditions, and seek mitigations whereby to ease consciences, and yet they do not sufficiently unfetter, but sometimes entangle, consciences even more.  And with the gathering of these traditions, the schools and sermons have been so much occupied that they have had no leisure to touch upon Scripture, and to seek the more profitable doctrine of faith, of the cross, of hope, of the dignity of civil affairs of consolation of sorely tried consciences.  Hence Gerson and some other theologians have grievously complained that by these strivings concerning traditions they were prevented from giving attention to a better kind of doctrine. Augustine also forbids that men's consciences should be burdened  with such observances, and prudently advises Januarius that he must know that they are to be observed as things indifferent; for such are his words.

第三，遗传大有危害于人的良心，因为人万不能尽守一切遗传，然而人仍以遵守遗传为必须的。格尔森（Gerson）写道：“许多人因见不能遵守遗传，坠入绝望之境，有的甚至于自杀。”这些人从未听见由因信或恩典称义而来的安慰。我们见苏马派人（Summists）与神学之士征集遗传，企图予以限定想藉此减轻人良心的重担；但他们不但没有释放人的良心，反倒有时越发增加良心的网罗。在学校中与讲道台上人为搜集遗传忙碌，以至于无暇讲解圣经，发现多有益处的教理，就是论信，十字架，盼望，各种人事的尊贵，与良心在困苦中可得安慰的教理。所以格尔森与若干神学家曾大大抱怨说，他们受遗传的辩论阻碍，以致不能研究多有益处的教理。奥古斯丁禁止人用这类遗传压制人的良心，并很谨慎地劝勉雅努雅流（Januarius）应当明白遵守遗传为无关重要之事；因为这是他的话。

Notes:

注：

If a distinction of meats is observed in the church then both the Law and the Gospel will be covered up. And here’s why: The Law teaches us the will of God, what it is he wants us to do and those things that he doesn’t want us to do. And the distinction of meats is nowhere commanded by God so his Law is violated. Also, the gospel is covered up because it teaches a person a false way of getting right with God.

如果在教会中守这些戒荤的规条那么律法和福音就被人忽略了。原因是这样的：律法告诉我们神的心意，告诉我们神要我们做的和禁止我们做的。戒荤并不是神的命令因此违反神的律法。另外福音被忽略是因为它教导人一种错误的与神和好的方法。

Again, we see St. Augustine quoted to teach Rome that this is the same opinion held by the esteemed church fathers.

我们再一次引用圣奥古斯丁的话来告诉罗马教会这些德高望重的教会前辈们也有相同的看法。

Wherefore our teachers must not be looked upon as having taken up this matter rashly or from hatred of the bishops, as some falsely suspect. There was great need to warn the churches of these errors, which had arisen from misunderstanding the traditions.  For the Gospel compels us to insist in the churches upon the doctrine of grace, and of the righteousness of faith; which, however, cannot be understood, if men think that they merit grace by observances of their own choice.

因此不要让别人认为我们的老师轻慢的对待这个问题或出于对主教的仇恨，有些人可能会这样臆想。非常有必要警告教会防范这些因为误解传统而产生的错误。因为福音要我在教会中坚持恩典和因信称义的教导；若是有人以为靠自己守规条可以赢得恩典他们就不能明白这样的教导。

Notes:

注：

The Lutherans were accused of blocking progress in the church by speaking out against the traditions of the church. But they simply warned against the errors that had crept into the practice of their traditions. It is imperative that the message of free grace be kept clean of any pollution of man’s own achievements.

有人指责路德宗因为反对教会传统而阻碍了教会的前进。但殊不知路德宗只是警告人们守传统时不要误入歧途。必须要保证白白恩典的信息清洁而没有人的行为的掺杂。

#### B. Observance of Human Traditions is No Meritorious Act of Worship 守人的传统于敬拜神是无用的

Thus, therefore, they have taught that by the observance of human traditions we cannot merit grace or be justified, and hence we must not think such observances necessary acts of worship.  They add hereunto testimonies of Scripture. Christ, Matt. 15:3, defends the Apostles who had not observed the usual tradition, which, however, evidently pertains to a matter not unlawful, but indifferent, and to have a certain affinity with the purifications of the Law, and says, Matt. 15:9, In vain do they worship Me with the commandments of men.  He, therefore, does not exact an unprofitable service. Shortly after He adds: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man. So also Paul, Rom. 14:17: The kingdom of God is not meat and drink.  Col. 2:16: Let no man, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the Sabbath-day; also: If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances: Touch not, taste not, handle not! And Peter says, Acts 15:10: Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. Here Peter forbids to burden the consciences with many rites,  either of Moses or of others. And in 1 Tim. 4:1,3 Paul calls the prohibition of meats a doctrine of devils; for it is against the Gospel to institute or to do such works that by them we may merit grace, or as though Christianity could not exist without such service of God.

他们教导守这些人的传统并不能使我们赢得恩典或称义，因此我们不应该认为守传统是敬拜神必须的。他们有以圣经为根据。基督，太15:3为没有守传统的使徒们辩护，这样的事显然不是违背律法的而是无关紧要的，跟律法的洁净有一定的关系，然后太15:9他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。他从不要人枉然的来拜他。随即他说入口的不能污秽人。同样保罗，罗 14:17：因为神的国，不在乎吃喝。西2:16所以不拘在饮食上，或节期，月朔，安息日，都不可让人论断你们。你们若是与基督同死，脱离了世上的小学，为什么仍像在世俗中活着，服从那不可拿，不可尝，不可摸，等类的规条呢。彼得也说，使徒行传15:10现在为什么试探神，要把我们祖宗和我们所不能负的轭，放在门徒的颈项上呢。我们得救，乃是因主耶稣的恩，和他们一样，这是我们所信的。彼得在这里禁止用规条来辖制良心，包括摩西的和其他人的。在提前 4:1,3保罗称禁戒食物是鬼魔的道理；因为为了赢得恩典而去设立或遵守这些规条或 好像如果不这样服侍主就没有基督教一样，这是与福音相违背的。

Notes:

注：

Every one of the passages listed up above further prove that human traditions that are bound on a believer are deadly to their faith and conscience and therefore must be rejected and considered a doctrine of devils. No matter how harmless a tradition may be in itself, if it is practiced for the purpose of meriting grace, it overthrows the gospel which proclaims a perfectly free grace.

以上所列的经文进一步证明了强加在信徒身上的传统对信心和良心是致命的也使我们应该拒绝的鬼魔的道理。不管一个传统本身是多么没有害处，如果守传统是为了赢得恩典，这就是对传完全的、白白的恩典的福音的弃绝。

Here our adversaries object that our teachers are opposed to discipline and mortification of the flesh, as Jovinian. But the contrary may be learned from the writings of our teachers. For they have always taught concerning the cross that it behooves Christians to bear afflictions. This is the true, earnest, and unfeigned mortification, to wit, to be exercised with divers afflictions, and to be crucified with Christ.

说到这里，那些抵挡我们的人反对我们说，我们的传道人正如约维年（Jovinian）所行的，阻碍节制与攻克肉体之事。但从我们传道人的著作上看，就知其不然。因为论到十字架，他们常常教导人基督徒应当忍受苦难。那真实，恳切，无伪的克己，就是用诸般苦难试炼自己，并且与基督同钉十字架。

Notes:

注：

From the fact that we deny the meritorious character of human traditions, our opponents at once jump to the conclusion that we neglect self-discipline and do not properly mortify our flesh. Everybody can readily see that such an argument is not valid. Meriting grace and disciplining oneself are two totally different viewpoints.

从我们反对人的传统可以赢得恩典这样的事实我们的对手得出结论说我们忽略了自律并且没有恰当的对付肉体。每个人都可以很容易的看出这样的论断纯属无稽之谈。赢得恩典和自律是完全不同的两回事。

Discipline is very necessary. Due to the presence and the activity of the old Adam in us, it is difficult to lead a Christian life. To curb the old Adam, God uses the cross and lays trials on us. This then is real self-discipline that we bear our cross patiently and cheerfully perform our Christian duties, giving thanks to God.

自律是非常必要的。由于老亚当在我们里面的存在和搅扰使我们很难过基督徒的生活。为了对付老亚当，神用十字架来试炼我们。我们忍耐背十字架并且存喜乐感恩的心来尽自己的本分才是真正的自律。

Jovinian was excommunicated by the bishop of Rome because he opposed celibacy and an ascetic life. This was in 390. He died about 15 years later. He himself had led an ascetic life at first, and he remained unmarried his whole life. But he considered fasting as no more important or meritorious and pleasing to God than the enjoyment of food when received with thanksgiving. Because of these views he was branded as a “heretic” by his contemporaries.

尤文安因为反对独身生活和禁欲主义而被罗马主教逐出教会。这发生在390年。之后15年尤文安去世。他最开始也是过禁欲的生活终身未婚。但是他认为与禁食相比心存感恩的心领受食物更重要、更好也更蒙神悦纳 。因为他的这些观点他被同时代的人划为“异端”。

Moreover, they teach that every Christian ought to train and subdue himself with bodily restraints, or bodily exercises and labors that neither satiety nor slothfulness tempt him to sin, but not that we may merit grace or make satisfaction for sins by such exercises. And such external discipline ought to be urged at all times, not only on a few and set days. So Christ commands,  Luke 21:34: Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.; alsoMatt. 17:21: This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. Paul also says, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under my body and bring it into subjection.  Here he clearly shows that he was keeping under his body, not to merit forgiveness of sins by that discipline, but to have his body in subjection and fitted for spiritual things, and for the discharge of duty according to his calling. Therefore, we do not condemn fasting in itself, but the traditions which prescribe certain days and certain meats, with peril of conscience, as though such works were a necessary service.

他们又教导人，每一个基督徒应当藉身体的训练或身体的运动与辛勤操练管辖自己，不受丰富与安闲激动而犯罪；但他并不是靠这类操练赚恩补罪。又当常常举行身体的操练，不是单在一两日与节期之中；正如基督所吩咐的说：路加福音21:34“你们要谨慎，恐怕因贪食醉酒累住你们的心”。又说：太17:12“这一类的鬼若不祷告禁食他就不出来”。保罗说林前9:27“我是攻克己身，叫身服我。”：这是他明明白白告诉人他攻克自己的身子，不是藉修炼得蒙赦罪，乃是叫身子与属灵之事相称，照着他所蒙的召尽他的本分。所以就禁食的本身说，我们并不弃绝禁食，但弃绝那定某日禁食，某种食物可吃，某种食物不可吃，以致危及良心的遗传，仿佛这类事是不可少的功德。

Notes:

注：

This paragraph deals with self-discipline and reminds us that it is recommended, not only certain days only but always, for the purpose of keeping oneself fitted for spiritual things and for the discharge of the duties of one’s calling, since overindulgence in food and drink and in sleep and the pleasures of life unfits one in his spiritual journey.

这一段讨论自律和提醒我们自律不仅在某些日子而且要常常，为的使我们能够承受属灵的事情和服侍我们的呼召，因为贪食醉酒和懒惰放纵会使人在灵程上失落。

Nevertheless, very many traditions are kept on our part, which conduce to good order in the Church, as the Order of Lessons in the Mass and the chief holy-days. But, at the same time, men are warned that such observances do not justify before God, and that in such things it should not be made sin if they be omitted without offense.  Such liberty in human rites was not unknown to the Fathers.  For in the East they kept Easter at another time than at Rome, and when, on account of this diversity, the Romans accused the Eastern Church of schism, they were admonished by others that such usages need not be alike everywhere. And Irenaeus says: Diversity concerning fasting does not destroy the harmony of faith; as also Pope Gregory intimates in Dist. XII, that such diversity does not violate the unity of the Church.  And in the Tripartite History, Book 9, many examples of dissimilar rites are gathered, and the following statement is made: It was not the mind of the Apostles to enact rules concerning holy-days, but to preach godliness and a holy life [to teach faith and love].

然而我们为使教会可按次序行事，还是遵守大半的遗传；如弥撒经课的次序与主要的节期都照常遵守。但我们同时教导人，不可以为遵守这些仪文是叫人在上帝面前称义；也不可以为不遵守这些仪文是罪，除非因此叫人跌倒。这种属乎人的仪文的自由，古教父已经知道。因为东方教会与罗马教会所守的复活节并不同为一日。罗马教会曾控东方教会因这种分别使教会分裂，就有人劝勉他们说，这类规矩各处不必尽同。爱任纽（Irenaeus）说：“在禁食上不同，无损于信仰的合一。”此外教皇贵钩利也曾暗示这种分别并不破坏教会的合一（The 12th Distinction）又三部史卷九曾搜集许多仪文不同的例证，并且说，“使徒的意思不在乎颁节令的教训，乃在乎传敬虔与圣洁的生活（信与爱）。”［传讲信和爱］。

Notes:

注;

Good order is necessary in the church, and as far as traditions serve this purpose, they should be observed – not, however, with the idea of meriting justification.

教会中好的秩序是必要的，如果传统是为了这一目的，那就应该遵守它们—但不是为了赢得称义。

Irenaeus was bishop of Lyons in France, where he died about AD 202. His home country was Asia Minor, where Polycarp was his teacher. In the controversy concerning the proper date of celebrating Easter, he pleaded with the bishop of Rome for Christian liberty. The Gregory mentioned here is Gregory the Great, who died in 604.

爱任纽是法国里昂主教，与公元202年在此去世。他的家乡是在小亚细亚，也是他师从玻里加的地方。在关于复活节具体日期的争辩中他向罗马主教请求给基督徒自由。这里提到的格雷戈里是大格雷戈里，去世于604年。
