The Lutheran church is a confessional church, which means that it adheres to a set of documents that were drawn up by Martin Luther and his successors because they are an accurate dissertation of the Holy Scriptures.

路德宗教会是一个具有宗派性质的教会。该教会遵循由马丁路德和他的继承者制定的一套信仰纲要。这套纲要对圣经有着极为精确的阐释。

#### Luther in Augsburg 路德在奥格斯堡

There are two important events involving Martin Luther that took place in Augsburg. The first was that Luther was called to Augsburg October 12 to 18, 1518 to meet with Cardinal Thomas Cajetan and be examined on his teachings; this interview followed the 1518 Diet of Augsburg (the parliament of German Princes and Dukes).

马丁路德参与了发生在奥格斯堡的两个重要事件。第一件是马丁路德在1518年10月12至18日被要求在奥格斯堡与红衣主教托马斯卡节坦会面。这次会面也要对路德的教义作严格审查，之后便是1518年的奥格斯堡国家会议（德国王室和公爵议会）。

The purpose of the meeting was simple. Luther was to recant his positions on indulgences, justification by faith, and the authority of the Pope. Luther refused to recant. Cardinal Cajetan's instructions were that if Luther failed to recant, Luther was to be arrested and sent to Rome. Luther's supporters got wind of this, and helped Luther escape the night on October 20th. Luther returned to Wittenburg a hunted man. The pope put a bounty on his head that allowed anyone to take the life of Martin Luther and be protected under the law of the land.

这次会议的目的很简单，就是要路德声明放弃有关赦罪、因信称义以及教皇特权的主张。因为路德拒绝作出这样的声明，红衣主教卡节坦便指示，如果路德不声明放弃，他就要被逮捕谴送到罗马。路德的支持者得到这个消息后，在10月20日晚帮助路德逃离。路德作为一个通缉犯回到威特堡。教皇发出赏金，允许任何人取走路德的性命，而且路德也不再受到当地法律的保护。

The second event in Augsburg was also very important. Charles V convened a Diet to meet at Augsburg in 1530 to address unresolved religious issues. Phillip Melanchthon was Luther's representative (Luther was still in hiding) at the meeting and a primary author of the Augsburg Confession (of faith). The Augsburg Confession is the definitive statement of faith for Lutherans.

在奥格斯堡的第二个事件也很重要。查尔斯五世针对未解决的宗教问题于1530年在奥格斯堡召开国会。菲力普-默朗松是路德的在会代表（路德仍在逃离中），也是奥格斯堡信仰纲要的主要作者。奥格斯堡信仰纲要是路德宗教会对信仰的权威宣言。

What makes the Augsburg Confession so unique is that not only is it the primary confession of the Lutheran Church, but it was the laity (German princes) who presented this beautiful, theological confession of faith to Emperor Charles V at the Diet (meeting) of Augsburg on June 25, 1530. That date is generally considered the birth of the Lutheran church. The doctrine of Justification by grace through faith is the central theme of the entire document and fills every article of faith that is discussed.

奥格斯堡信仰纲要的独特之处不仅在于它是路德宗教会的主要信仰宣言，还因为它是由神职人员之外的德国亲王们把这一漂亮的神学信仰宣言在1530年6月25日的奥格斯堡国家会议上呈给了国王查利五世。那一天也被认为是路德宗教会的诞生日。因信而被神的恩典称义的教义是整个纲要的中心主题，充满在被讨论的每一个信条中。

Up till 1530 Luther and his followers had not really entertained the thought of separating from the Catholic Church and of forming a new distinct church body. Even in 1529, they were still a part of the body of the Roman Catholic Church and were called Protestants (protesting the Catholic faith). But when in 1530 at Augsburg they submitted a confession of their own, which was formally condemned by their Catholic opponents, a new church body was born out of necessity.

直到1530年，路德和他的跟随者才真正开始考虑从天主教会分离出来，建立一个新的独立的教会。即使在1529年，他们也还是罗马天主教会的一部分，被称为新教（意为“反对天主教信仰”的教会）。但是1530年在奥格斯堡，他们呈递了一份自己的信仰宣言，这份宣言曾一度被他们的天主教反对者严厉谴责过，但一个新的教会应时而生

But let us not forget this one thing. Luther, himself, was not a sectarian trying to gain followers for himself as though these documents were somehow “his” teachings. No, Luther and his followers tried their best to purify the church by restoring the Word of God to its highest prominence that all of doctrine would be established by the Word of God and not by man’s opinion or human tradition. Luther always prized the church as one universal body, which we confess as the “Communion of saints,” and he was very concerned about keeping that unity in the visible church as well – but not at the expense of having to compromise the truth of the Holy Bible.

但是让我们不要忘记这一点：路德本人并不是一个偏执狭隘的人，试图在为自己赢得跟随者，把那些纲要看作是“自己”的教义。不是，路德和他的跟随者在尽他们最大的努力洁净教会，让神的话语恢复到它本该有的最高位置，使一切的教义都建立在神话语的基础上，而不是建立在人的意见或人类的传统上。路德一直把教会视为一个普世的整体，即我们所宣告的“圣徒的联合”。他也非常关心保持地上有形教会的合一，但却不是以妥协圣经真理为代价。

From this study, we will see something that Jesus already told us in God’s Word when he said, 34"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn " 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law - 36a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.' 37"Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:34-37).

从这个学习中，我们将会看到耶稣在神的话语中已经告诉我们的事情。他说：“34你们不要想，我来是叫地上太平；我来并不是叫地上太平，乃是叫地上动刀兵。35因为我来是叫人与父亲生疏，女儿与母亲生疏，媳妇与婆婆生疏。36人的仇敌就是自己家里的人。37爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；”（太10：34-37）

With these words of our precious Savior, we are reminded that his Word will do one of two things to the people of this world – either unite us or divide us and sometimes that division goes right through the members of one’s own family.

我们的宝贵救主说的这些话提醒我们，他的话会在这个世上的人中间产生两种结果：要么将我们凝聚在一起，要么将我们分开。有时这种分裂就发生在一个人的家庭中。

As Christians grow in their faith, they will also see through this study that faith mandates a response of what we believe. It is not enough to tell someone that you believe in Jesus. For people today have made Jesus into the greatest false god by denying the plain Scriptural truths of what the Bible tells us about Jesus. Some say he’s a great prophet, but not true God; some say that he’s one of many ways into heaven, but not the only way. Anything short of what the Bible reveals to us about Jesus is idolatry. It’s important, therefore, that Christians know the Jesus of the Bible and are prepared to defend their faith according to the Bible just as the following passages remind us…

随着基督徒信心的增长，他们也将会从这个学习中看到，信心会指示我们对所信内容作出何种反应，只对别人说你相信耶稣还不够，因为今天的人否认圣经所记载的有关耶稣的明了真理，已经把耶稣当成了最大的假神。有人说他是一个大先知，而不是真神。有人说他是通往天国的很多方法之一，而不是唯一的方法。任何对耶稣的说法，只要不是像圣经所启示的那样完整，就是在崇拜偶像。因此，基督徒要认识圣经中的耶稣。就像下面的经文所提醒的，我们要做好准备以圣经为根据来护卫我们的信仰，这一点很重要。

1 Peter 3:15 But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.

彼得前书3：15只要心里尊主基督为圣。有人问你们心中盼望的缘由，就要常作准备，以温柔、敬畏的心回答个人。

1. How does a person prepare to give others answers about their faith?

    一个人应当怎样做好准备回答别人提出的有关自己信仰的问题？

    Matthew 12:34 For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.

    太12：34因为心里所充满的，口里就说出来。

2. How do you recognize a false teacher?

    你怎样识别假教师？

3. What if a teacher of God’s Word teaches 95% of the truth, but 5% of his/her teaching is not Scriptural and false? Does the Bible consider him/her a false teacher?

    假如一个圣经教师教导的是95%的真理，而5%不是出自圣经的错误内容怎么办？圣经认为他/她是假教师吗？

    Romans 10:9,10 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.

    罗马书10：9，10你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。因为人心里相信，就可以称义；口里承认，就可以得救。

4. What relationship exists between the heart that believes and the mouth that confesses?

    一颗相信的心和一张承认主名的口之间存在着怎样的关系？

    Matthew 10:32 "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.”

    太10：32“凡在人面前认我的，我在我天父 的面前也必认他。”

5. How do Christians “acknowledge” Jesus?
    
    基督徒怎样“承认”耶稣？

    Luke 9:26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.

    路9：26“凡把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在自己的荣耀里，并天父与圣天使的荣耀里降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。”

6. What are the consequences of covering up known and accepted Scriptural truths that are clearly laid out for us in the Word of God?

    对于已经在神的话语中清楚表明出来的圣经真理，一个人如果已经了解而且接受，但却故意遮掩的话，会有什么后果？

    The faith that unites Christians to their Savior also unites them with one another; as it makes them children of God, it also makes them brothers and sisters among themselves. The way in which they recognize each other is by being united in mind and thought as St. Paul teaches us in the following words…

    信心将基督徒与他们的救主合而为一，也将他们彼此联合为一体，就像信心使他们成为神的儿女，同时也使他们成为弟兄姐妹一样。他们能够认识彼此，就是因为他们的思想意念已经合一，正如使徒保罗在下面的话语中所教导的一样：

    1 Corinthians 1:10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.

    林前1：10 “弟兄们，我藉我们主耶稣基督的名，劝你们都说一样的话。你们中间也不可分党，只要一心一意，彼此相合。”

7. Why does Paul desire “perfect” unity in the body of Christ?

    保罗为什么期望能够在基督的身体里“完美”地合一？

8. How should the body of believers reach “perfect” unity?

    信徒应该怎样达到“完美”的合一？

    Ephesians 4:14-16 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

    以弗所书4：14-16“使我们不再作小孩子，中了人的诡计和欺骗的法术，被一切异教之风摇动，漂来漂去，就随从各样的异端。唯用爱心说诚实话，凡事长进，连于元首基督。全身都靠他联络得合式，百节各按各职，照着各体的功用彼此相助，便叫身体渐渐增长，在爱中建立自己。”

9. How does Paul teach us in this passage that the idea of “agreeing to disagree” is a dangerous way of life inside of the Christian faith?

    保罗为什么在这段经文中告诉我们说，“同意有不同”在基督信仰内部是一种危险的生活方式？

The Christian’s common confession of faith binds them together, but at the same time separates them from unbelievers and false teachers. This, too, is extremely important lest the child of faith become confused and disbelieving because of heretics. Listen to the following words of Scripture…

基督徒共同的信仰宣言将他们连接在一起，但同时也把他们与不信的人与假教师分开。这一点对信主的人也极其重要，免得因为异教邪说而受迷惑甚至不信。听听 下面的经文：1-12

![](/images/note/ags/1-7.jpg#right) 

Romans 16:17 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.

罗马书16：17 “弟兄们，那些离间你们，叫你们跌倒，背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。”

Matthew 7:15,16 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them.

马太福音：7：15，16 “你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。”

God’s desire for us in his Word is to strengthen the unity that exists in the body of Christ by growing in his Word together. Any compromise of the Word of God is a denial of the truth and will ultimately lead to greater denials in the end. Read the following…

在他的话语中，神对我们的心意是要我们通过在他的话语中一起成长而加强存在于基督身体里的联合。对神话语的任何妥协都是对真理的否认，最终将会导致末了更大的否认。读下面的经文：

Ephesians 4:3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

以弗所书4：3 “竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。”

Hebrews 10:25 Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

希伯来书10：25 “你们不可停止聚会，好象那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。”

2 Timothy 1:8 So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.

提摩太后书1：8 “你不要以给我们的主作见证为耻，也不要以我这为主被囚的为耻。总要按神的能力，与我为福音同受苦难。”

In studying the several articles of the Augsburg Confession, we shall see how they serve a double purpose.

通过学习奥格斯堡信仰宣言的信条，我们看到它们的双重目的：

1) Uniting us in the true faith, founded on God’s Word alone and confessed by Christians of all ages.

1）让基督徒在真正的信仰中联合。这信仰是单单建立在神的话语上，且被历史历代的基督徒所公认的。

2) Saving us from an unhealthy unionism with “Christians” who aren’t interested in what the Word of truth says, but rather interested in a generic Christianity that really stands for nothing.

2）拯救我们脱离与那些对真理的话语不感兴趣的“基督徒”之间的不健康的联合。这些所谓的基督徒只是对基督教感兴趣，而实际里面毫无意义。

May God richly bless our study of the Augsburg Confession as we study the following articles of the Christian faith…
