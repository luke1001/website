Of Civil Affairs they teach that lawful civil ordinances are good works of God, and that it is right for Christians to bear civil office, to sit as judges, to judge matters by the Imperial and other existing laws, to award just punishments, to engage in just wars, to serve as soldiers, to make legal contracts, to hold property, to make an oath when required by the magistrates, to marry a wife, to be given in marriage. They condemn the Anabaptists who forbid these civil offices to Christians. They condemn also those who do not place evangelical perfection in the fear of God and in faith, but in forsaking civil offices; for the Gospel teaches an eternal righteousness of the heart. Meanwhile, it does not destroy the State or the family, but very much requires that they be preserved as ordinances of God, and that charity be practiced in such ordinances. Therefore, Christians are necessarily bound to obey their own magistrates and laws, save only when commanded to sin; for then they ought to obey God rather than men. Acts 5:29

关于民事他们教导合法的典章制度是神的善工，基督徒可以承担政府职位，可以做法官，依国家或其它法律辨善恶，赏善罚恶，参与正义之战，去服兵役，依法订立合同，享有物权，在执政者要求时发誓，娶妻，过婚姻生活。他们指责再受洗派禁止基督徒从事这些事务。他们指责那些不把福音事工的完善放在敬畏神和信心之上却放在禁止承担政府职位之上的人；因为福音的教导使人心称义。它不仅不危害国家和家庭而且要根据神的典章来建立它们，并且要让爱在其中得到彰显。因此，基督徒要顺服法律和执政掌权的，除非被要求做犯罪的事；因为基督徒要顺从神不顺从人。使徒行传 5:29

By Civil Affairs, our article now takes special interest in the life of a Christian in company with the people of this world. How we fit into a society or certain nation or community.

本篇探讨民事是为了关注基督徒在生活中与他人相处的问题。是我们如何融入这个社会或民族或群体的问题。

First off, let’s understand that if we lived alone on an island, where our behavior could not affect the behavior of another, there would be no need for communal rules and regulations. But of course, God has made us to be social beings, which means that there must be social order in order for a society to function.

首先我们应该理解如果我们独自生活在孤岛上，我们的行为就不会影响到他人，那么就不需要有约定或规则。但是神造我们处于社会当中，这也就意味着社会要正常有序运转就需要有一定秩序。

Right away in the opening words of Genesis 2, we hear that God has created man as a social being. “It is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). God told Adam and Eve to “Fill the earth” (Genesis 1:28); and when after the great flood men refused to comply with this command of God, he confounded their language and “scattered them from there over all the earth” (Genesis 11:8). As St. Paul told the Greek philosophers on Areopagus, “From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live” (Acts 17:26). Therefore, God himself divided the people of the earth into different races, tribes, and nationalities.

在创世纪开篇第二章我们看到神造人是要人群居的。“那人独居不好”（创世纪2:18）。神告诉亚当和夏娃“遍满地面”（创世纪1:28）；但是洪水之后人没有遵守神的命令，所以神就变乱他们的言语“使众人分散在全地上”（创世纪11:8）。圣保罗在亚略巴古中告诉希腊的学士说，“他从一本造出万族的人，（本有古卷作血脉），住在全地上，并且豫先定准他们的年限，和所住的疆界”（使徒行传17:26）。因此神亲自把地上众人分成不同的种族、部落和民族。

#### Civil Ordinances 民法条例

In the very distant past…many, many years ago, we might say that God let each group of people to work out their own regulations and governments. For in Acts 14:16, Scripture states, “In the past…[God] let all nations go their own way.” But this was a part of his righteous judgment “So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices” (Psalm 81:12). Paul calls these “the times of this ignorance” (Acts 17:30 KJV), where men “although they claimed to be wise…became fools” (Romans 1:22). The fact that God left it to men, within certain limits, might explain the vast differences that exist between one government and the next.

在很久很久以前，我们可以说神让每个群体制定自己的规则决定自己的管理方式。因为在使徒行传14:16，圣经说道，“他在从前的世代，任凭万国各行其道。” 但这是神公义审判的一部分“我便任凭他们心里刚硬，随自己的计谋而行”（诗篇81:12）。保罗称之为“蒙昧无知的时候”（使徒行传17:30），人“自称为聪明，反成了愚拙”（罗马书1:22）。因为神给人有一定的自由空间，这也是为什么政府与政府之间各不相同。

Yet, even in these circumstances where God allowed governance to form itself from one nation to another, it is also true, that God “Has not left himself without testimony” according to Acts 14:17. It remained true that in him (God), people lived and moved and had their being (Acts 17:28). Therefore, whatever is good in the regulations of civil affairs by men is due entirely to God. And there are several factors that we must point to in order for us to make this connection.

尽管神允许国家各自决定自己的管理方式，但是在使徒行传14:17神“为自己未尝不显出证据来”。同样我们生活、动作和存留都在乎他（神）（使徒行传17:28），这是真实的。所以民事条例中好的东西全在乎与神。我们需要了解几点才能把二者联系起来。

1) All men know that there is a God

1）世人皆知有一位神

Romans 1:19 “What may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.”

罗马书 1:19神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里。因为神已经给他们显明。

History bears this first point out. No people, no matter on how low a level of civilization they might be, has yet been found which did not acknowledge the existence of, and their dependence on, some superior being.

历史给我们点明了第一点。不管文明程度如何，从来没有那个民族不承认或仰赖超自然东西的存在。

![](/images/note/ags/22-1.jpg#center)

2) The inscribed Law written on our hearts

2）刻在人心版上的律。

Consider this: There was approximately three thousand years of history in this world before God gave his people Israel the moral Law known as the Ten Commandments. Yet, there was still a law in the world, the one God inscribed on every human heart. All civilizations, for instance, knew that human life was valuable and sacred. Therefore, even though they didn’t believe in the true God in many instances, they still embodied God’s law as they governed each other and protected their people.

考虑下面事实：在神赐给以色列十诫之律之前人类已有大约三千年的历史。但当时世上已有律法，也就是神刻在人心版上的律法。比如说，所有的文明都认同人的生命尊贵而神圣。因此尽管很多时候人不相信真神，但他们统治和保护自己的人民的时候他们还是表现出了神的律法。

3) Conscience. Conscience differs from the inscribed law written on our hearts in that it operates with that natural law from God. When we transgress the inscribed law of God, all humanity experiences the feeling we call guilt. When we do right in our own eyes and in the eyes of him who inscribed the law on our hearts, for instance, protect our neighbor and defend him, our conscience approves of such behavior and is often acknowledged by nearly every government as behavior worthy of an award or medal.

3）良心。良心不同于刻在我们心版上的律因为良心是同神的自然之律一致的。当我们违背神所刻的律的时候，我们所有的感受叫内疚。当我们行在那位刻律法在我们心里眼中所看为对的事情的时候，比如保护我们的邻居，我们的良心会赞同此举，几乎所有的政府也认为这是应该奖励提倡的。

Romans 2:14-16 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) 16 This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.

罗马书 2 :14-16 没有律法的外邦人，若顺着本性行律法上的事，他们虽然没有律法，自己就是自己的律法。15这是显出律法的功用刻在他们心里，他们是非之心同作见证，并且他们的思念互相较量，或以为是，或以为非。16就在神藉耶稣基督审判人隐秘事的日子，照着我的福音所言。

• Therefore, when men regulate civil affairs, they have their conscience to guide them and to forewarn them on the basis of the inscribed law, reminding them of the impending judgment before the throne of God himself.

因此当人管理民事事务的时候，良心会依据刻在心版上的律法来引导人，时刻提醒人将来在主宝座前将要面临的审判。

4) A fourth factor must be considered when dealing with the topic “Civil Affairs” and that is, Natural Reason.

4）当提到“民事”这个题目的时候我们不得不考虑第四点，就是天生理智。

In spiritual matters, natural reason plays no part in conversion as we know that the Holy Spirit works exclusively through the powerful means of grace – the gospel in Word and Sacrament. However, in civil affairs, because man has an inscribed law on his heart, a conscience and a basic knowledge that a superior power exists that they are accountable to, natural reason plays a part in government policies. That’s why our article states: “That man’s will has some liberty to choose civil righteousness, and to work things subject to reason.”

在属灵的事上天生理智在我们的转变上不起作用因为我们知道这完全是圣灵藉着恩典的途径—福音和圣礼—所做的工。但是在民事上，因为人有刻在心里的律，有良心又知道有超自然能力的存在人需要对之负责，这样天生理智就在政府政策上起一定作用。这也是我们本篇为什么说“在民事中人的意志有自由选择正义的事，使凡事都在人的理智之下。”

#### Civil Government is a creation of God 政府是神所设立的

![](/images/note/ags/22-2.jpg#right)

We saw earlier in this study how God has implanted himself in man’s hearts as he has inscribed his law and given them a conscience as a witness, and he endowed them with reason and the ability to discern between what is beneficial and what is harmful. In this way he equipped them to organize governments which he can use as his implements in carrying out his world providence.

在之前的学习中我们看到神是如何把他自己放在我们心中的，他将律法刻在我们心版上又赐给我们良心作为证据，他又赐给我们理智和分辨是非善恶的能力。他这样装备人好使人可以去建立政府，神要藉着政府将自己的意思向世界显明。

The apostle Paul wrote at great length regarding the divine origin of government and before we take a look at Paul’s words, let us remember the time period from which he is writing the letter. It was the time period of the Roman emperor, the man who headed the whole Roman government, the cruel and vicious Emperor Nero, persecutor of Christians, the man responsible for beheading Paul, and burning down Rome and bringing it to ruins.

关于政府来自于神使徒保罗写了很多，在我们看之前让我们首先了解一下他写这封信的时代背景。当时是罗马帝国暴君尼禄做一国之君，他迫害基督徒也是将保罗斩首的人，他一把大火将罗马化为灰烬。

Submit to the Governing Authorities
Romans 13:1-7 1) Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2) Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3) For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4) For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5) Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6) This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7) Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

顺从执政掌权者

罗马书 13:1-7 在上有权柄的，人人当顺服他。因为没有权柄不是出于神的。凡掌权的都是神所命的。2所以抗拒掌权的，就是抗拒神的命；抗拒的必自取刑罚。 3作官的原不是叫行善的惧怕，乃是叫作恶的惧怕。你愿意不惧怕掌权的么？你只要行善，就可得他的称赞，4因为他是神的用人，是与你有益的。你若作恶，却当惧怕。因为他不是空空的佩剑。他是神的用人，是伸冤的，刑罚那作恶的。5所以你们必须顺服，不但是因为刑罚，也是因为良心。6你们纳粮，也为这缘故。因他们是神的差役，常常特管这事。7凡人所当得的，就给他。当得粮的，给他纳粮。当得税的，给他上税。当惧怕的，惧怕他。当恭敬的，恭敬他。

vv. 1-2 What is God’s command?

神的命令是什么？

God’s command is that we submit ourselves to the governing authorities

神要我们顺服执政掌权的

Why does he give that command (mentioned three times!)?

为什么神要这样命令我们？

Because they are God’s servants to do us good and not harm

因为他们是神的用人，是与我们有益的

What happens to those who rebel against that command?

抗拒掌权的有什么后果呢？

They rebel against God’s servant and therefore are subject to not only the governments

是抗拒神的仆人，就会受到政府以外的挟制

Who was the “governing authority” in Rome at that time?

当时罗马的“执政掌权者”是谁？

Emperor Nero, who was known for his ruthless behavior against Christians

尼禄皇帝，以残忍迫害基督徒著称

vv. 3-4 Who needs to be afraid of the governing authorities?

谁应该害怕执政掌权的？

Those who do wrong (violate their natural knowledge of God; violate the inscribed law on their hearts; violate their conscience; violate the natural reason that God gave to them)

犯罪的（明知得罪神故意去做；违背神所刻在心版上的律；违背良心；违背神所赐的理智）

In what two ways does Paul describe the value of God’s governing authorities?

保罗从哪两个方面来讲神的执政掌权者得价值？

1) He is God’s--------- to do you------- .

1） 他是神的---------是与你-------.

2) He is --------an -------of------- to bring------- on the--------.

2） 他是--------- 的 ------------ 为要 -----------那-------。

Governing authority “bears the sword.” What does this mean?

执政掌权的是“佩剑”的。这意味着什么？

The sword is an instrument used for judgment, meaning this: if the government chooses to use the death penalty for those who violate the law of the land, they have been given that authority to carry out capital punishment.

剑是审判所用，意味着：如果政府要给犯法的人死刑，他们有这样做的权力。

v. 5 What is the main reason why Christians will submit to the governing authorities?

基督徒要顺服执政掌权的主要原因是什么？

Because the authority was instituted by God.

因为他们是神所命的。

v. 6-7 What is the connection between paying taxes, on the one hand, and paying respect and honoring authorities, on the other?

一方面要纳税另一方面要惧怕恭敬，二者有何联系？

If on the one hand we pay taxes to the government but then turn around and talk bad about them to others, then we’re not giving them the respect that God requires us to give them. Every civil government is going to have its fair share of problems because this world is filled with sinners. However, it’s important that we understand that the government’s main function is to provide us with peace and civility. We can look at some 3rd world countries that are governed by

如果我们一方面纳税给政府但却转身跟别人去说政府的坏话，那么我们就没有安神的要求去恭敬政府。每一个政府都有问题因为整个世界满了罪人。但是重要的是我们要知道政府主要作用是给我们营造一个安定文明的环境。我们可以看一下一些第三世界国家

For Further Thought and Discussion:

进一步思考和讨论：

In the course of history, church/state relationships have taken several forms:

在历史的进程中，政教关系有以下几种形式：

• the state controls the church – Example? Constantine, and time period of the crusades, and much of post Reformation Europe

国家控制宗教—例如？ 康斯坦丁，十字军时期，和很多改教后的欧洲国家

• the church controls the state – Example? Roman Catholic church during the middle ages; the Holy Roman Empire was heavily influenced by the church

教会控制国家—例如？ 中世纪罗马天主教；圣罗马帝国深受教会影响。

• church and state recognize and encourage each other’s distinct God-given responsibilities

教会和国家相互认可对方的神所赐的不同责任。

Which of these three fit in best with what Paul says in Romans 13?

这三个哪个更符合保罗在罗马书13章所说的？

The third option seems to be the best for peace and prosperity for the church

第三个最有益于教会稳定和发展

1. Agree or Disagree? The Bible teaches that there should be complete separation of church and state.

    同意或不同意？圣经教导我们政教应该完全分离。

    Not necessarily. There are issues that the state is concerned about that the church is deeply concerned about as well. Examples would be marriage. The state and church cooperate in this regard. The state has an economic concern since taxes change when men and women marry; the church has a concern because marriage was instituted by God. Also, human life issues, would be another area where state and church might mix a bit. Abortion of an unborn child is legalized in the U.S. in spite of the fact that over 50% of the people in this country believe that when a mother aborts her child it is murder. The church’s voice must continue to be heard for the protection of the unborn babies, which means we must work together to try and change these laws. Jesus called us “Salt of the earth,” and if we cease to be salt or a moral voice in this world, Jesus says we cease to be his followers. So it’s hard for the church and state to remain completely separate when issues pertain to both parties.

    不完全对。国家和教会有共同关心的问题。比如婚姻。在这个问题上政教应该联合。国家关心是经济方面的因为当人们结婚后纳税会有变化；教会关心是因为婚姻是神所设立的。还有民生问题，这是另外一个政教都关系的问题。尽管多于50%的民众认为堕胎是谋杀但堕胎在美国已经合法化。政府应该不断听教会的声音来保护未出生的婴孩，也就是说我们应该一道来尽力改变这些法律。耶稣称我们为“世上的盐”，如果我们不再做盐做道德的声音，在耶稣眼里我们就不再是他的门徒了。所有当有共同问题出现的时候就很难再政教完全分离了。

2. What “tools” has God put into the hands of the church? Word and sacrament

    神给教会什么“工具” 道和圣礼

    of the state? Enforcement of laws of the land (they don’t bear the sword for nothing)

    给国家呢？ 执行国家的法律（佩剑不是徒然）

3. Agree or Disagree? Those who serve the state as legislators, governors, police, etc., are just as much “ministers of God” as those who serve as pastors, evangelists, etc.

    同意或不同意？在政府做立法者、官员、警察等等的，跟牧师传道人等一样是神的“使者”。

    The answer is true, especially when we consider the word minister simply means “servant.” Pastors and evangelists play a bigger role in carrying the message of salvation to others in this world, but both are servants of God given different tools with which we serve our God. The state is given natural reason, conscience, inscribed law, and their natural knowledge of God. The pastor is given Word and sacraments as his tools.

    正确，尤其是当我们考虑到使者一词意为“仆人”。在传讲救恩给世人听方面牧师和传道人扮演更重要角色，但是他们都是用不同工具服侍神的仆人。国家也有神所赐的理智、良心和刻在心版上的律法，国家也认识神。神赐给牧师道和圣礼做工具。

4. What kind of allegiance did the Germans owe to Hitler? The Russians to Stalin? The colonists to King George of England?

    德国是如何拥护希特勒的？俄国是如何拥护斯大林的？殖民地的人是如何拥护英国乔治国王的？

    It’s important that we don’t just say when it’s o.k. to disobey a government and say it’s o.k. when we should obey a government because it’s hard to look from the outside in and determine when we’re being asked to sin against our conscience by following our government leader. I believe in the case of Hitler and others like him, its easy for us to look back into history and see here was a man who was clearly asking many of his own countrymen to sin by giving him their allegience. But not every case is so easy to determine. Remember, Paul writes about submission to the governing authorities during a time-period of unprecedented persecution of Christians.

    很重要的是当我们不应该顺服政府的时候去顺服政府。有时候我们顺服政府是因为从外面很难判断顺服政府是不是在犯罪违背我们的良心。我相信在希特勒和其它相同的例子里，我们现在回顾历史可以很容易的判定他要国民所做的忠于他的是犯罪的事情。但是不是说所有的时候都这么容易区分。要知道，保罗是在空前迫害基督徒的时代里写要顺服执政掌权者的。

5. The 4th Commandment is placed right after the commandments dealing with what we owe God. Why?

    第四条诫命紧跟在与我们应该如何对待神诫命之后，为什么？

    Could it be because God wants order to remain with society?

    可能是神要我们遵守社会的规则？

6. What is the only God-pleasing reason for not obeying a government?

    不遵守政府唯一的可以让神喜悦的理由是什么？

    The only God-pleasing reason for disobedience to the government is if they make us sin against God by either bowing to a false god or do something sinful against God’s Law.

    唯一让神喜悦的不遵守政府的原因是如果他们要我们拜假神或违背神的律法犯罪得罪神。

7. Agree or Disagree? According to Romans 13, all murderers should be executed.

    同意或不同意？根据罗马书13章，所有的谋杀者应该处决。

    Disagree: It’s up to the government and therefore Christians aren’t concerned about whether the person is executed or not. There may be instances where the government decides not to terminate someone’s life and if that’s the verdict they render to

    不同意：这是政府的职责，因此基督徒不应该过问这个人有没有处决。因为有可能政府决定不结束一个人的生命。

8. Why is it not a sin to take a life in war?

    为什么战争中杀人不是犯罪？

    Assuming that this is not a war done in the name of Adolph Hitler’s cause, which was clearly unjustified, and assuming that the war was instigated by another nation and the protection of your own people are what’s at stake, then it is not a sin to take the life of another person on behalf of your country because the government is God’s servant and we are serving God when we are serving government.

    假设这不是以阿道夫希特勒名义发起的不义之战，假设这场战争是由别国挑起的保护你的国民就义不容辞，那么以自己的国家的名义去杀人就不是犯罪，因为政府是神的仆人而你是在服侍你的政府。

9. Agree or Disagree? “Conscientious objection” to be in the military is a sin against
Romans 13.

    同意或不同意？“凭良心拒绝”服兵役是犯罪违反罗马书13.

    If a person objects to military conflict it may be justified if the war is unjust. However, the objector of the military might have to suffer the consequences for objecting by possibly suffering jail time

    如果一个人拒绝为不义之战服兵役那他就是正义的。然而拒绝者可能要承受拒绝的结果可能是坐牢。

10. Agree or Disagree? Anarchy (no government) is better than a corrupt government.

    同意或不同意？无政府主义比腐败政府更好。

No. We can see plenty of examples in our world where tribal rulers continuously shed the blood of others because there was no government control over bad behavior.

不是。我们可以看到世界上很多的例子部落首领任意杀戮因为没有政府来管制这种恶行。

Peter adds a thought to Paul’s words, reminding us that the outward form of the government, whether it is a democracy, a communist regime, or dictatorship is really of little consequence to the Christian. Peter writes…

彼得在保罗的话上又有补充，提醒我们不论政府采取什么形式，民主制也好，共产主义也好或独裁制也好，这对基督徒几乎没有影响。彼得写道…

1 Peter 2:13,14 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

彼得前书 2: 13-14 你们为主的缘故，要顺服人的一切制度，或是在上的君王，14或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。

The function of Government, then, is to maintain order and civility in society. The purpose of the Bible is NOT to tell governments how to conduct their affairs. The Bible was given to proclaim God’s saving love to sinners, to lead them to faith in their Savior, and to produce in them the fruits of sanctification.

政府的职能是维护社会安定文明。圣经的目的不是要指导政府如何管理国家。圣经是为要给罪人传神的救赎大爱，让罪人相信救主并结出称义的果实来。

The government holds power over its citizens in three areas:

政府通过三种方式来统治国民：


![](/images/note/ags/22-3.jpg#right)

1) Monetary means

1）货币方式

“And he [Jesus] asked them, ‘Whose image is this? And whose inscription?’  21 ‘Caesar’s,’ they replied.  Then he said to them, ‘So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s’” (Matthew 22:20,21).

马太福音 22：20，21 耶稣说，这像和这号是谁的。21他们说，是该撒的。耶稣说，这样，该撒的物当归给该撒，神的物当归给神。

2) Government’s power over the earthly life of an individual

2) 政府统治人的生命

![](/images/note/ags/22-4.jpg#right)

“Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” (Genesis 9:6). This was God’s decree for mankind right after the judgment of the flood. And it’s reiterated by Paul in Romans 13 as Paul says that the government “does not bear the sword for nothing” (13:4).

“凡流人血的，他的血也必被人所流”（创世纪9:6）。这是神在大洪水之后给人的命令。保罗在罗马书13章又重述他说政府“不是空空的佩剑”（13:4）。

3) Marriage

3）婚姻

![](/images/note/ags/22-5.jpg#right)

Here, as in other areas of governance, the people are often confronted with the necessity of choosing between two evils. God’s will concerning marriage is clearly stated in the creation of Eve: the two, a man and his wife, shall be one flesh. But sinful man persists in separating what God has joined together. Such is the hardness of sinful hearts. If this were not regulated in some form or fashion by local governments, then you would have a society that would have a free for all like we see in some parts of Africa and other third world countries where man has asserted his strength over the woman and in some cases jumps from hut to hut having his way with any woman he chooses. God’s judgment upon such activity has clearly been seen through a whole host of diseases that are contracted by such behavior. The government’s responsibility, in some way, is to keep order in the home. Even Moses under the guidance of God gave some regulations concerning divorce, not in agreement with God’s original institution. These regulations given by Moses were a concession due to the hardness of man’s heart and for the aim of keeping some sort of civility amongst the people.

跟政治的其它方面一样，在这里人们也经常面临两种邪恶。在创造夏娃的时候神对婚姻的旨意已经清楚的显明了：丈夫和妻子二人要成为一体。但是罪人总是要拆散神所结合的。这就是罪人之心的刚硬。如果政府在这方面不加以一定方式的管制，那么社会上人人都没有约束，就会像我们在非洲或一些第三世界国家所看到的那样，男人对女人有绝对的权利或有时候男人随意流窜到茅舍中任意占用女人。从这些行为所经常引起的一系列疾病可以清楚的看出神对这种行为的审判。政府的职责在某种意义上说就是要维持家庭的秩序。摩西也依据神的启示给离婚予以规定，跟神最初的设立有所不同。摩西的这些规定考虑到了人心的刚硬而有一定的变通，为了在人们中间维持一定的文明。

#### May Christians serve in Governments 基督徒可以在政府任职

Our article of faith clearly states that “It is right for Christians to bear civil office.” But then it sort of categorizes such civil offices within government by making three different groups. The first group consists of the following three: to sit as judges, to judge matters by the Imperial and other existing laws, to ward just punishments.

我们的信心之篇清楚的说道“基督徒可以在政府中任职”。然后它又分三类列举了政府中的这些职责。第一类包括以下三个：做审判官，根据国家和其它法律断事，惩善罚恶。

In regulating his personal affairs, a Christian will be guided by no other standard than the law of God. Jesus summed up the law of God with two expressions: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind” and “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Any deviation from these two principals is a sin.

在管理自己的事情方面，基督徒单单靠神的律法的指引。耶稣把神的律法归纳为两条：尽心、尽意、尽力爱主你的神和爱人如己。偏离这两个原则的就是罪。

When it comes to ruling for the court, in the land, separating love for neighbor and God, and love for country might not always be that easy to do so each individual case must be examined by that person’s love for God and neighbor. Now, if love for God and neighbor is not an issue in the judge’s ruling, there may be flexibility to his decision. Government was NOT created by God to judge in spiritual matters, such as church discipline if a person is not attending church. That judgment, God entrusted to the church, not the state. Government was instituted by God for the purpose of keeping its people safe and civil amongst each other.

至于在司法行政方面，爱又分爱人和爱神，还有爱国，做到这些就没有那么容易，事事既要考虑爱人又要考虑爱神。如果审判者判定不需要考虑既爱人又爱神，那么他做决定就有更大的灵活性。神设立政府不是要处理属灵的事情，比如教会处理一个人没有参加聚会的问题。这样的事神托付给了教会而不是国家。

Therefore, a judge must render his decisions in accordance with the state’s decree, which may not necessarily coincide with God’s moral law. Let’s look at an example of this…

因此，审判者必须在法律的范围内来判定，而法律不一定完全符合神的道德律法。我们来看个例子…

In our country, the law of our land protects doctors who murder a mother’s baby during the pregnancy. This is called an abortion. In the Christian’s eyes and more importantly in God’s eyes, this is clearly murder. But the law of the land has accepted this has humane behavior and therefore protects such sinful people under its law. For a Christian judge to rule against a doctor for killing babies and sentencing that doctor to life in prison, he would be violating the law of the land and acting unjustly according to the law of the land and be in violation of God’s command where he tells Christians to submit to the governing authorities. However, that judge, in his private ministry as a Christian ought to discourage his government from such laws that go against natural reason, the inscribed law of God on our hearts, and the conscience.

在我们国家医生谋杀在母腹中的婴孩是受法律保护的。这就是流产。在基督徒眼里更重要的是在神眼里，很显然这是谋杀。但是法律认为这是人道的因此保护这些犯罪的人。如果一个基督徒法官判谋杀婴儿的医生无期徒刑的话，根据法律他所做的就是违法的不正义的，而这也违背了神的要顺服执政掌权者得命令。然而，这个法官作为一个基督徒应该劝阻政府制定违背天然理智、神刻在我们心版上的律法和良心的法律。

Let’s consider another example:
According to God’s law, a divorce in a household marriage takes place when one spouse abandons the other spouse, or when there is marital unfaithfulness that occurs. However, the law of the land does not recognize these two incidents to be a necessary cause for divorce. In fact, in our country, and in most states, both a husband and wife have to sign for the divorce after one party files and that divorce is not recognized until the state stamps it DIVORCED. In spite of the fact that God and the church recognized the divorce many, many months maybe even years ago, the state is the one who has the authority to determine the exact time the divorce is put into effect.

让我们来看一下另外一个例子：

根据神的律法，只有当婚姻中一方抛弃另一方时或有婚外情发生是才能离婚。但是国家法律却不认可只有这两种情况发生才能离婚。事实上在我国和其它大多数国家里一方提出离婚后双方都需要离婚协议上签字，但是真正离婚只有等到国家盖章后才被认可。尽管神和教会可能好多月前甚至几年前就已经认可离婚了但是唯有国家有权力决定离婚生效的具体时间。

So then, what is a Christian judge to do, when a husband and wife come before his court and seek a divorce, that God doesn’t grant us in his Word? Let’s say for instance, the wife says, “I’m just tired of taking care of my husband and always picking up after him…” and the husband says, “I’ve just fallen out of love with my wife and I’d like to have a different one.” The judge can’t apply biblical principles of divorce to them saying, “No, because there was no desertion and no unfaithfulness.” He must rule according to the law of the land because God has entrusted them with such authority to grant divorce to any who seek it, but also to provide restitution for one party or the other so that fairness might exist.

那么如果一个基督徒法官碰到丈夫和妻子来法庭离婚应该怎么做呢，神在这方面并没有给予明确教导。假如说，妻子这样说“我已经厌倦照顾我丈夫和不停的在他屁股后面收拾整理…” 而丈夫这样说“我也喜欢不起来我的妻子了我想再换一个。”法官不能应用圣经原则说“不行，因为既没有抛弃也没有婚外情。”他必须依照神所托付他们遵守的国家法律给想离婚的人准予离婚，并且公平起见还要给一方或另一方以赔偿。

Now, let’s take this example a step further. Let’s say that the judge and the married couple he just granted a divorce to, also went to his church each Sunday. Well, it may just happen that the judge granted them their divorce in the courts, but then on Sunday morning, he had to turn to them and admonish them for their sinful behavior because they sought a divorce for causes that God does not permit to us in his Word. And if repentance does still not occur, that judge, with other Christians in the assembly, might have to participate in what the church call an excommunication.

现在让我们来进一步扩展一下这个例子。假设法官跟他准予离婚的夫妇每周日去同一所教堂。可能法官虽然在法庭上准予他们离婚了，但是周日上午的时候他又找到他们并且告诫他们的离婚是一种罪行因为离婚的原因不是神所许可的。如果他们拒不悔改那法官跟教会其它基督徒一起便可以把他们驱逐出会。

This may seem sort of paradoxical or inconsistent to us at first, but the judge was subject to the law of the land and in his submission to them, he ruled fairly…but as a Christian, he also submitted to God in carrying out church discipline upon the impenitent couple for an unlawful divorce in God’s eyes.

咋一看这或许有些矛盾或前后不一，但是法官是依法行事，依照法律他是公正的…但是作为一个基督徒他也要遵守神的命令按教会纪律来处置神所看为不合法离婚的不知悔改的夫妇。

This same thing can be said if a Christian judge condemns a criminal to death. He is not guilty of murder, but is ruling under the authority of the government and submitting to them.

基督徒判罪犯死刑也是同样的道理。他不是犯谋杀而是顺服执政掌权者按规定办事。

This leads us to another important point of our article of faith where it says, “It is right for Christians to engage in just wars, to serve as soldiers.” We all know what a gruesome thing that war is. We read about its horrors every day.

这又引出本篇的另一个重点也就是“基督徒可以参与正义战争，去服兵役。”战争的残酷性尽人皆知。我们每天都了解到战争的可怕性。

For centuries, there have always been Christians who have maintained that fighting in a war and being a Christian are impossible. But our confessions, and most importantly, God’s Word would say otherwise. Martin Luther once wrote a special book on the question if a soldier’s vocation can be God-pleasing and he answered, “Yes,” because we recognize the government as God’s servant, even with all of its various corruptions because of the sinful flesh.

几个世纪以来，基督徒总是认为参与战争和做基督徒是水火不容的事。但是我们的信纲--更重要的是圣经--与之看法不同。马丁路德曾经就神是否会喜悦士兵职业写过一本书，他的答案是肯定的，因为尽管因为人的犯罪的本性政府有很多的腐败，但我们依然承认政府是神的仆人

Luther compares the action of government to that of a medical surgeon who amputates or cuts off a hand or foot. The surgeon doesn’t do this because he merely wants to mutilate his/her patient, he does this in order to save the rest of the body. In the same way, governments who find themselves threatened by others or even attacked go to war as a necessary evil in order to protect and preserve its people and keep them safe.

路德把政府行为比做外科医生截病人的手或脚。医生这样做不是要残害病人而是要保全他身体的剩余部分。同样的，当政府面临危险或攻击时去参加战争是以必要的恶来保护自己国民的平安。

What is a government begins an unjust war? Well, we have God who promises to take out his wrath on such a nation if they do so. Just consider history, for a moment. Those who instigated wars for simply no reason are not around anymore. Perhaps the most famous of the past century would be Joseph Stalin of Russia, and Adolph Hitler of Germany.

如果政府发动不义之战呢？我们知道神必定会把他的怒气加给这样做的国家。我们稍微回顾一下历史。那些无事生非发动战争的人早已灰飞烟灭。上世纪最出名也许就要数俄国的约瑟夫斯大林和德国的阿道夫希特勒了。

It was necessary for our forefathers to write the following:

我们的前辈出于当时需要写下了以下的话：

It is right for a Christian to make legal contracts, to hold property, to make oath when required by the magistrates, to marry a wife, to be given in marriage.

基督徒可以签订合法合同，拥有物权，当执政官要求时可以起誓，可以娶妻和有婚姻生活。

Because the Anabaptists, and others, considered it inconsistent with our Christian faith to practice these things and our Lutheran forefathers felt compelled to separate themselves from such people who advocated anarchy, rather, than peace within each government.

因为再洗礼派和其它一些人认为做这些事是跟基督徒信仰冲突的，我们的路德宗先辈们感到需要从这些主张政治混乱而不愿意与政府和平共处人中分别出来。

There is only one rule that the Christian has when it comes to disobeying its respected leaders and that is this: In Acts 5:29, Peter states, “We must obey God rather than human beings!” But only in matters, that pertain to the government forcing us to sin by bowing to another idol or such matter that infringes upon us from loving God and our neighbor more than ourselves.

当基督徒可以违背掌权者时只有一个原则，这就是：在使徒行传5:29彼得说“顺从神，不顺从人是应当的！”但只有在顺从政府使我们犯罪时—向偶像下拜或违背我们爱神或爱人原则。

Even if a government should go to the extreme of persecuting Christians, this would not be an excuse for us to “resist.” Look at the example of Paul, how fiercely and how unfairly he was persecuted. Felix of Caesarea knew that Paul was innocent; the evidence at the trial had clearly brought out this fact. Yet he did not release him because he was looking for a bribe and because he wanted to maintain favor with the Jews (Acts 24:26,27). Yet Paul, never for that reason, instigated a riot against the government.

即便政府走极端要迫害基督徒，这也不能成为我们“反抗”的理由。让我们看一下保罗的见证，他是受到多么严重和不公平的待遇。凯撒利亚的腓力斯知道保罗无罪；审判时的证据清楚的说明这一点。但是他并没有释放他因为他在等待贿赂和为要讨好犹太人（使徒行传24:26,27）。但是保罗并没有为此去反抗政府。

Or look at Jesus. “When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly” (1 Peter 2:23). And he encourages us to learn from Christ’s “example” and to “follow in his steps” (v. 21).

或者来看一下耶稣的见证。“他被骂不还口。受害不说威吓的话。只将自己交托那按公义审判人的主”（彼得前书2:23）。他还鼓励我们去效法基督的“榜样”和“跟随他的脚踪行”（21节）。

When the enemies of Jesus were about to take him prisoner in the Garden of Gethsemane and when Peter was ready to use his sword, Jesus sternly rebuked him: “Put your sword back in its place…for all who draw the sword will die by the sword” (Matthew 26:52).

当耶稣的敌人在客西马尼园要把他抓起来囚禁的时候和当彼得准备动刀的时候，耶稣对他说：“收刀入鞘吧。因为凡动刀的，必死在刀下”（马太福音26:52）。

Government is an institution of God for our good; and no matter how corrupt a government may be, it is still better than no government at all, far better than anarchy!

神设立政府是为我们的益处；无论政府多么腐败都比没有政府强，更比政治混乱要强得多。
