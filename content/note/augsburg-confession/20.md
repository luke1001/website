#### Of Ecclesiastical Order they teach that no one should publicly teach in the Church or administer the Sacraments unless he be regularly called. 关于教会中的秩序他们教导如果没有按理受召就不应该公开教导和施圣礼。

#### THE PUBLIC MINISTRY 公众事工

To distinguish the way our forefathers have separated public and private ministry consider the following illustration: A Christian travels alone in some obscure country where Jesus is unknown. He wasn’t sent by a group of believers (the church) nor was it official church business that this person was on but rather, a vacation. Being a Christian, he acts like a Christian and also begins to speak about his Savior. This is news to the people. A great crowd gathers around him and listens to him while he is talking to them about their salvation. According to the common use of the word, he would be speaking publicly since he is addressing a great number of people. Yet in the sense of our Article he would be doing it privately because the church did not send him to do this, but rather he is doing it as a private minister of the gospel who has been given the blessed privilege of sharing Christ to the whole world. He was not commissioned by any church, he was not sent by any church, nor did any church expect a report from him. He was traveling on a private vacation, and as a private Christian he confessed his faith as the opportunity presented itself.

要了解我们先辈们是如何区分公众事工和个人事工的请看以下一段引用：一个基督徒单独到某个不认识耶稣的地方去。他没有众信徒（教会）的差派也不是教会的公差，那么这个人就实际是在度假。做为一个基督徒他行自己的本分并传讲他的救主。这对人们是新奇的事。他跟人们讲救恩的事就有很多人来听。就传讲神话语的方式来说他是在对公众传讲因为有很多的听众。但是按照我们本篇意思所说的他这样做是个人性的因为他没有教会的差遣，他所作的个人的福音事工，神也赐给他这样的权利去给世人分享福音。他没有任何教会的委派，也没有任何教会的差遣，更没有教会需要他做报告。他是在自己度假，作为一个基督徒他适时的把握了机会去分享自己的信仰。

But now let us suppose a group of Christians gathered together and asked one of them to say grace before a meal. The man leading in prayer does so publicly because he was appointed by his fellow Christians to act in their name and on their behalf. He represented them. There two or three came together in Jesus’ name, and Jesus was with them.

但是现在让我们假设一群基督徒聚到一起然后请其中一个人做饭前感恩祷告。带领祷告的人所做的就是公众性的因为他是受他一起的基督徒的委托以他们的名义来做的。他代表他们。有两三个人奉主耶稣的名聚集主就与他们同在。

Consider for a moment the following scenarios and let’s try to define them as public ministry or private ministry:

考虑一下情况并分辨它们是公众事工还是个人事工：

1. A group of Christians appoint a man to preach the Word of God, baptize, and commune them.

    一群基督徒委派一个人去传神的话语、施洗和同他们领圣餐。

2. A Christian goes to the local prison to offer spiritual assistance to whoever desires it.

    一名基督徒去当地监狱去给需要的人提供属灵帮助。

3. A hospice worker, hired by the hospital, who prays for their patients in their last moments of life.

    一个被医院雇佣的安养院员工在病人临终时刻为他们祷告。

4. An elder of the church who prays for the lost sheep and seeks after them through visitations

    教会的长老为迷失的羊祷告和通过探访来找回他们。

5. A Sunday school teacher who brings God’s Word to her children each week.

    主日学老师每周给小孩子讲神的话。

6. A minister of music appointed by the church to enhance worship each week.

    教会任命的音乐事工负责人来辅助每周的敬拜。

7. A Christian who goes and witnesses to his neighbors, friends, and family

    一个去给他的邻舍、朋友和家人做神的见证的基督徒。

    • An easy way to keep this terminology straight is this: If work is being done on behalf of fellow Christians, which constitutes the “church” then that ministry is public. Otherwise, all other ministry is private.

    简单明了的概括：如果事工是以众基督徒也就是教会的名义做的就是公众事工。否则就是个人事工。

    **One last identification. 请分辨**
    
    Suppose an elderly woman goes to the hospital. I (her pastor) visit her, her elder visits her, and so do other members of the church, as well as her family. Who is performing public and who is performing private ministry?

    假如一位年长的妇人住院。我（她的牧师）去看望他，她的长老去看望她，教会其他人也去看望她，还有她的家人也去看望她。谁是在做公众事工，谁是在做个人事工？

    • I want you to note the clarity of this article. In the public ministry we are to first “teach” and second “administer the sacraments.” No more and no less! The business of the church is not massive programs, it’s not to be a political voice for its government, it’s not a social gospel (only concerned about the physical changes of peoples and society). Rather, it is the business of the body of believers to call a minister of the gospel to proclaim peace through Jesus Christ and administer the sacraments.

    希望大家能够认识清楚本篇的内容。在公众事工中我们一是“教导”二是“施圣礼”。不能增加，也不能减少！教会不是要大张旗鼓的做工，教会不是政府的政治声音，也不是社会福音（只关注人和社会的外在改变）。教会乃是信徒所组成的来呼召福音的使者传扬主耶稣的平安和施行圣礼的。

8. Can you think of a task that Christ assigned to the church just prior to his ascending into heaven?

    你知道基督在升天前所托付给教会的使命吗？

    Matthew 28:18-20 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

    马太福音28:18-20 耶稣进前来，对他们说，天上，地下所有的权柄，都赐给我了。所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。（或作给他们施洗归于父子圣灵的名）凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。

    We, like the disciples of Jesus, must fight the urge of mixing politics with the work of the church as though it is the church’s business to change government policies. When the disciples still had a skewed view of Christ’s kingdom, they asked him: “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” But he rebuked them sharply saying: “It is not for you to know the times and the dates the Father has set by his own authority” (Acts 1:6,7).

    跟耶稣的门徒一样，我们也要杜绝把教会的工作跟政治搅和到一块，好像教会的工作就是要改变政府的政策。当门徒们对基督的国度还有歪曲的看法时他们问耶稣说，主阿，你复兴以色列国，就在这时候吗。耶稣对他们说，父凭着自己的权柄，所定的时候日期，不是你们可以知道的。 （ 使徒行传1:6,7）

9. Then Jesus summed up the work he expected his disciples to perform in one word. Can you remember?

    然后主耶稣用一句话总结了他期待门徒们所做的，你记得是什么吗？

    Acts 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

    使徒行传1:8 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力。并要在耶路撒冷，犹太全地，和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。

    We are witnesses! No more. No less.

    我们要做见证人！不能增加。也不能减少。

    When Jesus fed the 5,000, consider what the people tried to do with Jesus and then consider the reaction of Jesus.

    当耶稣喂饱5000人时，考虑当时人们要跟耶稣做什么和耶稣的反应。

    John 6:15 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.

    约翰福音6:15 耶稣既知道众人要来强逼他作王，就独自又退到山上去了。

10. When someone asked Jesus to help him settle his estate with his brother, how did Jesus handle that situation?

    当有人要耶稣来帮他分开他跟他的兄弟的家业的时候，耶稣是如何处理的？

    Luke 12:14 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?”

    路加福音12:14 耶稣说，你这个人，谁立我作你们断事的官，给你们分家业呢。

    ![](/images/note/ags/20-3.jpg#right)
    
11. After Jesus testified to Pilate that he was a king, he then went on to tell Pilate for what reason he was born. What was the reason?

    当耶稣见证给彼拉多他是王之后又告诉彼拉多他降世的原因。原因是什么？

John 18:36-37 Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.” 37 “You are a king, then!” said Pilate.   Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.

约翰福音 18:36-37 耶稣回答说，我的国不属这世界。我的国若属这世界，我的臣仆必要争战，使我不至于被交给犹太人。只是我的国不属这世界。彼拉多就对他说，这样，你是王麽。耶稣回答说，你说我是王。我为此而生，也为此来到世间，特为给真理作见证。凡属真理的人，就听我的话。

So it is, then, that the main function of the church still remains the same - to teach and to administer the sacraments. And what a blessed task this is! There is no greater task in the world. According to Matthew 16:19, we often call this high office of ministry, the ministry of the keys because Jesus, in speaking of it, said to Peter: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.”

所以，教会的主要作用还是一如既往--教导和施行圣礼。这是多么蒙福的使命！世上没有再比这更大的使命了。在马太福音16：19，我们通常称之为特级事工也就是钥匙的事工，因为耶稣这样对彼得说：“我要把天国的钥匙给你”。

The powers of this world offer temporal things; the power of the gospel and its ministry of proclaiming forgiveness to the penitent and refusing forgiveness to the impenitent offers eternal things. Since this is the commission of the church, to teach and to administer the Sacraments, the church holds the highest, the most beneficial office on earth. Sadly, many in the church don’t realize the importance of this office until they are knocking on the door of death.


世界的能力是暂时的；福音的大能和传悔改的得赦、不悔改的定罪的福音事工是永远的。因为教导和施圣礼是教会的大使命，教会有地上最高和最蒙福的职分。可悲的是，很多教会中的人直到垂死才认识到这种职分的重要性。

 ![](/images/note/ags/20-4.jpg#right)

Consider the reaction of heaven’s angels when God’s servants lead people to repentance of their sins and a trust in the mercy and love of God in Jesus through the story that Jesus tells – the Prodigal son. The father of the prodigal son rebuked his elder son when he refused to rejoice at his brother’s return:


想一下在耶稣所讲的浪子的故事中当神的仆人带领人悔改相信神通过耶稣所赐的怜悯和爱的时候的反应。当浪子的哥哥拒绝为他的弟弟的回头庆祝的时候他的父亲责备他说：

“But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found” (Luke 15:32). This parable was told by Jesus to illustrate what he had said a little while before: “In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents” (verse 10).

只是你这个兄弟是死而复活，失而又得的，所以我们理当欢喜快乐。（路加福音15:32）耶稣讲这个比喻是为了阐明他之前所说的：我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在神的使者面前，也是这样为他欢喜。（10节）

#### WHO AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH ARE TO DO THIS GREAT WORK? 教会中谁要做这伟大的工作呢？

John reminds us that this commission was given to all believers. Read the following…

约翰提醒我们这大使命是给所有信徒的。请读以下…

Revelation 1:5-6 Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.  To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, 6 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.

 ![](/images/note/ags/20-5.jpg#right)

启示录 1:5-6 并那诚实作见证的，从死里首先复活，为世上君王元首的耶稣基督。有恩惠平安归与你们。他爱我们，用自己的血使我们脱离罪恶。又使我们成为国民，作他父神的祭司。但愿荣耀权能归给他，直到永永远远。阿们。

In the vision John receives in chapter 5 of Revelation, the four living creatures and the 24 elders sing a new song to the Lamb, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth” (vs. 9-10)

在启示录第五章约翰看到的异象中，四活物跟24长老为羔羊唱新歌：你配拿书卷，配揭开七印。因为你曾被杀，用自己的血从各族各方，各民各国中买了人来，叫他们归于神，又叫他们成为国民，作祭司，归于神。在地上执掌王权。

This we call the Universal Priesthood of all believers. Consider Peter’s words in his letter…

我们称之为信徒皆祭司。思考彼得在他的心中所说的…


Peter 2:9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

彼得前书 2:9 惟有你们是被拣选的族类，是有君尊的祭司，是圣洁的国度，是属神的子民，要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗入奇妙光明者的美德。

This exalted position, which comes from Christ himself, might not mean much according to the standards of the world, but every Christian must be overwhelmed in his heart by the high honor conferred on him. For we are all authorized by Jesus to tell the good news of the gospel to the people of this world!

这个来自基督的君尊的职位在世界来看没什么了不起，但是每一位基督徒都应该为所授予的这项荣誉欢喜快乐。因为我们被神差遣来向世人传讲福音！

Every Christian is authorized to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; that is, he is empowered and equipped to effect a rebirth, to raise a man who is dead in trespasses and sins to new spiritual and heavenly life in faith. And yet not even the most skillful physician can approach this achievement.

每一位基督徒都有神所赐的奉圣父、圣子和圣灵之名施洗的权柄，也就是他被赐予使生命重生和使在罪中死去的人靠信重新获得属灵属天生命的权柄。即便是最高明的医生也做不成这事。

Consider this account in the Corinthian church:

思考发生在哥林多教会这件事：

There was a man in Corinth who by his adulterous living had disgraced the gospel and the name of his Savior. The Corinthians congregation did nothing about it for a while. Then Paul severely called them to task for their neglect: “Your boasting is not good...Expel the wicked man from among you” (I Corinthians 5:6,13). As Christ’s appointed kings and priests, it was within their control to do so. Later, when the adulterer repented, Paul again advised them, saying, “Now instead, you ought to forgive him and comfort him...I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him” (2 Cor. 2:7,8).

在哥林多教会有个人因为淫乱的生活羞辱了福音和救主之名。哥林多会众长时间没有处理这件事情。然后保罗严格的教训他们要弥补自己的疏忽：你们这自夸是不好的…你们应当把那恶人从你们中间赶出去。（哥林多前书5:6,13）作为基督的君王和祭司，如此做是分内的事。后来，当犯淫乱的人悔改的时候，保罗再次建议他们，说：倒不如赦免他，安慰他…所以我劝你们，要向他显出坚定不移的爱心来.（林后2:7,8）

What Paul wrote to the Corinthian church was merely an application in a special case of the general rule Jesus gave his disciples. When Jesus gave to Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven, he did not mean that Peter should wear them as a badge for decorative purposes. He gave his apostles the keys for actual use. He showed them how to apply the keys in Matthew 18 when he said, “If he refuses to lisen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector,” whereas to the contrary of that if he listens to you, Jesus said, “You have won your brother over” (v. 15).

保罗所写给哥林多教会的只不过是耶稣教导他门徒的通用原则在个例上的应用。当耶稣把天国的钥匙赐给彼得时，他不是要彼得挂在身上做装饰而是要去用这些钥匙。在马太福音18章神告诉他们如何使用这些钥匙：若是不听教会，就看他像外邦人和税吏一样。但是相反如果他听了你，耶稣说：你便得了你的弟兄。（15节）。

If, then, there is no difference between me and you or any other Christian because we are all priests before God and we all reign with Christ as kings, why do we have differences between the roles of men and women laid out for us in the Bible? For instance, why does the Bible attribute elders of the church and pastors to be male, rather than female?

如果你我和其他任何一个基督徒之间没有区别因为我们都是祭司并且要和基督一同做王，那为什么圣经中男女分工会不同？比如，为什么圣经要教会长老和牧师都是男性而不是女性？

Just remember, whenever the Christian is alone, the matter is simple. But when two or three come together (or more) other factors play in because of the roles God has instituted for his body of believers. Think of the church as an extension of the family that God created. In the family, God ordained man to be the leader of his household and in the church, where two or three come together, God expects men to lead in this area as well.

要知道只有一个基督徒时，事情是很简单的。但是当两三个人到一块（或更多）时就要考虑其他的因素，因为神给他身体上不同肢体有不同的角色。可以把教会看成是神所设立的家庭的延伸。在这个大家庭里，神立男人作为教会一家之长，当两三个人到一起时，神也要男人担起这种责任。

Let us not forget that Matthew 28:18 known as the Great Commission to the church to “Go and make disciples” was conferred on all of Jesus’ followers, women and children included. But when the flock congregates and organizes, God wants us to play by his rules and not our own.

让我们不要忘记马太福音28：18 的给教会的大使命“去使万民做我门徒”，这是给所有耶稣跟随者的使命，包括妇女儿童。但是人聚集和组织起来的时候，神要我们按他的规则而不是我们的规则去做事。

This our article of faith answers very briefly by insisting that a man must be regularly called to teach and administer the sacraments.

本篇关于信心的教导以坚持认为一个人应该不断的呼召才能做话语的出口和施行圣礼作为对这个问题的回答。

There are several points to be considered:

有几点需要考虑：

1. Not all Christians are equally qualified and gifted for the public administration of Word and sacraments.

    并不是每个人都一样有资格和有恩赐来做公众话语的出口和施行圣礼。

2. Because children are under the 4th commandment, they too, would be disqualified for leadership positions in the church. Children must remain in proper subordination till they reach the natural age of maturity. If children were to publicly teach, this would imply a position of superiority, as teacher is over his pupils. In Jesus’ day, Rabbis (teachers) were not able to be considered authoritative until they reached the age of 30, the year our Savior’s ministry began.

    因为小孩子都在第四条诫命的范围内，所以他们也没有资格来做教会的领袖。小孩子在成熟年龄之前都要学习顺服。如果小孩子要公开的教导别人，就意为这小孩的地位高于他人，然而学生不能大于先生。在耶稣的时代，拉比（老师）在30岁之前也就是耶稣开始他的事工之前没有人承认。

3. God created the man to be the head of the family, and the woman to be his helper. God wants this arrangement of his to be observed everywhere, also in the public work of the church. The temptation has been from the beginning to disregard it. Paul had to tell the Corinthians: “Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says” (I Cor. 14:34). He also instructed Timothy to guard carefully against any infringement of this order in the church of Asia: “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent” (I Timothy 2:11,12).

    神造男人做家庭的头，女人做帮手。神要处处都符合这种次序，在教会公共事工中也是如此。从最开始都有试探诱惑要人违背这个次序。保罗不得不告诉哥林多人： 妇女在会中要闭口不言，像在圣徒的众教会一样。因为不准他们说话。他们总要顺服，正如律法所说的。（林前14:34）。他还告诫提摩太要谨防亚细亚的教会中有违背这种次序的行为：女人要沉静学道，一味的顺服。我不许女人讲道，也不许他辖管男人，只要沉静。（提摩太前书2:11,12）

I Timothy 3:1-13 Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 2 Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 3 not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 4 He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. 5 (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) 6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 7 He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap. 8 In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 9 They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons. 11 In the same way, the women[c] are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything. 12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 13Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.

提摩太前书3:1-13----1 人若想得监督的职分，就是羡慕善工。这话是可信的。2 作监督的，必须无可指责，只作一个妇人的丈夫，有节制，自守，端正。乐意接待远人，善于教导。3 不因酒滋事，不打人，只要温和，不争竞，不贪财。4 好好管理自己的家，使儿女凡事端庄顺服。5 人若不知道管理自己的家，焉能照管神的教会呢。6 初入教的不可作监督，恐怕他自高自大，就落在魔鬼所受的刑罚里。7 监督也必须在教外有好名声，恐怕被人毁谤，落在魔鬼的网罗里8 论执事的也是如此，必须端庄，不一口两舌，不好喝酒，不贪不义之财。9 要存清洁的良心，固守真道的奥秘。10 这等人也要先受试验。若没有可责之处，然后叫他们作执事。11 女执事（原文作女人）也是如此，必须端庄，不说谗言，有节制，凡事忠心。12 执事只要作一个妇人的丈夫，好好管理儿女和自己的家。13 因为善作执事的，自己就得到美好的地步，并且在基督耶稣里的真道上大有胆量。

Agree/Disagree: leaders of the church should be held to a higher standard than their members because God holds them to a higher standard.

同意/不同意：教会的领袖应该有更高的标准要求因为神会给他们更高的要求。

I Corinthians 4:16-17 Therefore I urge you to imitate me. 17 For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.

哥林多前书 4:16-17 所以我求你们效法我。因此我已打发提摩太到你们那里去。他在主里面，是我所亲爱有忠心的儿子。他必提醒你们，记念我在基督里怎样行事，在各处各教会中怎样教导人。

From what we know, the distinction that was often made between the overseer (bishop) and the deacon (elder) was mainly that the overseer was chiefly engaged in administering the means of grace, while the latter had charge of the business end of the congregation, especially the care of the poor, although they did not neglect the service of the Word when the opportunity presented itself.

如我们所知，监督（主教）和执事（长老）之间主要区别就是监督主要是管理恩典的途径，后者主要是负责会众的事情，尤其是关心穷苦人，但是当有机会的时候他们都会做话语的服侍。

You might notice that a little more emphasis on honesty is given to the deacon, perhaps because of the business end of the ministry. Read the following…

你可能注意到对执事来说诚实要求更多一点，这也许是因为他们所做的事工。请读以下经文。

Titus 1:7 Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.

提多书 1:7 监督既是　神的管家，必须无可指责，不任性、不暴躁、不因酒滋事、不打人、不贪无义之财。

I Peter 5:2 Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;

彼得前书 5:2 务要牧养在你们中间　神的群羊，按著　神旨意照管他们；不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心；也不是因为贪财，乃是出于乐意；

Since they were entrusted with the distribution of gifts of money and food to the poor, the possibility was either that they might falsify accounts or embezzle funds.

因为执事被委托去分给穷人金钱和食物，有可能他们会伪造账目或贪污资金。

Agree/Disagree: Paul considered the office of Pastor as possessing greater dignity and worth than that of a deacon.

同意/不同意：保罗认为牧师比执事更有尊荣和更高贵。

I Timothy 5:17 The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.

提摩太前书 5:17 那善于管理教会的长老，当以为配受加倍的敬奉。那劳苦传道教导人的，更当如此。

Acts 6:3-5 Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 4 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.”  5 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.

使徒行传6:3-5 所以弟兄们，当从你们中间选出七个有好名声，被圣灵充满，智慧充足的人，我们就派他们管理这事。但我们要专心以祈祷传道为事。大家都喜悦这话，就拣选了司提反，乃是大有信心，圣灵充满的人，又拣选腓利，伯罗哥罗，尼迦挪，提门，巴米拿，并进犹太教的安提阿人尼哥拉。

Remember that Pastors are elders too, according to the words of Peter. Read the following…

要知道根据彼得的话牧师也是长老。请读以下经文…

I Peter 5:1-2 To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed: 2 Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;


 ![](/images/note/ags/20-6.jpg#right)




彼得前书 5:1-2 我这作长老、作基督受苦的见证、同享后来所要显现之荣耀的，劝你们中间与我同作长老的人：务要牧养在你们中间　神的群羊，按著　神旨意照管他们；不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心；也不是因为贪财，乃是出于乐意；

Note: Preaching and teaching were not qualifications for the public ministry of deacon/elder. But notice that some deacons had the ability to preach and teach like Stephen.

注：会讲道和能教导不是做执事/长老事工的必须条件。但是确实有些执事像司提反一样有讲道的能力。

There must be order in God’s church. Luther once made the comment. “All Christians certainly have the right to baptize. But if all Christians would jump to baptize a newborn child, why, Luther said, they would drown the poor thing.”

在神的教会中必定有次序。路德这样说：“所有基督徒都有施洗的权柄。但是如果所有的基督徒都争先恐后跟新生儿施洗的话，路德说，他们会把小孩子淹死的。”

I Corinthians 14:33 “God is not a God of disorder but of peace.” Then in verse 40 Paul says, “But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.”

哥林多前书 14:33 “ 因为神不是叫人混乱，乃是叫人安静”。然后在40节保罗又说，“凡事都要规规矩矩的按着次序行。”

How can order be best maintained in a group where all have equal rights? They cannot all speak at once. They cannot all baptize; they cannot all commune. They must come to some agreement. And since the gifts that God gives to his children are not all equally distributed, we regularly issue a “call” to those who are equipped to serve in such a capacity.

如何才能最好的在人人平等的一群人中维持次序呢？不能所有人一同讲话。不能所有人都施洗：不能所有人都领圣餐。必须有一些约定。因为神所给儿女的恩赐不同，所以对有相应恩赐可以服侍的人我们通常需要“呼召”。
