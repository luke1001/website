Confession in the churches is not abolished among us; for it is not usual to give the body of the Lord, except to them that have been previously examined and absolved. And  the people are most carefully taught concerning faith in the absolution, about which formerly there  was profound silence. Our people are taught that they should highly prize the absolution, as being the voice of God, and pronounced by God's command. The power of the Keys is set forth in its beauty and they are reminded what great consolation it brings to anxious consciences, also, that God requires faith to believe such absolution as a voice sounding from heaven, and that such faith in Christ truly obtains and receives the forgiveness of sins. Aforetime satisfactions were immoderately extolled;  of faith and the merit of Christ and the righteousness of faith no mention was made; wherefore, on this point, our churches are by no means to be blamed. For this even our adversaries must needs concede  to us that the doctrine concerning repentance has been most diligently treated and laid open by our teachers.

我们教会并没有废弃认罪。因为平常除预先经过考验并被宣赦的人以外，我们不把主的身体施给人。关于宣赦所当有的信，我们极其留心教导人。这却是从前人所缄默不言的。我们又教导人应当重视宣赦的话，因为这是上帝的声音，由上帝的命令而宣告。我们又尊重天国钥匙的权柄，告诉人这与恐怖的良心有何等大的安慰；又告诉人上帝叫我们必须相信宣赦的话，如同从天上发出的声音，必须相信因信基督可实实在在得着赦罪的恩典。从前行善补罪的教理极受赞扬，信与基督的功劳及因信称义的道理却没有人传讲。因此在这事上我们教会决不应受责备。因为连抵挡我们的人也不能不承认我们最殷勤讲解传布悔改的道理。

• The matter of Confession was discussed at some length in these studies in Article XI. This article, however, not only reiterates the importance of Confession, but also serves as a reminder to the Roman Catholic Church that the Lutherans have changed the order of service and altered it where it needed to be altared, but did not abolish it.

关于认罪在本课程第六篇中有一定篇幅的讨论。本篇不仅重述认罪的重要性而且旨在使罗马天主教知道路德宗只是改革了崇拜流程和在一些必要的地方做了修改，并没有废除它。

Recall from Matthew 16 when Peter had confessed Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus in turn said to him: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (16:19). This was given, not just to Peter, but eventually to all the disciples, as Jesus addressed them all indirectly in Matthew 18:18, saying, “I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth,” etc.

回忆在马太福音16章中彼得承认耶稣是基督，是永生神的儿子，耶稣反过来对他说：我要把天国的钥匙给你。凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑。凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放（16:19）。天国的钥匙不仅赐给了彼得而是最终赐给了所有的门徒，耶稣在马太福音18:18直接明了的对他们说：我实在告诉你们，你们在地上捆绑的，等等。

Consider the Wonderful Comfort of the Keys!

想一下钥匙给我们带来多大的安慰！

A person does not have to search for the forgiveness of sins; a person doesn’t have to appeal to a saint in heaven, or make his or her appeal to a priest here on earth. No, the great treasure of forgiveness is given away free of charge by the work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

人不需要来寻找救恩；人不需要向天上的圣徒呼求或呼求地上的神父。不需要，赦罪的宝贵恩典藉着我们的主耶稣基督白白的赐给我们了。

The Keys that open this treasure house of forgiveness were given to sinners just like you and me, who have also found their peace in Jesus through his atoning work on the cross. As released sinners, the church (body of believers) has been given this special authority to unlock the prison doors of terror that hold a sinner in who does not yet know Christ love and forgivenes.

通向这宝贵恩典之门的钥匙被赐给了像你我一样的罪人，我们也曾藉着耶稣在十架上的救赎工作找到了平安。作为得释放的罪人，教会（信徒组合）被赐给特殊的权柄来打开禁锢那些不认识基督的爱和赦免之人的恐惧之门。

Therefore, a sinner using these keys, must use them without hesitation. Christians using these keys do not speak in place of God, but rather on God’s behalf. Therefore, their voice is really the voice of God. Naturally, it is through faith in Jesus, that the sinner confessing his sins, receives the joy of being absolved of his/her sins through the Christian as though it were God himself.

因此罪人要毫不迟延的使用这些钥匙。使用这些钥匙的基督徒不是替神说话而是代表神说话。因此他们的话就是神的话。很自然地，罪人是因着对耶稣的信而承认自己的罪，藉着基督徒就如同藉着神自己一样得到赦罪的喜乐。

In the second point of the article, they point out the error of the Roman Catholic Church that seems to insist on a counting of past sins…

在本文第二点中他们指出罗马天主教坚持数算过去的罪的错误之举…

But of Confession they teach that an enumeration of sins is not necessary, and that consciences be not burdened with anxiety to enumerate all sins, for it is impossible to recount all sins, as the Psalm 19:13 testifies: Who can understand his errors? Also Jeremiah 17:9 :  The heart is deceitful; who can know it? But if no sins were forgiven, except those that are recounted,  consciences could never find peace; for very many sins they neither see  nor can remember. The ancient writers also testify that an enumeration is not necessary. For in the Decrees, Chrysostom is quoted,  who says thus: I say not to you that you should disclose yourself in public, nor that you accuse yourself before others, but I would have you obey the prophet who says: "Disclose thy way before God." Therefore confess your sins before God, the true Judge, with prayer. Tell your errors, not with the tongue, but with the memory of your conscience, etc.  And the Gloss (Of Repentance, Distinct. V, Cap. Consideret) admits that Confession is of human right only [not commanded by Scripture, but ordained by the Church].  Nevertheless, on account of the great benefit of absolution, and because it is otherwise useful to the conscience, Confession is retained among us.

关于认罪他们教导一一列举罪是没有必要的，不应该因为列举罪而使良心产生负担也不可能数算所有的罪，如诗篇19:13为证：谁能知道自己的错失呢？还有耶利米书17:9：人心比万物都诡诈，坏到极处，谁能识透呢。如果罪只有被罗列出来才能得赦免的话，良心永远不能平安；因为很多的罪他们不曾看见也不曾记得。古代的作者也证实罗列所有的罪是没有必要的。在法令中引用克里索斯托的话：我并不是说你要在众人面前公开自己，也不是在别人面前指责自己，我是要你遵守先知所说的“将你的路向神显明”。因此在神真正的审判者面前要祷告认自己的罪。不是用你的舌头，而是用你的心承认你的罪，等等。Gloss (Of Repentance, Distinct. V, Cap. Consideret)承认认罪是人的权力［不是圣经规定的，而是教会设立的］。尽管如此因为赦罪给我们带来很大祝福，认罪使良心受益，因此我们保留了认罪。

Notes: We must never lose sight of the chief purpose of confession, namely, that troubled consciences be revived with the assurance of the forgiveness of their sins; and anything that tends to obstruct this comfort is an abuse.

注：我们永远不能忽视认罪的主要目的，也就是不安的良心因赦罪的确据而得安慰；任何与之相左的都是滥用。

Once again, we see the Lutheran forefathers make an appeal to the church historic in their appeal to the Roman Catholic Church.

我们看到路德宗前辈们再一次向罗马教会呼吁也是历史性的一次。

Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople supports what the Lutherans were teaching which brings credibility to their teaching since the Roman Catholic Church places as much emphasis on the Church fathers as they do the Bible.

克里索斯托君士坦丁堡的主教支持路德宗的教导，因为自从罗马天主教把教会前贤放在跟圣经同等地位之后他们就一直从之获益匪浅。

• The abuses discussed in this Article are closely related to the false opinions concerning certain church usages which were studied in connection with Article XV. There the proper attitude of Christians over against church holidays and festivals and other ceremonial customs of the church was shown from the Word of God. In the present Article XXVI, the abuses concerning the distinction of meats are investigated. The Article falls into two main divisions. In the first, the idea that abstaining from certain meats on certain prescribed days brings with it several dangerous errors. In the second, the truth is set forth that the observance of any distinction of meats and of other exercises devised by man does not merit grace and forgiveness of sins.

本篇所讨论的滥用跟我们学过的第十五篇中的有关教会惯例的一些错误观点密切相关。在那一篇中根据神的话向我们显明了基督徒看待教会节假日和其它一些仪式和传统的正确态度。在接下来第二十六篇中探讨的是关于戒荤的滥用。文章主要分两部分，在第一部分，在某些特定的日子不能吃一些特定的肉的观点有几个严重的错误。在第二部分，真理已经摆在我们面前就是守一些戒荤的规定和其它的人所定的规定不能赢得恩典和赦罪。
