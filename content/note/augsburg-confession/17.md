Of Repentance they teach that for those who have fallen after Baptism there is remission of sins whenever they are converted; and that the Church ought to impart absolution to those thus returning to repentance. Now, repentance consists properly of these two parts: One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that, for Christ’s sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors. Then good works are bound to follow, which are the fruits of repentance.

关于悔改他们教导受洗后再跌倒的，无论什么时候回转罪都蒙赦免，教会也应该饶恕赦免他们。悔改分为两部分：一是悔罪，或良心上因认识罪而起的恐惧；另一个是信心，是从福音或赦罪而来的，是相信因基督的缘故罪必得赦，使良心得安慰免受恐惧搅扰。然后要有好的行为伴随作为悔改的果子。

• In previous lessons we talked about confession and absolution as well as the action a congregation of believers should take toward such a person who has fallen into sin but appeals to their brothers and sisters for forgiveness. Today’s Bible study will define repentance according to Scripture.

在上节课中谈到认罪和赦免以及落入罪中的人请求弟兄姊妹原谅时教会应该如何去做。今天我们根据圣经来认识悔改。

Our article of faith this morning very definitively speaks of two distinct parts of repentance:

我们今早关于信心的课程很确定地谈到悔改的两个截然不同的方面：

1. Contrition

    悔罪

2. Faith.

    信心

These are two directly opposite feelings as we shall see today.

我们今天将会看到两种完全不同的感觉。

![](/images/note/ags/17-1.jpg#right)

Contrition or remorse is a very unpleasant feeling. The heart is filled with so much fear that often it sees despair as the only route of escape. This is especially true of those without faith in Jesus Christ. Imagine feeling guilty, feeling condemned, and all we can see in our future is a god waiting to punish us. If we don’t know who the true God is, this feeling will be the result of every guilty feeling a human experiences. The good news is that we Christians have the remedy for such a feeling. It’s the cross of Jesus! The second part of repentance is faith (assurance), a very pleasant feeling, filling the heart with hope and cheer. Why? Because the charges against us on account of our sins cannot be upheld; they will have to be ruled out by the Supreme Judge. Our guilt has been removed. We shall not die, but live eternally in heaven—a very pleasant feeling.

悔罪或懊悔是非常难受的。心中充满了恐惧以致绝望没有出路。对没有信耶稣基督的人来说尤为如此。想象一下负罪得感觉，受谴责得感觉，唯一我们可以看到的就是将来有一位神等着惩罚我们。如果我们不认识真神，这将是人类所有负罪感的最终结果。可喜的是我们基督徒对这种感觉有医治方法。那就是耶稣的十字架！悔改的第二部分是信心（确据），非常美妙的感觉让我们的心充满喜乐和盼望。为什么？因为对我们罪的指控不再能成立；它们都被最高审判官一笔勾销了。我们的罪被除去了。我们不再会死反得天上的永生—非常美妙的感觉。

Let us look to the Scriptures to see both examples (fear/faith) intertwined in the repentance of a Christian.

让我们一起看圣经中交织于基督徒悔改过程中的二者（恐惧/信心）的例子。

Job 42:6 “Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.”

约伯记 42:6 因此我厌恶自己，在尘土和炉灰中懊悔。

The reason Job spoke these words is mentioned earlier in the book when he said, “Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.”

约伯之所以说这些话的原因在之前提到过，他说道：“我所说的，是我不明白的。这些事太奇妙，是我不知道的”。

1. What sort of attitude did Job express regarding his actions of speaking about God as though he was being unfairly treated by God?

    约伯是以什么态度提到自己曾经说神对待他不公正的？

    Matthew 11:21 “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.”

    马太福音11:21“哥拉汛哪，你有祸了，伯赛大阿，你有祸了，因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了”。

2. What do these words of Jesus teach us about repentance? Are some people in the world given a greater chance to see the nature of their sin than other people?

    耶稣的这些话对悔改有什么教导 ？世上会有一些人比其他人更容易认清罪的本质吗？

    Psalm 32:3-4 “When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.”

    诗篇 32： 3-4 我闭口不认罪的时候，因终日唉哼，而骨头枯乾。黑夜白日，你的手在我身上沉重。我的精液耗尽，如同夏天的乾旱。

    • David gives us insight to the despairing feelings of guilt in this penitential Psalm. And again he describes the feeling of guilt to us in another Psalm. Read the following...

    在这篇忏悔的诗篇中大卫让我们进一步看到因罪带来的绝望的感觉。诗人还在另外一篇中为我们描述了负罪的感觉。读一下经文…

    Psalm 38:3-8 Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness because of my sin. My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly. I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning. My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart”

    诗篇 38:3-8因你的恼怒，我的肉无一完全。因我的罪过，我的骨头也不安宁。我的罪孽高过我的头，如同重担叫我担当不起。因我的愚昧，我的伤发臭流脓。我疼痛，大大拳曲，终日哀痛。我满腰是火。我的肉无一完全。我被压伤，身体疲倦。因心里不安，我就唉哼。

    Contrition and sorrow over sin won’t always stir up this sort of emotion as David expresses in the previous two Psalms. While most of us can probably relate with David over the internal struggle and agony, we shouldn’t judge the sincerity of one’s repentance because they didn’t run outside like Peter and “weep bitterly” (Luke 22:62).

    因罪而来的懊悔和痛苦并不总会带来如大卫在之前的诗篇里两次所描述的那样的感觉。我们现在大部分人都爱把大卫跟内心的痛苦和挣扎联系起来，我们不应该因为别人没有像彼得一样跑出去“痛哭”就怀疑别人悔改的真实性。（路加福音22:62）

3. Agree or disagree: Contrition is necessary for repentance to be possible.

    同意或不同意： 悔罪是悔改的必要。

4. Agree or disagree: Contrition is not the most important part of repentance.

    同意或不同意：悔罪是悔改的最重要部分。

    Even a very deep, heart-felt sincerity over a past sin does not assure one of genuine repentance. For who could have been troubled more about his sin and felt a deeper and more painful remorse than did Judas Iscariot? In his depression he not only was troubled by thoughts of suicide, but he actually went and hanged himself (Matthew 27:5) and he went to “go where he belongs” (Acts 1:25).

    即便为罪有发自肺腑的深深的痛悔也不代表会有真正的悔改。因为有谁比加略人犹大更为自己的罪备受折磨和深深痛悔呢？因为深深的懊悔他不仅想死的念头，而且出去把自己吊死了（马太福音27：5），他去了“自己的地方”（使徒行传1:25）。

    This leads us to the most important ingredient to repentance…

    这为我们揭开悔改最重要的部分…

    **FAITH! 信心！**

5. In the first part of repentance that is called contrition, where does the person look? (backward or forward)

    在悔改的第一部分悔罪，人是看哪里的？（向前还是向后）

    Consider the following passages that begin by calling people to first look backwards. In other words, at what they have done with their life…

    思考以下一开始就让人往后看的经节。换句话说，也就是看自己曾经做过的事…

    Peter said to Simon, the sorcerer of Samaria, “Repent of this wickedness” (Acts 8:22).

    彼得对撒玛利亚行邪术的西门说：“你当懊悔你这罪恶”（使徒行传8:22）。

    Paul warns the Corinthians that he hopes he will not find among them any “who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged” (II Corinthians 12:21).

    保罗警告哥林多人他希望不要在他们中间看到“许多人从前犯罪，行污秽奸淫邪荡的事，不肯悔改”（哥林多后书12:21）。

6. In the second part of repentance called faith - where does a sinner look? (backwards or forwards)

    在悔改的第二部分也就是信心—罪人是往哪里看的？（向前还是向后）

    Read the following…
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/17-3.jpg#right)

    请读以下经文…

    Acts 20:21 “I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.”

    使徒行传20:21 又对犹太人，和希利尼人，证明当向神悔改，信靠我主耶稣基督。

7. Because faith embraces the merits of our Lord Jesus, what does it look towards God for?

    因为信心可以使我们接受主耶稣的大功，信心是向神求什么呢？

8. Can he or she be confident that they receive this forgiveness?

    他或她可以确信他们会得到赦免吗？

    Is it any wonder that we see repentance, faith, and forgiveness so closely attached in several Scripture passages? The risen Lord said to his disciples on the way to Emmaus…

    在一些经文中我们看到悔改、信心和赦免如此紧密的联系在一起，岂不妙哉？在到以马忤斯的路上复活主对他的门徒们说…

    Luke 24:47 “Repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations”

    路加福音 24:47并且人要奉他的名传悔改赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。
    
    Peter accordingly encouraged his terror-stricken hearers on Pentecost:

    彼得在五旬节鼓励心中恐惧的听众：

    Acts 2:38-39 “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”

    使徒行传 2:38-39彼得说，你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵。


    And to the Jewish Council at Jerusalem he announced:

    对耶路撒冷犹太人的公会他又宣告：

    Acts 5:31 “God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.”

    使徒行传 5:31神且用右手将他高举，叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心，和赦罪的恩，赐给以色列人。

    Consider the reaction of the angels of heaven, to whom the Bible accredits for rejoicing when one sinner repents…

    想象天上天使的反应，圣经上提到当一个罪人悔改时天使所有的喜悦…

    Luke 15:7,10 
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/17-4.jpg#right)
    
    7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.

    10 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

    路加福音 15:7,10我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在天上也要这样为他欢喜，较比为九十九个不用悔改的义人，欢喜更大。10我告诉你们，一个罪人悔改，在神的使者面前，也是这样为他欢喜。

    You don’t suppose they are rejoicing over the poor soul who is writhing in agony over his sins, perhaps even entertaining thoughts of suicide to end it all, do you? They do not rejoice in our pains, but they do rejoice like the man who found his lost sheep or the woman when she found her piece of silver.

    你不会以为他们会为着因罪痛苦挣扎甚或痛不欲生以求解脱的那些可怜的灵魂欢喜快乐，是吧？他们不会因着我们的痛苦喜乐， 而是像那个找到丢失之羊的人或找到丢失银钱的妇人一样喜乐。

    Our article of faith therefore teaches that this faith comforts the conscience and delivers it from terrors.

    这篇关于信心讲章教导我们信心会使我们的良心得安慰并且脱离恐惧。

    How can this be? Can the conscience really forget the pain that it has caused his God? Which feeling dominates in the heart of the Christian? That will ultimately be determined by the strength of a person’s faith. The stronger the faith, the more the soul clings to its forgiveness in Jesus. The weaker the faith, the more doubts the Christian has of his or her salvation and forgiveness in Jesus.

    这怎么可能呢？良心果真能完全忘记它曾经给神带来的伤害吗？基督徒心中什么感觉占主导地位呢？这归根结底有一个人的信心的强弱来决定的。信心越强，灵魂也就越会依赖耶稣的赦免。信心越弱，基督徒也就越会疑惑耶稣的救恩和赦免。

    Galatians 5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

    加拉太书 5:1基督释放了我们，叫我们得自由，所以要站立得稳，不要再被奴仆的轭挟制。

    Philippians 4:4 “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!”

    腓立比书 4:4 你们要靠主常常喜乐。我再说，你们要喜乐。

9. What do you think??? Are either of these two parts (contrition & faith) produced by the sinner himself?

    你有什么看法？这两部分（悔罪&信心）有哪一个是罪人自己产生的吗？

10. What do you think? Is it more accurate to say that the writhing pain that David felt over his sin was self-made or do you think that God laid this grief upon his heart through the conscience and then terror seized him very much against his will.

    你有什么看法？更准确的说大卫为罪而有的痛苦挣扎是来自自己呢还是神使他良心感到难受继而内心不自觉的被恐惧所占据。
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/17-5.jpg#right)


    Think about it: David had committed a grievous double sin of adultery and murder. Then he had married the widowed Bathsheba and expected to enjoy happy fruits of his sin. He had no intention of working himself into a feeling—a very painful feeling—of remorse. But he was forced into it against his will.

    请思考：大卫犯了严重的淫乱和谋杀双重罪。然后他娶了寡妇拔示巴准备享受罪中之乐。他没有打算让自己陷入这种感受之中—非常痛苦的感受—懊悔。但是他不由自主的陷入其中。

    So it is with every Christian. The sinner does not make up his mind by himself to have a contrite heart. He would rather enjoy his life in sin and hope for pleasant fruits of his sin. Contrition does not begin until God thunders his condemnation into the sinner’s conscience and strikes terrors into his conscience through the knowledge of sin. This we call the preaching of the Holy Law of God. Listen to its thundering message from the lips of the prophet Nathan who came to David and confronted him with his sin…

    对每个基督徒来说都是一样。不是罪人自己决定要有悔罪的心。罪人更愿意享罪中之乐和期待罪之乐果。只有当神将谴责放到罪人良心里使罪人因认识罪而恐惧时才会有悔罪。我们称之为传扬神的圣律。听来自先知拿单针对大卫使大卫认识到自己罪过的如雷鸣一样的信息…

    2 Samuel 1-14---1 The LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, “There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. 2 The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, 3 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. 4 “Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”  5 David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this must die! 6 He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”  Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. 8 I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. 9 Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 10 Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’  11 “This is what the LORD says: ‘Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight. 12 You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’” 13 Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.”  Nathan replied, “The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die. 14 But because by doing this you have shown utter contempt for[a] the LORD, the son born to you will die.”

    撒母耳记下 12 耶和华差遣拿单去见大卫。拿单到了大卫那里，对他说，在一座城里有两个人，一个是富户，一个是穷人。2富户有许多牛群羊群。3穷人除了所买来养活的一只小母羊羔之外，别无所有。羊羔在他家里和他儿女一同长大，吃他所吃的，喝他所喝的，睡在他怀中，在他看来如同女儿一样。4有一客人来到这富户家里。富户舍不得从自己的牛群羊群中取一只预备给客人吃，却取了那穷人的羊羔，预备给客人吃。5大卫就甚恼怒那人，对拿单说，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，行这事的人该死。6他必偿还羊羔四倍。因为他行这事，没有怜恤的心。7拿单对大卫说，你就是那人。耶和华以色列的神如此说，我膏你作以色列的王，救你脱离扫罗的手。8我将你主人的家业赐给你，将你主人的妻交在你怀里，又将以色列和犹大家赐给你。你若还以为不足，我早就加倍地赐给你。9你为什么藐视耶和华的命令，行他眼中看为恶的事呢。你借亚扪人的刀杀害赫人乌利亚，又娶了他的妻为妻。10你既藐视我，娶了赫人乌利亚的妻为妻，所以刀剑必永不离开陪的家。11耶和华如此说，我必从你家中兴起祸患攻击你。我必在你眼前把你的妃嫔赐给别人，他在日光之下就与她们同寝。12你在暗中行这事，我却要在以色列众人面前，日光之下，报应你。13大卫对拿单说，我得罪耶和华了。拿单说，耶和华已经除掉你的罪，你必不至于死。14只是你行这事，叫耶和华的仇敌大得亵渎的机会，故此，你所得的孩子必定要死。

    • Maybe it is here where we ought to briefly pause and see the Roman error involved in repentance. You see, they consider a third part to repentance, namely, contrition, confession, and then satisfaction for the offenses done.

    或许我们应该在这里稍停片刻来看一下罗马天主教在悔改上的错误。正如大家所知他们认为悔改分三部分：悔罪、认罪和弥补罪过。

    The first part they call by the same name that we do, but they mean something altogether different from what the Scriptures say about contrition. They mean a feeling of sorrow which a sinner produces deliberately in his own heart. Moreover, the sinner is demanded to produce a very deep feeling of remorse. They teach a person to work himself into an agony of despair so that he is doing something by which he removes the guilt and then merits forgiveness for his sin. This self-made contrition Luther calls a “manufactured” repentance.

    他们的第一部分跟我们的第一部分名字相同，但是他们指的意思却跟圣经说指的悔罪完全不同。他们指的是罪人自己产生的懊悔感。更甚的是，他们要求罪人要有很深的自责感。他们教导人要让自己有绝望的痛苦感并且通过这样做来除去罪过和赢得赦免。这种自创的悔罪被路德称为“杜撰的”悔改。

    Contrition over sin is not something a Christian can manufacture, but rather it is something that we suffer as a consequence to sin. This we call guilt! We suffer the terrors of God’s wrath pronounced in the preaching of the Law.

    因罪而来的悔罪不是基督徒自己可以创造的，而是我们所遭受的罪的结果。我们称之为负罪感！我们恐惧是因为知道律法而清楚的看到神的义怒。
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/17-7.jpg#right)

    Our new man is in constant conflict with the Old Adam. One way we strike him down is by reviewing the Law of God and reviewing the thunderbolt of Mt. Zion where the Ten Commandments were given in order to make us tremble with fear before the wrath of a divine Judge.

    我们的新人与老亚当格格不入。其中一个打倒他的方法就是来回顾神的律法和锡安山上的雷声，也就是神赐下十诫的地方，使我们因看到圣洁的审判官的怒气而胆战心惊。

11. Does this effort on our part ever merit Christ’s forgiveness?

    我们的努力能赢得神的赦免吗？

    So no matter whether we as Christians apply the law to ourselves, or whether God sends a Nathan to preach it to us, or whether he through special circumstances brings us to realize how badly we have sinned and deserved his temporal and eternal punishment, contrition is always something that we suffer, never anything that we produce ourselves by our own effort, least of all, anything by which we make ourselves worthy of God’s grace or merit forgiveness of our sin in whole or part.

    所以不管是我们基督徒因为对照律法，或者是神派一个拿单来向我们指出，或神通过特殊的环境让我们认识到我们犯了何等严重的罪，应该受到立即和永恒的惩罚，悔罪是我们所经历的，而不是靠我们自己所创造的，更不是使我们配得神的恩典或配使神赦免我们的一部分或全部的罪。

    That is why our article of faith today says, “the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that, for Christ’s sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.”

    这也是为什么我们的讲章今天说：“另外一个是信心，也就是从福音而来的，或从赦免而来的，是相信因基督的缘故，罪必得赦，使良心可以得安慰，脱离恐惧。”

    Consider the feeling of pain David was going through prior to Nathan’s revealing of David’s sin…consider Nathan’s announcement of the Law – “You deserve to die!”… consider Nathan’s announcement of the gospel – “The Lord has taken away your sin!” And now apply these same steps to your own personal heart and I promise you that it will leap for joy, confident that our God in Christ Jesus has taken away our guilt!

    思考在拿单向大卫显明他的罪之前大卫所经历的痛苦感受… 思考拿单宣告神的律法—“你应该死！”…思考拿单宣告福音—“耶和华已除掉你的罪！”现在在自己的身上应用这些步骤，我保证你一定会欢呼雀跃，你必确信我们的神在主耶稣里已经除去我们的罪！

12. But how can a sinner who feels the terrors of God’s wrath and hell smiting his conscience and driving him to despair believe that the angry God whom he has provoked with his sins is ready to lay his anger aside and forgive us?

    一个畏惧神的怒气和地狱并且良心备受折磨以致绝望的罪人是如何能够相信因为他的罪而发怒的神会放下他的怒气并饶恕我们呢？

    It was a mighty deed of our God when he created the vast world out of nothing. No man can copy that work. But to bring faith forth out of fear, or hope out of despair, is infinitely more difficult. It is utterly beyond the ability of a sinner to believe in the forgiveness of God unless the Holy Spirit create this faith in his heart. Read the following…

    神从无造出广阔的世界是大能的事。没有人能模仿。但是从恐惧中带出信心，或绝望中带出希望却是更困难的事情。若不是圣灵在罪人心中产生信心，罪人根本没有这样的能力来相信神的赦免。如以下经文…

    1 Corinthians 12:3 Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

    哥林多前书 12:3 所以我告诉你们，被神的灵感动的，没有说耶稣是可咒诅的。若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说耶稣是主的。

    Just as contrition is not man-made, so it is that faith is not man-made either. God strikes terror into the heart of a haughty sinner, and God alone awakens faith in the heart of a despairing sinner. How does he do it? Take a look at the Jailer in Phillipi. His heart was filled with the terrors of death and hell and was even prepared to kill himself. The Bible tells us that he “came trembling before Paul and Silas. He then brought them out and asked, ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’” (Acts 16:29-30).

    正如悔罪不是人的工作一样信心也不是人的工作。神用恐惧来击打高傲罪人的心，神也在绝望的罪人心中唤醒信心。神是如何做到这一点的？让我们一起来看看腓立比的禁卒。他的心中充满死和地狱的恐惧甚至要寻短见。圣经告诉我们他“战战兢兢的俯伏在保罗西拉面前。又领他们出来说，二位先生，我当怎样行才能得救？”（使徒行传16:29-30）

13. What do you suppose the apostle Paul announced to this trembling sinner after he asked the question, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”

    ![](/images/note/ags/17-8.jpg#right)


    当这个战战兢兢的罪人问“二位先生，我当怎样行才能得救”时你觉得使徒保罗应该怎样回答？

    Acts 16:31-34 “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” 32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. 33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized. 34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.

    使徒行传 16:31-34 他们说，当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。 32他们就把主的道，讲给他和他全家的人听。 33当夜就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤。他和属乎他的人，立时都受了洗。 34于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭，他和全家，因为信了神，都很喜乐。

14. What do you think? Do you think the command to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ from Paul and Silas was a harsh command which he must obey as if they were laying down a condition for the jailor at Philippi to meet? Or do you think Paul and Silas were inviting the jailer to accept an invitation to accept a blessing which God had prepared for his despairing soul?

    你有什么看法？你认为保罗和西拉说的当信主耶稣基督是苛刻的命令，是他们给腓立比的禁卒设定的必须达到的条件吗？还是保罗跟西拉在邀请禁卒接受神给绝望中的灵魂所预备的祝福呢？

    **OUR SAVIOR’S GOSPEL INVITATIONS –我们救主的福音邀请-**

    Matthew 11:28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest…you will find rest for your souls.”

    马太福音 11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。

15. Who is invited to come?

    谁是受邀请的人？

    John 7:37 “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink…streams of living water will flow from within him.”

    约翰福音 7:37人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝。…从他复中要流出活水的江河来。

16. Who is invited to drink?

    谁可以来喝这水？

    John 6:35 “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”

    约翰福音 6:35耶稣说，我就是生命的粮。到我这里来的，必定不饿。信我的，永远不渴。只是我对你们说过，你们已经看见我，还是不信。凡父所赐给我的人，必到我这里来。到我这里来的，我总不丢弃他。

17. Who is invited to eat?

    谁可以来吃这粮？

    The word, then, is what creates the bond or trust in Jesus Christ for full and free absolution or forgiveness. And that is why our forefathers say, “Faith is born of the gospel, or absolution.”

    神的话是我们相信耶稣基督完全白白赦免和赦免之恩的确据。这也是为什么我们的前辈说：“信心来自福音或赦罪。”

    This is a mistake that we Christians so often make in our application of the gospel to others. We often feel like we have to “sell” the gospel with our logic and with our rhetoric as though we can somehow make its message more pleasing and enticing and effective. But no, the power comes from God and not from us. All our brilliant argumentation and persuasion does not add one iota of strength to the Word. For we with all our winsome talk are but clay jars, which add nothing of value to the treasure they contain. It is the word of the gospel alone that creates faith in a despairing heart.

    我们基督徒在他人身上应用福音时经常会犯这样一个错误。我们经常会用我们严密的逻辑和华丽的雄辩将福音“卖”给他人，好像这样可以使我们所传的福音更加有吸引力和有效。但事实不是如此，能力来自神而不是我们。我们漂亮的雄辩和劝说不能给神的话增加一丁点的力量。因为不论我们的言辞如何的引人注目它只不过是瓦器，丝毫不能增添瓦器中储存物的价值。单单是福音本身在绝望的心中产生信心。

    2 Corinthians 4:7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.

    哥林多后书 4:7我们有这宝贝放在瓦器里，要显明这莫大的力，是出于神，不是出于我们。

    Another short-coming on our part is to then take it a step further, when one does profess repentance and trust in the divine promises of Christ we become inclined to take credit for it. Another big mistake. We are but poor men and women taking the appeal of Almighty God forth into a world of darkness. If they believe its message – God gets all the credit! If they reject the message, they get all the blame.

    我们的另外一个缺点是越权，当别人悔改相信主耶稣的应许的时候我们会把荣耀归于自己。另外一个重大错误。我们仅仅是把全能神带到黑暗世界的一个卑微的人而已。如果别人相信这个信息—神是配得一切荣耀！如果别人拒绝这个信息，过错在于这个人。

    • Why then does faith justify us before God? Is it because we have faith that God chooses to overlook our sins? Is it because when faith appears in a human heart, faith will take up the battle against sin and will endeavor to do good works instead of constant evil works? And because there is hope that the sinner will henceforth lead a better, more Christian life, that God decides to overlook his sins and forgive them? Is this the reason why faith justifies? The answer is NO!!!!!!!

    为什么信心使我们在神面前称义呢？是因为我们有信心所以神就把我们的罪忽略不计了吗？是因为当信心产生于人心后它就会与罪争战会尽力去做好事而不是坏事了吗？因为罪人有希望从此过一个更好更像基督徒的生活所以神就决定忽略不计并且饶恕他们的罪吗？答案是否定的！

    • Faith is indeed a virtue demanded by God in the very first Commandment. But how weak, how imperfect our faith is as we continually look to the lusts of this world and what it has to offer us poor miserable sinners instead of trusting in God. If God were to consider the intrinsic value of our faith, would he not find much more to condemn in us than to reward us with? And is not the same true of the good works that flow out of faith? As Isaiah once said, “All our righteous acts are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6). No, the reason faith justifies is altogether different.

    信心确实是神在诫命第一条所要求的品行。但是如果我们只是注目在世界的欲望和世界带给罪人的东西而不是神的身上那信心是何等的软弱和有缺陷。如果神只是看我们的信心本身，我们身上岂不是有更多让神定罪而不是祝福的吗？从信心而来的好行为不也是如此吗？以赛亚曾说，“所有的义都像污秽的衣服”。（以赛亚书64:6）不，信心使我们称义是另有其因的。

    • When Paul and Silas invited the jailer at Philippi to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and then they spoke the word of the Lord to him, undoubtedly they told the jailer that the Lord Jesus Christ was the instrument of the Father’s anger who has already satisfied his anger against our sin by punishing Jesus in our place. He’s the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and was delivered into death for all of our offenses. In the resurrection of Jesus Christ, he was declared justified of all his sins, that is, our sins which had been laid on him. In other words, the sins of the world were completely covered by the death of Jesus; our guilt was entirely wiped out, as his resurrection attests to all of us.

    当保罗和西拉邀请腓立比的禁卒信主耶稣基督时，他们用神的话来告诉他，他们很确信的告诉禁卒因主耶稣为我们受的刑罚使天父为着我们的罪而有的怒气得到止息。他是神的羔羊除去世人罪孽的，受死是因我们的罪。当耶稣基督复活的时候，他宣告胜过了所有的罪而称义，也就是加于他的身上的我们的罪。换句话说世上所有的罪因为耶稣的死都被遮盖，主的复活明证我们的罪被完全的洗净。

    Romans 4:25 “He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.”

    罗马书 4:25 耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯，复活是为叫我们称义。

    Paul and Silas simply announced this righteousness of Christ to the jailer and invited him to believe it. And guess what? He received the message with JOY, as all of us Christians do!

    保罗和西拉仅仅是将基督的义告诉禁卒并邀请他相信。猜猜发生了什么？他欢欢喜喜的接受了这个信息，正如我们所有的基督徒所做的一样！


    • This, then, is what makes faith so valuable. It is never worth more than the object which it grasps. And since a Christian lays hold on the highest treasure that heaven and earth contain, the precious blood of the Lamb of God and his perfect righteousness, it possesses something with which it can stand in the judgment seat of God and with which it can quiet the terror-stricken conscience. That is why our article today says it comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.

    这就是让信心变得如此宝贵的因素。最宝贵的永远是信心所指的对象。基督徒抓住了天地间最大的财富也就是神的羔羊的血和完全的义，它可以使我们在神的审判宝座前站立的稳并且使我们倍受恐惧折磨的良心得到安慰。这也是为什么我们今天的这条说它使良心得安慰脱离恐惧。

    • Don’t mistake that to mean that the terrors of the conscience are forever gone and banished, never to return. That will not happen till we reach the church triumphant in the Kingdom of heaven. While we continue here on earth, sin will daily beset us, and the law of God, which we violate with our sins, will continue to strike terrors into our hearts. But painful though they may be, they shall not prevail; they shall not dominate our lives. Jesus says, in John 16:20 that “Our grief will turn to joy.”

    不要错以为这意味着心中的恐惧会一去不复返。这直到将来天国中教会完全得胜时才会发生。当我们还在地上的时候，罪就会持续不断的困扰我们，还有神的律法，当我们违反律法犯罪的时候它就会使我们的心恐惧。但是尽管它们可能痛苦但却不会失去控制，它们不会主宰我们的生命。耶稣在约翰福音16:20节说：“我们的忧愁将会变为喜乐”。

    • But for now, we receive a foretaste of what we will receive eternally when we repent of our sins. Just like the Jailer at Philippi “was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole family” (Acts 16:34).

    但是现在我们所得到的是我们悔改后在永恒中景况的一个征兆。正如腓立比的禁卒“因为信了神，都很喜乐—他和他的全家”（使徒行传16:34）。


    Our article goes on to state...Then good works are bound to follow, which are the fruits of repentance.

    我们的这一条继续谈到…随后要有好行为，作为悔改的果子。

    Don’t let your flesh deceive you. When our flesh first hears that our sins are forgiven out of the pure mercy of God without any merit or worthiness on our part, we are ready to jump to the conclusion that we can live our lives any way we want to, including pleasing our sinful flesh. The free forgiveness we receive from Christ is not a license for us to please our flesh and sin as we choose. Listen to the words of Paul…

    不要让你的肉体欺骗你。当我们的肉体一听到我们的罪单单因着神的恩典而不是我们优秀或配得的时候，我们会轻率的得出结论我们可以任意妄为的去生活包括使我们有罪的肉体去享乐。从主耶稣而来的白白的救恩并不是我们任意的使我们的肉体享乐和犯罪的免死金牌。让我们来听保罗的话语…

    Romans 6:1-2 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?

    罗马书 6:1-2 这样，怎么说呢。我们可以仍在罪中，叫恩典显多么。断乎不可。我们在罪上死了的人，岂可仍在罪中活着呢。

    Then Paul proceeds to tell us our death occurred when we were baptized into Christ. This wasn’t the first time Paul had been accused of such slanderous preaching. Some had been reportedly saying, “Let us do evil that good may result” (Romans 3:8), but Paul, with righteous indignation, rejects such an inference from the gospel saying, “Certainly not!” Then he goes on to say, “Their condemnation is deserved.”

    然后保罗继续告诉我们当我们受洗归主的时候死就发生了。这不是保罗第一次讲道被指控诽谤。有些人传说“让我们作恶以成善”（罗马书3:8），但是保罗出于义怒反驳这样的推理说“断乎不可！”然后他又接着说：“这等人定罪，是应该的”。

    To the Galatians Paul wrote, “You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature” (Galatians 5:13). Peter joins him in his warning, “Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil” (I Peter 2:16).

    对加拉太人保罗写道：“弟兄们，你们蒙召，是要得自由。只是不可将你们的自由当作放纵情欲的机会。”（加拉太书5:13）彼得也跟保罗一道警告：“你们虽是自由的，却不可藉着自由遮盖恶毒（或作阴毒），总要作神的仆人”（彼得前书2:16）。

    Having felt the painful burning of our conscience, should we return to it with open and idolatrous sin? As Christians, we have hopefully, more than burned the tips of our fingers by sin, but have felt the Almighty wrath of a vengeful God who thunders his sentence of death to him who sins but once! If that doesn’t strike terror in your conscience, then pinch yourself to see if you are alive.

    已经尝过自己良心痛苦煎熬的滋味，我们还会去把罪带回来吗？作为基督徒，我们希望罪所煎熬的不仅仅是我们的指头尖，而是感到神的义怒，只要哪怕只犯一次罪神的审判就是死！如果这不能让你的心感畏惧，那么掐一下自己看看自己是不是还活着。

    Then, when through faith, we have embraced the free forgiveness awarded to us by the merits of Jesus, undoubtedly our response will be one of great joy and happiness knowing that our terrible guilt was sentenced at the cross of our Lord.

    我们藉着信心领受了从耶稣而来的白白的赦免之恩，毫无疑问我们的反应将是欢喜快乐因为我们知道我们可怕的罪已经定在主的十字架上了。

    Should we now not strive to please him who atoned for our guilt by living a perfectly obedient for his Father in heaven on our behalf?

    我们应该尽力去讨这位为我们的缘故完全顺服天父的旨意并作了赎罪祭的主的喜悦吗？

    We heard how David felt in contrition. But now listen how David feels through faith, which embraces Christ’s forgiveness…

    我们听到了大卫悔罪时的感受。让我们再听大卫因信心领受基督的赦免时的感受…

    Psalm 103:1-5---Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits—who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

    诗篇 103:1-5我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华。凡在我里面的，也要称颂他的圣名。我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华，不可忘记他的一切恩惠。他赦免你的一切罪孽，医治你的一切疾病。 他救赎你的命脱离死亡，以仁爱和慈悲为你的冠冕。他用美物，使你所愿的得以知足，以致你如鹰返老还童。

18. Why do we say that if repentance is genuine, good works will automatically abound or follow?

    为什么我们说若果悔改是真实的，好行为会随之而来？
    
    ![](/images/note/ags/17-9.jpg#right)

    Consider the apple tree in the picture and you will understand the relationship that exists between the Christian and his/her good works to Jesus.

    想象一下苹果树的图片你就会理解基督徒和从耶稣来的好行为的关系。

19. What is the Apple tree dependent upon to drop healthy apples to the ground?

    苹果树靠什么结出好苹果？

    Now consider the words of Jesus and answer the same question…what is the sinner dependent upon to bear good fruits for the Kingdom of God?

    思考耶稣的话并回答同样的问题…罪人靠什么能够为神的国度结出好果子？

    John 15:1 -2 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. 2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.

    约翰福音15:1 -2“我是真葡萄树，我父是栽培的人. 凡属我不结果子的枝子，他就剪去。凡结果子的，他就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多。”

20. consider how the prophet Nathan pruned the apple tree of King David’s faith and enabled him to produce greater fruit for the Kingdom of God in the end.

    思考先知拿单是如何修剪大卫王的信心的苹果树以使他最后能为神的国度结出更美好的果子。

1 John 1:8-10 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.

约翰一书 1:8-10 我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了。我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义。我们若说自己没有犯过罪，便是以神为说谎的。他的道也不在我们心里了。

So, then, even repentance, true repentance, is a miracle wrought by God and not man. Thank God, then, that he does not postpone the forgiveness of our sins till he can examine our good works. Where he finds a broken and contrite heart and where he identifies even a spark of faith, there he treats us as his dear children, not laying a single sin to our charge any longer, but casting it all upon his dear Son’s back, which was beaten on our behalf. He then waits for good works to follow as fruits, which he accepts as our thanksgiving and in which he rejoices in spite of their imperfections.

所以，即便是悔改，真正的悔改也是由神而不是人所施行的神迹。感谢神，他没有推迟他的救赎直等到他可以查验我们的好行为。只有他发现一颗为罪伤心痛悔的心和哪怕一丁点的信心，他就会把我们看做他的孩子，不再让我们受罪的指控，并且把罪都放在他的儿子的身上也，就是为我们的缘故背负重担的那位。然后他期待我们会有好的行为作为果实，尽管我们的好行为不是完美的他也接受它们为我们的感恩祭。

Isaiah 42:3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.
