Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence. Nearly all the usual ceremonies are also preserved, save that the parts sung in Latin are interspersed here and there with German hymns, which have been added to teach the people. For ceremonies are needed to this end alone that the unlearned be taught [what they need to know of Christ]. And not only has Paul commanded to use in the church a language understood by the people 1 Cor. 14:2-9, but it has also been so ordained by man's law.  The people are accustomed to partake of the Sacrament together, if any be fit for it, and this also increases the reverence and devotion of public worship. For none are admitted except they be first examined. The people are also advised concerning the dignity and use of the Sacrament, how great consolation it brings anxious consciences, that they may learn to believe God, and to expect and ask of Him all that is good.  [In this connection they are also instructed regarding other and false teachings on the Sacrament.] This worship pleases God; such use of the Sacrament nourishes true devotion toward God. It does not, therefore, appear that the Mass is more devoutly celebrated among our adversaries than among us.

说我们教会废弃弥撒，这是人诬告我们。因为我们仍然保存弥撒，用至恭至敬的心举行。不但如此，凡通用仪式几莫不皆然。只有各段用拉丁文歌唱的仪式中我们杂用德文，这为的是教导人民而加入的。因为仪式的功用在乎教导无知识的人。不但保罗在林前14:2-9曾吩咐当用人们懂得的话语，人的法律也如此规定。人们已习于同领圣餐，只要他们是配领的；这在公众的礼仪上也增加恭敬和虔诚。因为不先行考察，就不准许什么人领受圣餐。我们又提醒人觉悟圣餐的价值和功用并觉悟对于恐怖的良心有何等大的安慰；使他们知道如何相信上帝，仰望而且恳求从祂手里得着一切益处。［在这里他们还教导有关圣餐的其它的和错误的学说］这种敬拜是上帝所喜悦的；如此领受圣礼可养成人向上帝的虔诚。因此，抵挡我们的人举行弥撒不见得比我们更虔诚。

But it is evident that for a long time this also has been the public and most grievous complaint of all good men that Masses have been basely profaned and applied to purposes of lucre.  For it is not unknown how far this abuse obtains in all the churches by what manner of men Masses are said only for fees or stipends, and how many celebrate them contrary to the Canons.  But Paul severely threatens those who deal unworthily with the Eucharist when he says, 1 Cor. 11:27: Whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  When, therefore our priests were admonished concerning this sin, Private Masses were discontinued among us, as scarcely any Private Masses were celebrated except for lucre's sake.

但有一件彰明较著久为一切善人公开而极抱怨的事，就是弥撒被人亵渎，藉以图利。这种弊端是如何通行于各教会，举行弥撒仅为得报酬得工价的是何种人，违背教条滥行弥撒的有多少人，都是无可讳言的。但保罗在林前11:27严厉地儆戒不按理用圣餐的人说：“所以无论何人不按理吃主的饼喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身主的血了”。所以我们教会的教牧既受劝导，明白了这罪，就废止了私行弥撒，因私行弥撒大都是只在图利。

Neither were the bishops ignorant of these abuses, and if they had corrected them in time, there would now be less dissension. Heretofore, by their own connivance, they suffered many corruptions to creep into the Church. Now, when it is too late, they begin to complain of the troubles of the Church, while this disturbance has been occasioned simply by those abuses which were so manifest that they could be borne no longer. There have been great dissensions concerning the Mass, concerning the Sacrament.  Perhaps the world is being punished for such long-continued profanations of the Mass as have been tolerated in the churches for so many centuries by the very men who were both able and in duty bound to correct them. For in the Ten Commandments it is written, Ex. 20:7: The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. But since the world began, nothing that God ever ordained seems to have been so abused for filthy lucre as the Mass.

众主教也并非不知道这些弊端，他们若曾随时纠正，现在就必少有纷争之事。他们从前一味掩饰，容忍许多腐败之事混入教会，到现在明是迟了，才为教会所受的祸害抱怨；因为这一次的扰乱非因别的事故，而是起于那些明显而无可再忍的弊端。论到弥撒，论到圣餐，有许多纷争之事。恐怕因这么多时亵渎弥撒，世界正在受刑罚；那些能加改正，亦应加改正的人却这么多年容忍这样的事流行教会。因为十条诫上写着说，出20:7：“妄称主名的主必不以他为无罪”。但自创世以来，似乎从未有滥用圣事图利如弥撒的。

There was also added the opinion which infinitely increased Private Masses, namely that Christ, by His passion, had made satisfaction for original sin, and instituted the Mass wherein an offering should be made for daily sins, venial and mortal. From this has arisen the common opinion that the Mass takes away the sins of the living and the dead by the outward act. Then they began to dispute whether one Mass said for many were worth as much as special Masses for individuals, and this brought forth that infinite multitude of Masses. [With this work men wished to obtain from God all that they needed, and in the mean time faith in Christ and the true worship were forgotten.]

另有一种使私行的弥撒无穷增加的意见就是：基督藉着祂所受的苦赎了人的原罪；祂设立弥撒，是要人藉此为日常所犯能赦和可致人死的罪献祭。接着又生出了一种通行的意见，谓弥撒的本身可以解除死人活人的罪孽。到了这一步，人就再争论起来，为多人同行弥撒是否与为一人行弥撒同样有效。因这种争论，就生出无穷无尽的弥撒来了。

Concerning these opinions our teachers have given warning that they depart from the Holy Scriptures and diminish the glory of the passion of Christ. For Christ's passion  was an oblation and satisfaction, not for original guilt only, but also for all other sins, as it is written to the Hebrews 10:10:  We are sanctified through the offering of Jesus Christ once for all. Also, Hebrews 10:14:  By one offering He hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. [It is an unheard-of innovation in the Church to teach that Christ by His death made satisfaction only for original sin and not likewise for all other sin. Accordingly it is hoped that everybody will understand that this error has not been reproved without due reason.]

论到这些意见，我们的传道人常训诲人说，这些意见不合圣经，而且有损于基督受苦的光荣。因为基督受苦不是单为原罪，也为一切别的罪，如来10:10记着说：“我们……靠耶稣基督只一次献上祂的身体，就得以成圣”。又说来10:14：“因为祂一次献祭，便叫那得以成圣的人永远完全”。［教导基督受死只是为原罪而没有为其它罪做救赎是前所未闻的。相应的也希望大家知道对这种错误的抨击不是没有理由的。］

Scripture also teaches that we are justified before God through faith in Christ, when we believe that our sins are forgiven for Christ's sake.  Now if the Mass take away the sins of the living and the dead by the outward act justification comes of the work of Masses, and not of faith, which Scripture does not allow.

圣经又教训人，我们在上帝面前称义是因信基督，就是相信我们罪得赦免是因基督的缘故。但如弥撒的本身可解除活人死人的罪，那么称义就是因行弥撒，而非因信而来；这不是圣经所能容忍的。

But Christ commands us, Luke 22:19: This do in remembrance of Me; therefore the Mass was instituted that the faith of those who use the Sacrament should remember what benefits it receives through Christ, and cheer and comfort the anxious conscience. For to remember Christ is to remember His benefits,  and to realize that they are truly offered unto us.  Nor is it enough only to remember the history; for this also the Jews and the ungodly can remember.  Wherefore the Mass is to be used to this end, that there the Sacrament [Communion] may be administered to them that have need of consolation; as Ambrose says: Because I always sin, I am always bound to take the medicine. [Therefore this Sacrament requires faith, and is used in vain without faith.]

但基督吩咐我们，路加福音22:19，行弥撒为的是记念祂。所以设立弥撒，是叫凡领圣餐者的信可以记念从基督得了什么恩赐，并且可以使恐怖的良心得苏醒安慰。因为记念基督，就是记念祂的恩赐，又觉得这些恩赐实在是赐给我们了。单记得那受苦的历史是不够的；因为犹太人和恶人也能如此。所以用弥撒必须为着要把圣餐赐给需要安慰的人而用；如安波罗修所说：“因我常常犯罪，所以应当常常得这药。”［因此圣礼需要信心，没有信心圣礼也是枉然。］

Now, forasmuch as the Mass is such a giving of the Sacrament, we hold one communion every holy-day, and, if any desire the Sacrament, also on other days, when it is given to such as ask for it.  And this custom is not new in the Church; for the Fathers before Gregory make no mention of any private Mass, but of the common Mass [the Communion] they speak very much. Chrysostom says that the priest stands daily at the altar, inviting some to the Communion and keeping back others. And it appears from the ancient Canons that some one celebrated the Mass from whom all the other presbyters and deacons received the body of he Lord; for thus the words of the Nicene Canon say: Let the deacons, according to their order, receive the Holy Communion after the presbyters, from the bishop or from a presbyter.  And Paul, 1 Cor. 11:33, commands concerning the Communion: Tarry one for another, so that there may be a common participation.

弥撒既是施圣餐的，所以每逢圣日，我们就公行弥撒一次；在其余日子，如有人要领这圣礼，也施给凡愿意领受的人。这不是把新创的规矩引入教会。因为在格雷戈里（Gregory）之先，没有人说到私行弥撒，只多说到公行弥撒。屈梭多模说：“教牧每日站在圣坛前，叫有些人领圣餐，又不允有些人领受。”照古时的教条，某人施行弥撒时，明明有其他长老执事从他领受主的身体。因为尼西亚教条如此说：“执事应依次在长老之后从监督或长老领受圣餐。”保罗论圣餐，林前11：33吩咐说：“要彼此等待”，为的大众可以同领。
［圣餐］

Forasmuch, therefore, as the Mass with us has the example of the Church, taken from the Scripture and the Fathers, we are confident that it cannot be disapproved, especially since public ceremonies, for the most part like those hither to in use, are retained; only the number of Masses differs, which, because of very great and manifest abuses doubtless might be profitably reduced.  For in olden times, even in churches most frequented, the Mass was not celebrated every day, as the Tripartite History (Book 9, chap. 33) testifies: Again in Alexandria, every Wednesday and Friday the Scriptures are read, and the doctors expound them, and all things are done, except the solemn rite of Communion.

这样，我们所行的弥撒既合乎由圣经与古教父著作而来的教会的成规，我们相信这没有人能反对；特别是我们公用的仪式既大半与常用的仪式相同，只有弥撒的次数不同，因为既有很大而明显的弊端，不如减少些为善。因为在古时，就是人数最多的教会，也没有每日行弥撒的规矩；三部史卷九，第三十三章作见证说：“再有亚力山太的教会，每逢礼拜四，礼拜六，读圣经，由博士讲解，并行其余的事，只是不举行圣餐。”

Once again, we see in this article of faith that the Lutheran forefathers desire was to continue – not to reject – the wholesome, beneficial, and historic worship practices of the Church. Lutheranism retained the traditional form of the Mass, that is, the service of Holy Communion. In many respects, the ceremonies and liturgy of the Lutheran Church were very similar to those of the Roman Church. The difference lay in Lutheranism’s rejection of false teaching that crept into the Mass: that somehow, and without faith, simply by attending and observing the spectacle of the Mass, people could merit the forgiveness of sins. Worst of all was Rome’s new teaching that a priest saying Mass is actually offering Christ in an unbloody manner to appease God and secure His favor. Masses became a source of considerable revenue for the Church, since people were encouraged to “sponsor” the saying of a Mass for their living – and dead – friends and relatives.

在本篇中我们再次看到路德宗先辈们是要继承而不是废弃教会的优良的、有益的敬拜传统。路德宗保持了弥撒的传统，也就是圣餐礼。在很多方面路德宗教会的礼仪和敬拜仪式跟罗马教会很相像。区别是路德宗抵制弥撒中错误的教导：也就是不靠信心只靠参加和观看弥撒人就可以罪得赦免。最糟的是罗马的新的教导也就是一个神父提出弥撒实际上是以一种不流血的方式献上基督的身体，以求得到上帝的满足和喜乐。弥撒也成了教会可观的收入的来源，因为他们教导人们为他们的健在的、去世的亲戚朋友来“资助”弥撒。

This reminds me of the Lord’s words in Luke 20: 45 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples, 46 “Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. 47 They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.”

这让我想起神在路加福音20章的话：45众百姓听的时候，耶稣对门徒说，46你们要防备文士。他们好穿长衣游行，喜爱人在街市上问他们安，又喜爱会堂里的高位，筵席上的首座。47他们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意作很长的祷告。这些人要受更重的刑罚。

“They devour widows’ houses.” As a parish pastor in Louisiana, I had a widow in my congregation who was married to a Roman Catholic and after he died the priest still sent requests for her dead husband’s mass, even though she wasn’t even a Catholic, putting on her conscience that this is what her purgatory-bound husband would want her to do if he were still alive! What a disgrace and mockery of the Word of God. Yes, the Roman Catholic Church still devours the houses of widows. However, the day will come when Jesus will exact punishment from them and of the sort that Jesus says, “Most severely.”

“他们侵吞寡妇的家产。“作为路易斯安那州的堂区牧师，在我教会有一个寡妇曾嫁给一个天主教徒，在丈夫去世后神父还一直要求为她的丈夫做弥撒，尽管她根本都不是天主教徒，让她觉得如果处在炼狱中的丈夫还活着的话这是他要她做的。这对神的话语是多么大的羞辱和嘲弄。是的，罗马天主教还在侵吞寡妇的家产。但是有一天当耶稣再来的时候他们面临的刑罚将是耶稣说的“更重的”。

Never in Christ’s words of institution had he even insinuated such deplorable acts of wickedness. He gave the Church this Sacrament as a gift and blessing, to be used in faith by the people of God.

在基督的教导中找不到一丁点对这种恶行的依据。他赐个教会这个圣礼是恩赐和祝福，是要神的子民凭信心领受的。

Our Lutheran churches are falsely accused of abolishing the Mass, when in reality, we preserved it of its original intent, to feed the lambs of God as Peter was instructed to do in the last chapter of John’s gospel. Therefore, we interspersed German hymns and the Deutche Messe, (Luther’s German Mass), so that the uneducated people could learn about Christ. Not only has Paul commanded that a language understood by the people be used in church (I Cor. 14:2,9 “2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. 9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.”) This also increases the reverence and devotion of the Mass.

有人错误的指责路德宗废弃弥撒，但事实上我们继承了并使它归回起初的目的，为的是能够喂养神的羊，正如在约翰福音最后一章神要彼得所做的那样。因此我们在其中插入了德文诗歌和德意志崇拜曲，（路德德国弥撒），以便那些没有受过教育的人也能够认识基督。不仅保罗要求教会要使用众人能听懂的语言（林前14:2,9 2那说方言的，原不是对人说，乃是对神说。因为没有人听出来。然而他在心灵里，却是讲说各样的奥秘。9你们也是如此，舌头若不说容易明白的话，怎能知道所说的是什么呢。这就是向空说话了。）这也使人能够存更敬畏更忠诚的心来到神的面前。

No one is admitted to the sacrament without examining himself, according to the words of St. Paul.

根据圣徒所说的人若不省察自己就不能参加圣礼。

Corinthians 11:28, 29 Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 29 For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.

格林多前书11:28,29 人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼，喝这杯。因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。
