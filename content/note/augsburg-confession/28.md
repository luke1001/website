It is the custom of the Roman Catholic Church to withhold the cup from the laity in Holy Communion. That was an abuse which the Lutherans corrected. In the first part of the article, they establish the fact that Scriptures teach both kinds.

在罗马天主教会中普通信徒在圣餐中不能喝这杯。路德宗纠正了这一错误做法。在本篇第一部分是告诉我们圣经关于两者的教导。

To the laity are given Both Kinds in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, because this usage has the commandment of the Lord in Matt. 26:27: Drink ye all of it, where Christ has manifestly commanded concerning the cup that all should drink.  And lest any man should craftily say that this refers only to priests, Paul in 1 Cor. 11:27 recites an example from which it appears that the whole congregation did use both kinds.  

圣餐的身体和宝血两种都当分给平信徒；因这规矩乃是照着主的吩咐，太26:27：“你们都喝这个”。这里基督论这杯，明白吩咐都应当喝。没有人能争论说这是单指教牧，圣保罗在林前11:27举了一个全教会同领饼酒二种的例子。

There are thousands of different church bodys who believe differently from each other regarding the teachings of Christ. Some are closer than others to what the Bible teaches. However, there are only about 3-5 different viewpoints pertaining to the Lord’s Supper. Perhaps this is because only Matthew, Mark, and Luke and 1 Corinthians contain the words of institution for us. The words are clear. The only biblical thing to do is to believe them and accept by faith what they say. Jesus leaves no room for doubt – he wants all to partake of the cup.

教会有千千万万，教会对基督的教导看见又各不相同。有些教会比其它教会更接近圣经。但关于圣餐却只有3-5种主流看法。也许这是因为只有马太福音、马可福音、路加福音和哥林多前书提到设立圣餐。这些记载都十分明确。唯一我们要做的就是靠信心相信接受圣经所说的。耶稣不容我们质疑—他要我们也领这杯。

You might recall in 1 Corinthians that Paul teaches us that the Lord’s Supper was given to the church – all believers, not to the clergy exclusively to manipulate as they see fit. Paul writes…

你可能还记得保罗在哥林多前书教导圣餐使给教会—所有信徒的，而不是专门给神职人员的，即便他们认为这是理所当然的。保罗这样写道…

1 Corinthians 11:23-26 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” 25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

哥林多前书 11:23-26 我当日传给你们的，原是从主领受的，就是主耶稣被卖的那一夜，拿起饼来， 祝谢了，就擘开，说，这是我的身体，为你们舍的（舍有古卷作擘开）。你们应当如此行，为的是记念我。饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说，这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。

1) Who did Jesus pass this precious meal on to, according to Paul?

1）据保罗记载，耶稣把圣餐传给了谁？

2) Who did Paul pass it on to?

2）保罗传给了谁？

3) How does the Church make use of this meal?

3）教会是如何利用圣餐的？

1 Timothy 5:22 Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands.

提摩太前书 5：22 给人行按手的礼，不可急促。

4) Paul, writing to a fellow pastor (Timothy) encourages him to cautiously do what? Why?

4）保罗跟一个同工牧师（提摩太）写信鼓励他要小心做什么？为什么？

#### II. The Practice of the Church 教会惯例

And this usage has long remained in the Church, nor is it known when, or by whose authority, it was changed; although Cardinal Cusanus mentions the time when it was approved. Cyprian in some places testifies that the blood was given to the people.  The same is testified by Jerome, who says: The priests administer the Eucharist, and distribute the blood of Christ to the people. Indeed, Pope Gelasius commands that the Sacrament be not divided (dist. II., De Consecratione, cap. Comperimus). Only custom, not so ancient, has it otherwise.

这规矩在教会多年存在；后来，在什么时候，凭什么权柄，改变了这规矩，都无从查考。仅红衣主教库萨努（Cusanus）说到这规矩是什么时候承认的居普良（Cyprian）在有些地方证明血也分给众人；杰罗姆（Jerome）也同样见证说：“教牧施圣餐，将基督的血分给众人。” 不但如此，教皇格拉修（Gelasius）吩咐圣礼不可分开（Dist. 2, De Consecratione, Cap. Comperimus）。惟有一个不最近的规矩才把这圣礼分开。

Notes: 

注：

Two witnesses are called up from the early church: Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who died in A.D. 258, and Jerome, who spent the most important years of his life in Bethlehem and gave to the church a Latin translation of the Bible, the so-called Vulgate. He died in 420. Besides these two witnesses, we might mention the Didache, the “Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles.” This is a book which was widely used in the early church but then was lost for more than 1,500 years, till a copy was discovered in 1883 in Constantinople. This little book, of barely 11 ordinary pages, was written between A.D. 80 and 120. It devotes two chapters, two pages, to instructions concerning the proper celebration of the Lord’s Supper. It contains prayers that were used in the consecration of the elements, offering a separate prayer for the cup as well as one for the bread, and lists a lengthy prayer to be said after the Meal. It orders that only such as have been baptized shall be admitted to eat or drink of the Supper.

在早期教会有两位证人：塞浦路斯，迦太基的主教，死于公元258年，和杰罗姆，他一生最重要的时光是在伯利恒度过的并且给教会留下了圣经的拉丁文翻译，也就是所谓的拉丁文圣经。他死于420年。除了这两个见证人之外我们还要提到《十二使徒遗训》。这是一本在早期教会广泛使用的书，但随后却销声匿迹长达1500年之久，直到1883年在君士坦丁堡发现一本。这本小册子只有普通的11页，它写于公元80到120年之间。这本书用两章整整两页来写如何正确领受圣餐。这包括一个为圣餐各个部分分别为圣的祷告，为饼和杯单独献上祷告，还罗列了一个圣餐礼后的一个长祷告。它要求只有受过洗的人才能来领饼和杯。

From later years Pope Gelasius is quoted. He was bishop of Rome from 492 to 496. We may also mention Pope Paschalis II, who died in 1118. He, too, protested against the withholding of the cup from the laity.

再晚些时候教皇格拉西被引用。492到496年间他是罗马主教。我们还要提到教皇帕斯卡利斯二世，死于1118年，他也反对普通信徒不能领受这杯。

#### III. Offense to Conscience 违背良心

But it is evident that any custom introduced against the commandments of God is not to be allowed, as the Canons witness (dist. III., cap. Veritate, and the following chapters).  But this custom has been received, not only against the Scripture, but also against the old Canons and the example of the Church. Therefore, if any preferred to use both kinds of the Sacrament, they ought not to have been compelled with offense to their consciences to do otherwise. And because the division of the Sacrament does not agree with the ordinance of Christ, we are accustomed to omit the procession, which hitherto has been in use.

但照教条所见证的（见Dist. 8, Cap. Veritate和以下的话），凡违反上帝命令的规矩，显然是不应当承认的。这样，接受这规矩不独违反圣经，而且也不合古时的教条和教会的成例。因此人若情愿领圣礼的体血两样，就不可强迫他们不这样行，以致使他们良心不安。再说，分领圣礼既然不合基督设立圣礼的本意，照我们教会的规矩应该将他们现在所行的忽略。

Christ provided a means by which his children can be edified and strengthened in their faith. For anyone to withhold this precious means of grace from God’s people, they are committing a grievous sin against God.

基督预备了一种可以叫儿女在信心上得启示和得坚固的途径。任何扣留这种恩典途径不给神的子民的人的罪是巨大的。

Closely related to the error of one form only is what Catholics call procession. The bread is changed into the body of Christ; where the body is, there is also the blood. Therefore, the wafer has been turned into the person of Christ. Hence Christian ought to pray before and to the consecrated wafer. Pope Honorius III (1216-1227) was the first to order this, and Pope Urban IV in 1264 instituted the special festival of Corpus Christi. This abuse, bordering on idolatry, is plainly contrary to the words of institution, which direct us to eat and drink. This is another grave offense to consciences.

跟这种圣餐单一形式息息相关的是天主教所教导的化质说。饼变成了基督的身体；既然是身体，里面就有血。因此饼就变成了基督自己。因此基督徒应该事先为饼做分别为圣的祷告。教皇何诺三世（1216-1227）是第一个提出此说的人，教皇乌尔班四世在1264年设立了圣体节。这种滥用接近拜偶像，是跟设立圣餐的经文相抵触的，经文是要我们去吃和喝。这是另外一个违背良心的地方。
