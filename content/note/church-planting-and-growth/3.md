A. As we learned in the last lesson, the invisible church (or Church) consists of all those in earth and heaven who trust in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. Through faith they have eternal life.

从上一课，我们知道那无形的教会（或那基督的教会）是由所有在天上和地上倚靠耶稣赦罪的人所组成的，他们凭信心得到永生。

B. However, since only God can read hearts to see who is truly a believer or unbeliever (a member of the one true Church), we now see only visible churches; we see many who profess to believe in Christ and belong to visible, outward organizations (denominations, synods, etc). Though we use the word "church" when talking about these outward structures and gatherings of people (cf. Paul's intros to his epistles), we must always remember there is a difference between these two concepts, that is, between visible churches and the invisible church.

然而，正因为只有上帝才能够洞悉人心，知道哪些人是真正的信徒与否（那真正教会的一份子），我们现在见到的只是有形的教会，见到很多的人宣称相信基督并属于各个有形的、外在的组织（宗派、宗会等等）。纵使我们常常用「教会」来表示这些外在的组织和聚在一起的人们（如保罗用在他的书信开端），我们要紧记这两个概念之间是有分别的，就是外在可见的教会跟无形不可见的教会之区别。

C. The question naturally arises, "If the true Church is invisible, how can a person find it and belong to it?" God has not left us without guidance. A person can find the true Church by looking for the marks of the church. These marks enable us to find the true Church of Christ.

这很自然地引发另一问题：「如果那真正的教会是看不见的，那么一个人怎样可以找到她，继而属于她呢？」上帝不是没有留给我们指引的。任何人都可以借着寻找教会的记号，找到那真正的教会。这些记号帮助我们找寻真正属于基督的教会。

D. Think of it this way. The wind is invisible, and yet we can see the effects of the wind -- leaves rustling, sound of rushing wind, feel it blow through our hair. When we observe these things, we conclude that the wind must be there. (Read John 3:5-8).

我们可以这样想：风是无形的，但我们却可以见到风造成的效果，如树叶发出的沙沙声和疾风的飕飕声，我们的头发给风吹起等。当我们观察到这一切时，我们得出结论，就是风必定在当中。（参阅 约 3：5－8）

E. So also God has given us marks by which we can find the true Church and conclude that there are members of it in that place. We can find the true Church wherever the gospel is correctly taught according to the Word, and where the sacraments are administered (used) in the way Christ appointed them to be used.

同样，上帝给我们一些形迹记号，依这些记号我们可以找到那真正的教会，并且清楚知道有其成员在当中。在任何地方只要福音是按照上帝的话语正确地教导，圣礼是依基督的话而行，我们就可以找到那真正的教会。

F. The Holy Spirit works through the means of grace, which is the gospel in Word and sacrament. Only the gospel can bring people to faith in Christ and keep them in faith. (Ro. 1:17-18)

圣灵借着恩典的媒介工作，就是借着在道和圣礼中的福音。唯独是福音能够引领人相信基督和保守他们的信心（罗 1：17-18）。

G. The Word of God has to power to create faith. Ro. 10:17 says "Faith comes by hearing the message…" The Word of God also has the power to sustain faith. In John 8:31-32 Jesus says, "If you continue in my teaching, you are truly my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." See also 2 Peter 3:18, Eph.6.

上帝的道有创造信心的能力。罗马书10：17说：「可见信道是从听道来的……」上帝的道也能够维持信心。在约翰福音 8：31－32耶稣说：「你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒； 你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自由。」也可参考 彼后 3：18、弗 6章。

H. In addition to his Word, Christ has also given two sacraments to his Church. A sacrament is a sacred act, given by Christ himself to his Church, which offers, gives, and seals to us the forgiveness of sins. The two sacraments are baptism and the Lord's Supper. Both the Lord's Supper and baptism offer, give, and seal to us the forgiveness of sins (1 Co.11, Titus 3). The message of the gospel is the message of the forgiveness of sins.

除了祂的道，基督还赐了两项圣礼给祂的教会。圣礼是基督亲自赐给祂的教会的，是神圣的行为。圣礼供给并且赐予宽恕，更印记我们的罪得赦免。这两项圣礼就是洗礼和圣餐礼，它们都供给、赐予宽恕并作我们赦罪的印记（林前 11章、多 3章）。福音的信息就是赦罪的信息。

I. There are differences between baptism and the Lord's Supper. Each uses a different earthly element (water, bread, wine). Scripture indicates that baptism can both create and strengthen faith, while the Lord's Supper is Christ's gift to mature Christians, in which he gives the forgiveness of sins and strengthens faith.

洗礼与圣餐礼之间有着一定的分别。各用到地上不同的东西（水、饼、葡萄酒）。圣经指出洗礼可以产生并加强信心，而圣餐礼就是基督给成熟的基督徒的恩赐，在圣餐礼基督赦免他们的罪及使信心坚固。

J. Although we cannot look into a person's heart to see what he / she truly believes, nonetheless we have the confidence that wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments properly administered, there also the Holy Spirit will be at work, bringing people to faith and producing fruits of faith in their lives.

虽然我们不可以知道人们的心真正信甚么，但我们可以肯定的就是当福音得宣讲和圣礼恰当地施行时，圣灵必定在工作，领人归信，使人生命结果子。

K. The gospel ministry is essentially the same thing as the ministry of the keys which Christ has given to all believers. It is the right and responsibility to preach the law and the gospel to all people for the salvation of souls.

福音的事工相等于基督交托给所有信徒的钥匙职。向所有人宣讲律法和福音，为着灵魂得到救赎，这是所有信徒的权利和责任。

L. Since the gospel is often proclaimed in many Christian churches of various denominations (Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, etc), we also believe that there are members of the one true invisible Church in the various visible Christian churches. The invisible Church cannot be identified with any one visible church (synod, denomination). Every visible church is a collection of true believers and hypocrites.

因福音常常在众多不同宗派（浸信会、循道卫理会、圣公会、长老会等）的基督教教会内宣扬，所以我们相信在不同的有形教会中，有那唯一真正无形教会的成员存在。那无形的教会不可以等同为任何一间有形的教会（宗会或宗派）。每一间有形的教会都是一个包括真信徒和假冒为善者的群体。

M. However, since we cannot read hearts to see what people truly believe, we must rely on the public confession of a church body to see what they teach. We assume that members of a given visible church body agree with the written confession of that visible church.

但因我们无法明了人们的心真正信甚么，我们必须倚靠教会的集体公开认信，来看清楚他们教导的是甚么。我们假设那些有形教会的成员同意该教会在文字上写明他们所认信的。

N. A public confession is any statement of belief confessed in a public way. Examples: church membership, catechisms, doctrinal statements, textbooks for seminaries, periodical articles, Sunday School material, hymnals, sermons, etc.

公开认信是任何在信仰上公开宣认的声明。例如：教会会藉、教义问答教本、教义声明、神学院的课本、期刊文章、主日学教材、圣诗、讲章等等。

O. Since the practice of church fellowship is an outward, visible thing, our practice of fellowship with other visible churches is based upon such visible, public confessions. We do not deny that there are true members of the one true Church in other visible Christian churches; we rejoice in that fact and confess it in our creeds. However, the public display of unity is based upon public agreement on the teachings of Scripture.

由于教会之间的交往合作是外在的、可见的，因此我们跟其他教会的交往合作是基于这些可见的、公开的认信。我们不否认在其他有形的教会中有那唯一真正教会的成员；我们因此感到恩喜快乐，也在我们的信条中清楚表明。然而，公开宣示合一是要建基于对圣经教导有公开的共识。

P. Jesus own command is that we "teach everything I have commanded you" (Mt.28:20). We are not at liberty to ignore or change any teaching of Scripture (Rev.22:18-19). Scripture warns that false doctrine is never neutral, but always works for the destruction of faith (2 Pe. 3:16).

耶稣的诫命就是「凡祂所吩咐我们的，都要教训他们遵守（太 28：20）。」我们没有忽视或删改任何经文教导的自由（启22：18－19）。经上警告我们，假教义从不是中性的，而必定是在于摧毁信心（彼后 3：16）。

Q. Think of it this way. False doctrine is like laying a sidewalk of cement over grass. Can grass grow up between the cracks? Yes, and often it does. However, grass grows best in dirt. While there are members of Christ's true Church in the various Christian denominations, because of the presence of false doctrine (cement), their faith grows in a hostile environment, and is not fed as fully as the Lord wishes. (See Psalm 23)

我们可以这样理解：假教义就像在草皮上铺上一条水泥路一样。草可以在罅缝中生长吗？是可以的，往往也是如此，但草仍然最适合在粪土中生长。纵使在不同基督教宗派中有属于那真正基督的教会的成员，但是由于当中有假教义（水泥），他们的信心只能在严苛的环境中成长，并不如上帝希望般得到喂养。（诗 23）

R. This is one of the reasons we separate from other visible churches. We wish to feed the souls in our care the pure Word of God and true sacraments so that they grow in their faith. Separation quarantines the flock from the deadly spread of false doctrine. (Ro.16:17)

这是其中一个我们跟其他有形的教会分开的原因。我们希望在我们的照料下把纯正上帝的道和真正的圣礼喂养给灵魂，使他们信心能成长起来。这样的分离可以把羊群分隔出来，免受致命的假教义侵害。（罗 16：17）

S. The other reason we separate from other visible churches is for Christian love's sake. In this case, Christian love takes the form of pointing out error. We separate as a visible warning that they have wandered from the truth of Scripture, and need to repent. (James 5:20, Ezekiel 3).

我们跟其他有形的教会分开的另外一个原因，是为了基督徒间爱的缘故。在此，基督徒的爱是以指出错误的方式表达出来。我们跟他们分开，是作为他们离开圣经真理的可见警告，让他们知道需要悔改（雅 5：20，结 3章）。
