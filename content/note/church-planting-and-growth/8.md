Evaluate the following:

就以下不同的说话，给予评价：

After sharing the gospel with an unbeliever, a Christian evangelist says, "You need to pray right now to God for him to send the Holy Spirit into your heart. Then you will be saved!"

一位基督教传道人在跟一位非信徒分享福音后说：「你需要立刻祷告上帝，求祂差圣灵进入你的心。这样你就得救！」

The goal of a pastor in a cross-cultural ministry should be to eventually get his congregation to use the same worship style / hymnbook as the rest of the synod, so as a spiritual family we can have all things in common.

在跨文化事工中，牧师的目标应该是最终使到他的会众使用跟教区内其他会众相同的崇拜形式／圣诗集，以致作为一个属灵的家能够做到所有的东西都是共同一致的。

Since the Word is sufficient and powerful, the best way to begin a new mission is simply to find a place to worship and begin to preach and teach on Sundays.

因着上帝的道是足够且大能的，最好的开展新事工的方法便是找到一个能敬拜的地方，并开始在主日讲道和教导。
