A. The business of the Church is to preach Christ crucified for the salvation of souls. All things done in the name of Christ must focus on this mission. For Jesus himself said, "What good is it if a man gains the whole world and loses his own soul? And what will a man give in exchange for his soul? (Mark 8:36-37)"

基督的教会的工作，就是宣讲基督为了救赎灵魂而被钉死的信息。所有奉基督的名而作的事，必须朝向这个使命。因耶稣亲自说：「人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢﹖人还能拿什么换生命呢？」（可 8：36-37）

B. The main tools God has given us to accomplish this mission of saving souls is the Word and sacraments. Concerning the Word of God we wish to note a few things:

为了成就拯救灵魂的使命，上帝赐给我们的主要工具有圣礼和祂的道。有关上帝的道，我们需要留意几点：

C. God's Word is sufficient. Read "The Rich Man and Lazarus" in Luke 16:19-31. This means that while the Word of God does not tell us everything we may wish to know, it does tell us everything we need to know in order to be saved. In fact, the Word of God is the only place where we can learn how we are saved.

上帝的道是足够的。细心阅读在路加福音16：19－31节的「财主与拉撒路」。意思就是，纵使上帝的道没有将所有我们渴望知道的东西都告诉我们，但是它在我们救赎的事上，把所有我们需要知道的都告诉我们。事实上，我们亦只有在上帝的道，才得知我们如何可以得救。

D. God's Word is efficacious. Read 2 Timothy 3:15 and Isaiah 55:6-13. This means that Scripture alone has the power to work faith in the unbeliever, and also sanctification in the Christian.

上帝的道是有功效的。细心阅读提摩太后书3章15节及以赛亚书55章6－13节。意思是圣经本身就有能力作工，使非信徒生出信心来，也可以使基督徒成圣。

E. As mentioned before, the real mission and goal of the Church is to bring all people into Christ's invisible kingdom of faith through the preaching of the word, and not merely to get them to join a local, visible congregation of believers. Membership in a visible congregation is not equal to saving faith.

如以前提过，基督的教会的真正使命和目标是透过宣讲上帝的道，带所有的人进入那基督的无形信心国度，而不只是叫他们加入任何本地可见的信徒群体。一个看得见的教会会籍并不等如能使人得救的信心。

F. Since the 1950's there has been a movement inside visible Christian churches call the Church Growth Movement. The movement started out of frustration and concern over an apparent lack of visible growth of the Christian church in the world. The basic sentiment expressed was, "Surely God wants the Church to grow! How can we make the Church grow?"

自1950年代，在可见的教会中发起了一项运动，名为教会增长运动。运动的起因是由于人们关心到世界各地的基督教教会都缺乏可见的增长而感受挫折。他们本着的观点是：「上帝当然要基督的教会增长！既然这样我们怎样可以使到教会增长呢？」

G. The preoccupation, however, of this movement has been the visible, numerical growth of visible churches. Programs, plans, and strategies have been developed and perfected to bring people into a visible Christian congregation.

然而，这个运动所忧虑到的是有形教会在人数上的可见增长。各式各样的活动、计划和策略得到发展和完善起来，务求将人群带到有形的会众中。

H. The fundamental flaw of the Church Growth Movement is that conversion is viewed as a work of man (human decision, choice) and not the work of God alone. Consequently, great emphasis is placed upon using "human" tools to bring people into the church ("felt needs", statistics, polls, sociologists, etc.).

教会增长运动犯了根本上的错误，就是把悔改归主视为人作的工（人的决策、选择），而不是全属上帝的工作。这样的看法，导致重点放了在使用「人」的工具上（「感受到的需要」、统计、意见调查、社会学家分析等），为求将人群带到教会去。

I. What is our response to this approach? We are talking about methodology, that is, using certain human means, tools, and methods to share the gospel. First, we need to understand that God's Word encourages us to use all our talents in our efforts to preach the gospel. The fact that the tool we use is the powerful Word is in no way an excuse for inactivity. In fact, God rebukes congregations for such lack of loving activity (Rev.3:14 ff).

我们对这手法有甚么响应呢？我们讨论的是方法，就是用某种人为的途径、工具、方法来分享福音。首先，我们需要明白上帝的话语鼓励我们以我们的努力，加上我们所有的才干去宣扬福音。纵然我们所用的工具是上帝满有大能的道，我们并没有以此为变得怠惰的借口。反之，上帝责备如此缺乏相爱行动的教会（启3：14 起）。

J. The mission activity of the Church will include planning. God himself planned our salvation, and followed through on his plan in an orderly way. Likewise, Jesus sent out the Twelve with a plan to go only to the lost sheep of Israel (Mt.10:1-6), and the Apostle Paul planned out his missionary trips according to Christian freedom and God-given reason. Planning is not wrong, nor is planning, properly done, telling God what to do.

基督的教会在使命行动上也包括筹划。上帝亲自计划好我们的救恩，并一步一步有条理的实践祂的计划。同样，耶稣差派十二门徒去只寻找以色列中失落的羊（太 10：1－6），而使徒保罗就依据基督徒的自由及本着上帝的缘故计划出他的传道旅程。计划没有错，好好的计划，让上帝知道我们会怎样做，这也没有错。

K. Similarly, the setting of goals is not Biblically wrong. Read Romans 15:20-25. Note how Paul both planned and set goals for himself in his ministry.

同样，订立目标从圣经的角度看也没有错。试阅罗马书 15：20－25，留意保罗怎样计划并为自己订立传道目标。

L. Methods are adiaphora (matter of Christian freedom) as long as they do not contradict the clear Word of God. However, care must be taken that we use all methods properly. God has given us certain responsibilities, but has reserved certain spheres of activity for himself.

方法是中立物（基督徒可以自由选择），只要方法不违背上帝清晰明确的说话。但我们使用任何的方法时，也要确保运用得适当正确。上帝赋予我们一些责任，但也保留一些工作在祂自己的范围内。

M. We need to be aware of certain dangers in light of the Church Growth Movement. (1) We must always strive to never give the impression that we are "manipulating" people into joining our church, so that the name of our Savior isn't tarnished. (2) We need to realize that true growth of the Kingdom is God's responsibility alone. The result of failing to reach our own projected / expected goals from our own well-defined plans can result in conflict and frustration within the visible congregation. (3) A loss of proper focus may result in a very large, very active congregation full of immature Christians who are not progressing in their faith (cmp. 1 Cor. 3:10-15).

有鉴于教会增长运动的兴起，我们也要小心当中的危机。（1）我们必须竭力避免给人一种印象，就是我们在「操控」人们加入我们的教会，以免我们救主的名受玷污。（2）我们要清楚明白天国的真正扩张，是完完全全属于上帝的责任。当我们的周详计划中的预期目标最后达不到时，可能引致教会会众感到沮丧，产生纷争。（3）失去了适当的焦点，教会会众人数可能多了很多，会众可能变得很活跃，但教会却满是信心欠成长的基督徒（比较 林前 3：10－15）。

N. Today's messengers of Christ have, in essence, but one duty, to faithfully sow the seed of the Word. We do this realizing that we live in the Last Days, when Jesus said there will be an increase in wickedness, and when the love of most will grow cold (Mt. 24). We fully realize that less, not more, will listen to the Word of the Lord before the end.

今天作为传达基督佳音的人，精要一点来说只有一个任务，就是忠心的撒播道的种子。我们作工的同时，也明了我们活在世界末了的日子。耶稣说，在这时候世上不法的事增多，许多人的爱心渐渐冷淡（太 24章）。我们充份了解在这日子，越来越少的人会愿意听主的道。

O. Likewise, we put ourselves at the Lord's disposal to be used by him as he sees fit. If he places us in an area and blesses the preaching of his Word with visible growth, this is to his glory, not ours. However, like Jeremiah we may be called to preach in a place as a testimony against them, and our message will be met largely with rejection. Though this saddens us, we ultimately realize that this is to God's glory as well; we have faithfully done with a clear conscience what he asked of us.

同样，我们随时准备好自己，任由主按自己的意思使用我们。若果上帝把我们带到一个地方，并以可见的增长来祝福布道的工作，这不是我们的荣耀，而是祂的。然而，像耶利米般，我们可能被召到一个地方作见证，指出他们的不是，在大多数情况下我们讲的话将会被拒绝。虽然这样会使我们的心沉重起来，但是我们最终会明白这也是为了上帝的荣耀，因为我们已经怀着一伙清心，信守完成祂交托给我们的工作。

P. Our attitude is that of St. Paul who wrote " What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow." (1 Co. 3:5-7)

我们的态度就是像圣保罗所写的：「亚波罗算什么﹖保罗算什么﹖无非是执事，照主所赐给他们各人的，引导你们相信。 我栽种了，亚波罗浇灌了，惟有上帝叫他生长。 可见栽种的，算不得什么，浇灌的，也算不得什么；只在那叫他生长的上帝。」（林前 3：5－7）

Q. Read 2 Timothy 4:1-5. Our Lord's charge to us remains ever the same, and the tools he has placed in our hands remain as powerful as ever.

阅读 提摩太后书 4：1－5。主对我们的嘱咐恒久不变，而祂赐给我们手上的工具也是持久大有功效的。
