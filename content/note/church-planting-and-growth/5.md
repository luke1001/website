Thesis Three: The mission that Christ has given to his church is to preach the gospel to the entire world (Mt. 28:18-20).

论题 3：基督交托祂教会的使命就是向全球世人宣讲福音（太 28：18-20）。

Key Terms 重要词汇：

Universal justification 普世称义

Outreach 外展

Nurture 栽培

Proselytizing 使人改宗

A. Read Matthew 28:16-20. This is known as the Great Commission. We wish to note a number of things about this passage.

细阅 马太福音 28：16－20。这个就是所谓的大使命。我们要注意这经文中的几个要点

B. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me…" This was especially shown in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Although Jesus, as true God, always had all authority and power, his exaltation following his death means that he once again took up full use of his power, after willingly setting it aside for a while (Php. 2:5-11)

「天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了……」这一点特别在耶稣从死里复活中显明出来。虽然耶稣作为真神，一直拥有所有权柄和能力，祂在胜过死亡后被高举，表明了祂早前甘愿暂时舍弃的大能，如今又重新掌握（腓 2：5－11）。

C. "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations…" The word "disciple" in Greek literally means "learner, student." Here the expression means that we are to actively seek the conversion to faith in Christ of every soul on the planet.

「所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒……」「门徒」在希腊原文的字面意思是「学生」。这一句话的意思是我们要主动的寻求地上每一个灵魂都归信基督。

D. The basis for our preaching is the universal justification of the world through Christ. In short, we are to preach to every person under heaven because Christ died for the sins of all (cf. 1 John 2:2). Read Luke 24:45-49. To proclaim "repentance for the forgiveness of sins" is to proclaim the message of the gospel, namely, that Christ has forgiven the sins of the world.

我们所宣讲的是建基于世人藉基督而得的「普世称义」。简单来说，我们要向所有普天下的人传讲，皆因基督是为所有人的罪而死的（参 约一 2：2）。参阅 路加福音 24：45－49。 宣扬「悔改求赦罪」是宣扬福音的信息，就是基督已宽恕世人的罪。

E. In this respect, Lutheranism has a truly powerful message to proclaim to the world. It also is rapidly becoming a unique message in the world. While many denominations run around asking, "Are you saved?", the Lutheran evangelist will go around proclaiming, "You are forgiven!" To preach the gospel means to proclaim to the world what God has done for us in Christ.

在这方面，路德会有一个真正有力的信息向世界宣讲，亦是迅速的成为世上独一的信息。正当其他的宗派到处问：「你是否得救？」，路德会的宣教士就到处宣扬：「你已经得赦免」。宣讲福音就是宣讲上帝在基督里为我们成就了甚么。

F. "Baptizing them …" This is one way to make disciples. Baptism makes infants and young children Jesus' disciples. Baptism of adults confirms their status as disciples of Jesus, and works for the strengthening of their faith.

「给他们施洗……」这是使人成为门徒的一个方法。洗礼使婴孩成为耶稣的门徒，而成年人的洗礼则确认他们的耶稣门徒身分，坚固他们的信心。

G. "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…" As God explained to Moses (Ex.33-34), God's name is everything he reveals about himself in his Word. This includes the revelation that God is holy and just, the One who punishes sin. But, more importantly, this also includes the revelation that the holy God is also the Savior of all mankind. Baptism in the name of the triune God is pure gospel, connecting us to the Savior God.

「奉父、子、圣灵的名……」如上帝向摩西指出（出 33－34章），上帝的名就是祂在话语里所有启示自己的一切，这包括祂是圣洁的、公义的以及祂就是那位惩处罪的。但更重要的是，这包括了一个启示，就是圣洁的上帝也是全人类的救主。奉三位一体的上帝受洗是纯正的福音，把我们跟救主上帝连系一起。

H. "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." As Paul explains in Ephesians 4, God's will is that we grow up in our salvation and "reach maturity." Maturity is reached by teaching everything God has revealed in his Word.

「凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守……」像保罗在以弗所书第四章解释，上帝的旨意就是我们在救恩中成长并「达到成熟」。教导所有上帝在祂的道里启示的，就能达到成熟。

I. "And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." Jesus remains Immanuel ("God with us") forever. Since he rose from the dead and lives forever, he is always there to give us strength to fulfill his mission for us, and bless the results of our work in his name.

「……我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。」耶稣仍旧以马内利（「上帝与我们同在」）直到永远。因祂已从死里复活并且永远活着，祂就会无时无刻的赐力量给我们，来完成祂交托我们的使命，祝福我们奉祂名而作的工。

J. Outreach refers to our fulfilling of the Church's mission by preaching the gospel to those who do not yet know it. It is also sometimes called evangelism or witnessing.

外展是指我们达成教会的使命，向还未认识福音的人宣讲福音，这也称为传福音或作见证。

K. Since Christ has told us to preach to all nations, outreach is cross-cultural. The true Church has members in it from every language, race, tribe, and people under heaven (Rev.7:9). God has given us the command to preach, not convert -- which is God's work alone. Part of our outreach efforts will undoubtedly include prayers for the conversion of all people.

因基督吩咐我们向万国宣讲福音，所以外展是跨文化的工作。那真正属基督的教会，其会众来自普天下各民各族各语言（启 7：9）。上帝吩咐我们去宣讲，而不是使人悔改归主，皆因这完全是上帝的工。为所有人悔改归主而祷告，当然是我们外展工作的一部份。

L. Nurture refers to the other part of the Church's mission. Nurture is the ongoing mission to build Christians up in the faith through preaching and teaching of the Word, and through the administration of the sacraments. The Holy Spirit promises to work through these means of grace to keep Christians in the one true faith following their conversion. It is God's will that Christians are always striving to learn more and more of the Word, and in this way reach maturity in faith (Eph.4; 2 Pe. 3:18; John 15:5).

栽培是指教会使命的另一部份，也是持续的使命，让基督徒从上帝话语的宣讲及教导中，从圣礼的施行中，信心得到建立。圣灵应许在人悔改归主成为基督徒后，透过这些恩典的媒介作工，保守他们那唯一真正的信心。上帝的心意是叫基督徒努力学习更多的道，从而在信心方面成熟起来（弗 4章，彼后 3：18，约 15：5）。

M. Nurture and outreach go hand in hand. The goal of outreach is nurture. In other words, we reach out with the gospel so that all people may know Jesus as Savior, and begin a life of growing in grace.

栽培与外展是分不开的，外展的目的就是栽培。换句话说，我们将福音带到人群中，是要让他们认识耶稣为救主，开展在恩典中成长的生命。

N. Likewise, nurture both equips and fuels outreach. In our outreach efforts we will run across those who have fallen prey to false teachings. Having been nurtured, Christians are in a position to recognize error and more clearly explain what the Bible teaches. Also, the more we grow in grace through the Word and sacrament the more we will be empowered and inspired to share the gospel with all.

同样，栽培既为外展作准备亦是外展工作的动力。在外展中，我们会遇到那些已经成为假教义猎物的人。有了适当的栽培后，基督徒就担当察觉谬误的角色，并且更清晰地解释圣经上的教导。此外，当我们透过上帝的道和圣礼中的恩典更进一步成长时，我们将更加得力，更受圣灵感动，跟人们分享福音。

O. A natural question that arises is, "How do we view members of other Christian churches where we know false doctrine is being taught? Are they mission prospects?" Proselytizing refers to the practice of evangelizing members of other churches in an effort to get them to leave their present church and join ours. We do not practice proselytizing. Otherwise we could easily give the unscriptural impression that only members of our visible church body will be saved. However, situations will always arise when we have the opportunity to witness to other Christians (visitors, Vacation Bible School, community events, etc) In determining what to do, it will be helpful to note there is a distinction between testifying to the truth and proselytizing. St. Peter says we are to always be prepared to give an answer to the reason for the hope within us (1 Pe.3:15). Our goal in testifying to the truth is that we are seeking to extend the one, true, invisible Church, and not merely to increase the size of our visible congregation.

这样，很自然的引伸到另外一个问题，就是在哪些教授假教义的教会中的会众，我们应该怎样看待他们呢？他们是否使命的对象呢？使人改宗是指向其他教会的会众宣教，尝试使他们离开原有教会转到自己教会的做法。我们不这样做，否则我们会给其他人一种不合乎圣经教导的印象，就是说只有属于我们可见教会的会众才能得救。然而，我们会遇到向其他基督徒（如访客、暑期圣经学校、小区活动等）作见证的情况。要知道我们该怎样做，我们需要知道为真理作见证和使人改宗之间的分别。圣彼得提到我们要随时准备好，向人回答我们心中盼望的缘由（彼前 3：15）。我们为真理作见证的目的是寻求那唯一的、真正的、不可见的教会得到扩张，而不只是使我们可见的会众人数增多。

P. In all situations we express the same attitude as St. Paul: "But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.(Php. 1:18) ."

在任何前方情况下，我们抱的态度就像圣保罗，说：「这有何妨呢﹖或是假意，或是真心，无论怎样，基督究竟被传开了。为此，我就欢喜，并且还要欢喜。」 （腓 1：18）
