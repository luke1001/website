Thesis Five: The mission of the Church has been entrusted to every Christian, and thus, in one sense, every Christian is a minister.

论题 5：基督的教会的使命已交托给每一个基督徒，所以从某个角度来看，每一个基督徒都是侍奉者。

Key Terms 
重要词汇：
One ministry of the gospel 福音的单一事工

Evangelism 宣教

Nurture 栽培

Ministry of the Keys 钥匙职

Universal Priesthood 普世祭司职

Personal ministry 个人侍奉

A. Our Lord Jesus Christ himself established the ministry so that the means of grace would be used to accomplish the mission of the Church (Mt. 28:19 ff; Mark 16:15 ff; Luke 24:47 ff; John 20:21 ff)

我们的主耶稣基督亲自建立了事工，让祂的教会借着恩典的媒介，来完成教会使命（太28：19，可16：15起，路24：47起，约20：21起）。

B. The ministry established by Christ is called the ministry of the gospel. The WELS in its Theses on Church and Ministry (1969) states it this way: "Christ instituted one office in his Church, the ministry of the gospel."

基督建立的事工称为福音事工。威斯康辛路德福音会在「论教会与事工」（1969）是这样说的：「基督在祂的教会设立了一个职务，就是福音事工。」

C. The WELS Theses continue by saying, "The purpose of this [one] ministry is the edification of the Church, by winning ever further sinners for Christ (evangelism), and by building up those who are already members in Christian faith and life (nurture).

接着继续讲到：「这一事工的目的是在于借着为基督赢取更多的罪人（宣教），和帮助已信主的建立起来（栽培），使教会得到造就。」

D. In its essential form, the ministry of the gospel is the same thing as the ministry of the keys. Jesus gave to individual believers and to his entire Church the right and responsibility to forgive and retain sins. This is nothing more than the proclamation of the message of God's law and gospel to all for the salvation of every person in the world (personal ministry). Read Matt. 16:16-19 and John 20:21-23.

从根本上来看，福音事工跟钥匙职是同一回事。耶稣赐给每一个信徒和祂的整个教会赦罪与定罪的权责。这正是指宣告上帝律法和福音作为世上各人赖以得救的信息（个人侍奉）。参阅 太16：16－19与 约20：21－23。

E. Scripture teaches that all Christians are equal before God; no one is superior or inferior to another Christian. Likewise, since all Christians are equal, every Christian has been entrusted with the mission of the Church, that is, the one gospel ministry.

圣经教导我们，所有的基督徒在上帝面前都是平等的，没有一个基督徒较优越或者及不上其他。正因为这样，每个基督徒都肩负着教会的使命，就是那福音的单一事工。

F. This teaching of Scripture is sometimes called the universal priesthood of all believers. In Old Testament times the priests (Levites) were separated in a special way from the other Israelites for special service to God. For example, the Levites owned no land, were consecrated into service through ritual, alone could enter the Tabernacle or Temple, and, in general, represented the Israelite people to God.

有些称这圣经教导为所有信徒的普世祭司职。在旧约时代，祭司(利未人)是从以色列民中，特别被拣选出来事奉上帝。好像他们没有自己拥有的土地，在仪式侍奉上奉献自己，唯有他们可以进入圣幕和圣殿，而且在上帝面前代表以色列民。

G. Yet when God gave his Law to Moses on Mt. Sinai, the Lord made it clear (Ex. 19:5-6) that "our of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation." Although there was a special class of people called "priests," God also declared that each Israelite was also a "priest." As a kingdom of priests, the Israelites were set apart from the other nations for special service to God. The greatest service would be that "salvation is from the Jews" (John 4:22); God would bring the Savior of all nations from his kingdom of priests. Also, Israel served as the representatives of the world before God in the sense that God revealed his Word to them, and they, in turn, were to proclaim the name of the Lord to the ends of the earth (Ps.67:7).

但是当上帝在西奈山给摩西律法时，主清楚的说出（出 19：5－6）：「就要在万民中作属我的子民，因为全地都是我的。你们要归我作祭司的国度，为圣洁的国民。」虽然当时已有订立了祭司制度，但上帝也称每一个以色列人为「祭司」。作为祭司的国度，上帝从世上各国中拣选了以色列，特定地侍奉祂。最崇高的职分就是「救恩是从犹太人出来的」（约 4：22）；上帝会从祂的祭司之国兴起那位万国的救主。同样，因为上帝向以色列启示祂的道，他们又将主的名带到世界的地极（诗 67：7），所以从这角度看，以色列也成为世人的代表。

H. This concept of the universal priesthood continues today, in New Testament times. Read 1 Peter 2:9. Let's take a closer look at the four important phrases:

这个普世祭司职的概念延续到今天的新约时代。细心阅读 彼得前书 2：9，让我们看看其中四个重点

I. "You are a chosen people…" God said the same thing through the prophet Isaiah. (Is. 43:20). Of what does the word "chosen" remind us? It reminds us that being one of the people of God is entirely God's doing. Jesus said, "You did not choose me, but I chose you.." (John 15:16). Likewise, St. Paul wrote the Corinthians, "It is because of him [God] that you are in Christ Jesus (1 Co.1:30)." Note that the word "chosen" implies that God has some purpose in mind for us.

「惟有你们是被拣选的族类……」上帝透过先知以赛亚也说过一样的话（赛 43：20）。这拣选一词提醒我们甚么呢？它提醒我们成为上帝子民的一份子，完全是上帝的作为。耶稣说：「不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们……」（约 15：16）。同样，圣保罗写信给哥林多人说：「但你们得在基督耶稣里，是本乎神。」（林前 1：30）。要注意的是「拣选」一词包含了上帝有旨意在我们身上。

J. "You are a … royal priesthood." Here God's purpose for our lives is given. Priests, essentially, are servants in the service of God. John makes mention of that in Rev. 1:5-6: " To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen." The imagery of "priest" is found throughout Revelation (e.g. Rev.11:1-2). Likewise, to comfort the churches of Asia Minor in the midst of persecution, John reminded them that they were "kings (i.e. "royal") and priests." Through Christ we are already co-reigning with him in his kingdom (Rev.20:4), for by faith we share in his Easter victory over sin, death, and hell.

「你们……是有君尊的祭司」这里上帝给我们生命中的旨意。祭司就是侍奉上帝的仆人。约翰在启示录 1：5－6提及这点：「他爱我们，用自己的血使我们脱离罪恶， 又使我们成为国民，作他父神的祭司。但愿荣耀、权能归给他，直到永永远远。阿们！」启示录在多处都记下「祭司」的形像（如：启 11：1－2）。同样，约翰在安慰受着逼迫的中亚细亚教会时，也重申他们是「诸王（就是属王室的），是祭司。」借着基督，我们已在祂的国度内与祂一起作王（启 20：4）。我们因信，得以在祂的复活有份，胜过罪、死和地狱。

K. Our entry into this priesthood was very beautifully described by St. Jerome in the 4th cent. when he wrote: "Baptism is the ordination of the laity." Luther also described the practical side of the universal priesthood when he gave the example: "Every father is pastor of his own household." As a member of Christ's royal priesthood, every Christian has been entrusted with a personal ministry of sharing God's Word with all people, and encouraging other Christians in their faith, using the same Word (gospel ministry of outreach and nurture).

圣耶柔米在第四世纪论到我们如何接受这祭司职时，很美妙的写到：「洗礼就是平信徒的授职礼。」路德也就普世祭司职指出其实际的一面，并举出例子说：「每一位为人父亲的，就是他家中的牧者。」作为尊贵基督祭司的成员，每个基督徒都肩负着个人的使命，跟所有人分享上帝的道，更用这道来建立其他信徒的信心（福音外展与栽培的事工）。

L. St. Peter also says, "You are a … holy nation." The Greek word "holy" has the idea of being "set apart" as something special. For example, the High Priest of the Old Testament wore a headband of gold with the words "Holy to the Lord" inscribed on it (Ex.28:36). Likewise, every Christian is "holy to the Lord", not because of personal piety or exemplary life, but only because the blood of Jesus Christ purifies us from every sin.(1 John 1:7)

圣彼得也说：「你们是……圣洁的国度。」希腊文中的「圣洁」带有为了特定目的而分别出来的意思。如旧约时代的大祭司，额上的金牌就刻上了「归耶和华为圣」（出 28：36）。同样，每一个基督徒都是「归耶和华为圣」，这并不是出于个人的虔敬或是已活出了生活的典范，乃是耶稣基督的宝血洗净我们的一切的罪。（约一 1：7）

M. Finally, "You are a people…belonging to God." Every Christian was "bought at a price" (1 Co. 6:20) with "the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect" (1 Pe.1:18-19). Peter also says, "Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. (1 Pe.2:10)." Psalm 24 says the same thing, that all people in the world belong to the Lord.

最后，「你们是……属神的子民」，皆因每一个基督徒都以基督的宝血，如同无瑕疵、无玷污的羔羊之血（彼前 1：18－19），「重价买来的」（林前 6：20）。彼得也说：「你们从前算不得子民，现在却作了神的子民。」（彼前 2：10）诗篇24篇也同样说所有世上的人都是属于主的。

N. Christians do not suffer from an identity crisis or wander through life with a lack of purpose. We are the people of God, and our first purpose as such is to live to the glory of God in all we do (1 Co.10:31, Is.43:21). Living to God's glory naturally means that we not only concerned about our personal relationship with God, but also concerned with our neighbor's relationship with him as well. For this reason Peter concludes (2:9), "that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light."

基督徒不会有身分危机的问题，或在生命路途上失去方向。我们是上帝的子民，我们首要的目的就是无论我们在任何方面做任何东西，都为着上帝的荣耀而活。（林前 10：31，赛 43：21）。为上帝的荣耀而活时，很自然的我们并不只是关注自己跟上帝的关系，而是更关心到我们的邻舍跟祂的关系。因此彼得总结说（2：9）：「要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗入奇妙光明者的美德。」

O. Christians do not merely try to be these four things Peter describes; from God's viewpoint Christians are these things. By calling us to faith in his Son, God automatically made us these things when he brought us into his family. The titles Scripture gives us are the common possession of all believers, and all equally have the right, responsibility, and privilege of declaring to others -- believers and unbelievers alike -- the wonderful works of God (Acts 2:11).

基督徒并不只是努力尝试做到这四点，彼得这样形容：从上帝的角度来看，这几点就是基督徒的本质。上帝藉祂的儿子叫我们信祂，祂将我们带入祂的家时，已经使我们有着这四个身分。这主题经文赋予所有的信徒同样的权利、责任和福份，向信徒和非信徒宣告上帝奇妙的作为（使 2：11）。

P. As 1 Corinthians 12 - 14 makes clear, God has given each Christian some spiritual gift for accomplishing his purpose for them. The greatest of these spiritual gifts is love -- love for God, love for fellow believers, and ultimately love for all people, since Christ died for all. The driving force in our personal ministry is the undeserved love God has shown us in Christ. As St. Paul says, "For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. (2 Co.5:14)." He also says, "Do everything in love. (1 Co.16:14)"

正如哥林多前书12至14章清楚说道，为了基督徒能够成就上帝在他们身上的计划，祂已经赐予每人一些属灵恩赐。这些属灵恩赐中，最大的莫过于爱──对上帝的爱、对其他基督徒的爱，和最终对所有人的爱，因基督为所有人死。而我们的个人使命的推动力，就是那上帝在基督里显明的爱，也就是我们毫不配得的爱。就像圣保罗说：「原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了。（林后 5：14）」并说：「凡你们所作的都要凭爱心而作。（林前 16：14）」
