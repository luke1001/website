A. As we begin our discussion of the public ministry, it is good for us to pause and remind ourselves that the word "ministry" means "service." All Christians are called to be servants of the Lord, expressing their gratitude over the gift of salvation by serving God and neighbor wholeheartedly. Read John 13:1-17.

在我们开始讨论公开侍奉之前，值得我们停一下来提醒自己，就是「侍奉」是「服务」的意思。所有的基督徒都是蒙召作主的仆人，并且全心全意侍奉上帝及邻舍，来表达我们对上帝救赎的感谢。参阅 约 13：1－17。

B. Those in the public ministry, then, are people whom God has given to his Church for special service. God makes it clear in his Word (e.g. Eph.4:7-11) that those in the public ministry are the risen and ascended Lord's gifts to his Church, and are to be regarded as such. The Lord of the Church has equipped his public ministers in special and unique ways to fulfill his purpose for them in serving the Church and world.

那些从事公开侍奉的，就是上帝赐给祂教会作特别侍奉的人。上帝在祂话语里清楚的说出（弗 4：7－11），从事公开侍奉的是那已复活升天的主给祂的教会的恩赐，并该得到如此的看待。教会的主已经以特别和独一的方式装备好为祂作公开侍奉者的，好让他们能成就上帝的旨意，侍奉教会和世界。

C. Though the sinful world cannot think this way, Christians realize that when God instituted a public ministry, he was not setting up a hierarchy or "power structure" within the Church. (Mt. 20:20-28). Following the example of Christ himself, those in the public ministry are not to be served, but to serve. Read 1 Peter 5:1-4 and Luke 17:10. Public ministers constantly remind themselves of the words of the Judge of all who said, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' (Mt.25:40)"

纵然这邪恶的世代不能理解，但是基督徒了解到上帝设立公开侍奉，不是要在教会内建立一个层级制度或是一个权力架构（太 20：20－28）。基督以身作则，来到不是要被侍奉，乃是侍奉别人，在公开侍奉的也当如此。请阅 彼前 5：1－4 和 路 17：10。公开侍奉者常以那审判世人的话来警醒自己：「我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。」（太 25：40）

D. When we use the term public ministry, we are talking about the ministry of the gospel which a qualified person is called to do in the name of and on behalf of fellow Christians. In some respects, the manner in which the public ministry work is similar to American government. All voters are equal citizens of America under the law, and our Constitution provides for rule "by the people". However, since it is completely impractical for every American citizen to go to Washington every week to vote on new laws and decide things, voters elect one of their own number to go to Washington to represent them and their interests. America has a representative government.

当我们说到「公开侍奉」，要指的是一个合资格的人受呼召而以其他基督徒的名义或代其所作的福音事工。公开侍奉的运作模式，从某些角度来看，跟美国政府的模式有很多相似之处。所有的选民在法律之下都是平等的美国公民，而美国的宪法提供了「以民」为治的基础。然而，让每一个美国国民每个星期到首都华盛顿，就新法案投票或作决定是绝不可行的，因此，选民选择他们当中的一人到华盛顿代表他们及他们的利益。美国拥有一个具代表性的政府。

E. Likewise, although all Christians are royal priests of God, some are chosen from among us to serve on behalf of God's people in the public ministry. The duties of the public minister are, in reality, no different that the duties assigned to every believer. However, since everyone cannot perform the same duties at the same time without disorder and chaos resulting, the body of believers delegates the authority to do some of the public functions of the gospel ministry to certain individuals. Although all Christians have the right to share the gospel, what would happen in a worship service if everyone wanted to preach on Sunday morning? Although all believers have been given the sacraments by the Lord and the right to administer them, what would happen on Sunday morning if everyone wanted to hand out the bread and wine? This, apparently, was part of the problem in Corinth. Paul simply told them that God wishes us to accomplish his mission in an orderly way (1 Co.14:33,40). God established the public ministry so that thing would be done in his Church in an orderly and loving way.

同样，纵然所有基督徒均是上帝的尊贵祭司，但在我们当中有些是被拣选的，代表上帝的子民在公开事工中侍奉。公开侍奉者的职责实质上跟任何一个信徒获指派的职责是没有不同的。但是每一个人同时间充当同一职责时，必然会引起混乱，所以信众把行使福音事工的部份公开职责的权力交托给一些人。虽然所有基督徒同样拥有分享福音的权利，但若然每一个人都要在星期天的崇拜中讲道，结果会怎样呢？同样，主赐圣礼和施行圣礼的权力给众信徒，若然众人都要在星期天早上分派饼和酒，情况又会变成怎样呢？这样的混乱显然正是哥林多教会有的一些问题。保罗就对他们说，上帝希望我们能够有秩序条理的完成祂指派的使命（林前 14：33，40）。上帝设立公开侍奉，目的就是在属祂的教会内，所有的事务能够有条不紊恰到好处地完成。

F. Also, God established the public ministry because every Christian does not have the same talents and gifts for service. In his Word Christ makes it clear that he has given an incredible variety of beautiful spiritual gifts to his people -- and every Christian has at least one spiritual gift -- to function on behalf of one's fellow Christians requires special qualifications.

此外，上帝设立公开侍奉还因为在侍奉上，每一个基督徒拥有的恩赐和专长也各有不同。上帝在祂的话语中，清楚表明祂赐了各式各样美好的属灵恩赐给祂的子民，而每一位基督徒拥有最少一种属灵恩赐──要代表其他基督徒侍奉需要特别的专长。

G. Christ established the public ministry of the gospel, and from the earliest days of the Church has provided public ministers for special service. The Apostles were set apart for special service to the Church. So were the seven deacons (Ac 6:1-6) and Paul and Barnabus (Ac 13:1-3). In Old Testament times, the Levites were set apart from their brothers for special service to God, functioning in the public ministry of the Lord.

基督建立了福音的公开侍奉，也由教会的最早期开始，为特别侍奉预备了公开侍奉者。使徒是为了特别侍奉而召选出来的，七位执事（使 6：1－6）和保罗与巴拿巴（使 13：1－3）也是如此。在旧约时代，利未人从他们的弟兄中被拣选特别为上帝侍奉，在主的公开侍奉中作工。

H. Who can serve as a public minister? As St. Paul said, "Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, he desires a noble task (1 Ti.3:1)." However, mere desire to serve in the public ministry is not the determining factor (cmp.Mark 5:18-19). According to Scripture, public ministers must meet certain qualifications.

哪些人可以成为作公开侍奉者呢？如圣保罗说：「人若想要得监督的职分，就是羡慕善工。这话是可信的（提前 3：1）。」可是只是渴望作公开侍奉并不是取决条件（比较 马可福音 5：18－19）。根据经文，作公开侍奉的必须符合一些资格。

I. Read 1 Timothy 3:1-13. Make a list here of the qualifications Paul mentions:

参照 提摩太前书 3：1－13，在下面列出保罗提及的资格。

J. Read Titus 1:5-11 and 1 Peter 5:1-4. List any different qualifications you notice.

参照 提多书1：5－11和 彼得前书 5：1－4，列出你留意到的其他资格。

K. Qualifications do not address the question of personal sin. The word "blameless" is not equal to "sinless." The qualifications address the matter of public (i.e. open, known) offense and reputation.

这资格不是讨论到个人的罪的问题。「无可指责」一词不是「完全无罪」的意思。这资格所关注的是为众人知道的过错和声誉。

L. Notice that the list of qualifications tells us that the Lord is more concerned about attitude than aptitude, more about humility than ability, more about people than about academics, more about care and prayer, more about searching than researching. The shining quality in Christ's public minister is deep love for God that expresses itself in humble service.

要留意的是列出的资格告诉我们，主关心态度而非资质，谦卑而非能力，关乎人而非关乎学术，在乎照顾与祷告，搜寻而非研究。对于基督的公开侍奉者，他的卓越素质，就是他在谦卑侍奉时所表达出对上帝深厚的爱。

M. But merely having the qualifications along with desire still is not enough. No one is to serve in the public ministry unless they have received a divine call to do so. A divine call is the public request that the congregation of believers makes to a qualified individual to serve on their behalf.

但是只有资格和对侍奉职份的心志仍不足够。除非得到圣召，否则不应从事公开侍奉。圣召就是会众向合资格的人发出的公开邀请，代表信众侍奉。

N. We call the call "divine" because it comes from the Lord Jesus Christ himself (Eph.4:7ff; 1 Co.12). In Acts 20:28 Paul tells the Ephesian elders that the Holy Spirit had made them overseers of the congregation. Sometimes the divine call came directly to an individual from the Lord. Moses was called directly by God, as was Jeremiah, the Apostles, Paul, etc. However, today a divine call into the public ministry comes to an individual from the Lord, but also through the Church. Read Acts 1:15-26 for the Scriptural basis of this truth.

我们称那呼召为神圣，因其是从主耶稣基督而来的（弗 4：7起；林前 12）。在使徒行传 20：28保罗告诉以弗所长老，说圣灵立了他们作会众的监督。有的时候，圣召直接从主临到个人。摩西是直接获上帝呼召，耶利米、使徒们、保罗等也是一样。但到了今天，圣召除了从主直接临到个人之外，亦是通过教会。关于这真理的经文根据可参阅 使徒行传 1：15－26。

O. The Scriptures do not teach the idea of a "self-call" or an "inner call." Often one hears a "street preacher" make the claim "The Lord told me to go preach in -------------." Also, one may run across a self-proclaimed "minister" who is asking for money to help begin a personal ministry. Although we don't automatically assume such people are frauds nor pass judgment on the value of their ministry, the better attitude that all public minister can have is, "Where and how would the Lord have me serve?" A public minister puts himself at the disposal of the Lord of the Church to be used as Jesus sees fit.

圣经没有教导我们关于「自我呼召」或是「内里呼召」。常听见「街头宣道者」声称：「主指派我到某某地方宣道。」此外，或会遇上自立为牧师的人，向人要求募捐，开展个人侍奉。纵使我们不自动地断定这些人是骗子或判断他们的事工价值，然而所有从事公开侍奉者更应该有的态度是：「主的心意是叫我到哪里并怎样去侍奉呢？」公开侍奉者是愿意随耶稣的意思，任由教会的主来差遣使用。

P. Although not required by Scripture, a worthwhile practice in the Church is the custom of public ordination / installation of called ministers. It is good for a number of reasons: 1) It shows everybody present that the minister's call is legitimate; 2) Everyone present -- both minister and congregation -- can publicly hear and see what the minister and congregation's respective responsibilities are; 3) The congregation can publicly welcome, pray for, and commit to God's guidance and care this minister whom Christ has given to them. Again, the call is what enables a man to serve in the public ministry, and not the rite of ordination.

虽然经文上没有要求，在教会中公开按立／任命获呼召为侍奉者的惯例，是有可取之处的。其中有数个好处：1）在众人面前，表明侍奉者的呼召是有效的；2）众人在场──包括侍奉者及会众──可以公开了解清楚侍奉者和会众双方面的责任；3）会众能够公开欢迎这位基督赐予他们的侍奉者，并且关心他，为他祷告，更把他交托给上帝带引。但是真正能使人可以从事公开侍奉的还是呼召，而不是按立的仪式。

Q. Under normal circumstance, a minister is ordained just once, at the beginning of his ministry. After that, he is installed at the various places he serves. The word ordained simply means "appointed." The laying on of hands does not confer special powers in a mysterious way, but is merely a symbolic act to show that a minister is being set apart by the Lord for special service to his Church.

在正常情况下，一位侍奉者只在他展开侍奉工作的时候，接收按立一次。此后，在他不同侍奉的地方受任命。接收按立的意思就是指受委任。按手不会传授神秘力量，只不过是象征着一位侍奉者被主拣选出来，为祂的教会作特别侍奉。

R. Public ministers are public called into the public ministry of the gospel. The ministry of a parish pastor is often (though not exclusively) referred to as the ministry of the Word. See Appendix 1 for a copy of a call document and the direction it gives for service in the public ministry.

公开侍奉者是受众人的呼召，在公开福音事工中效力。教区牧师的侍奉常被称为传道的圣职。关于呼召的文书和它对从事公开侍奉的指示，可参阅附件一。
