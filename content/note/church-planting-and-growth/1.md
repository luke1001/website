A. Our membership in Christ's Church began with God electing us to faith in eternity, even before the creation of the world. Read Ephesians 1:1-14.

我们在基督的教会有份，是从上帝在创世以前，在永恒里拣选我们相信那一刻开始的。参阅 弗 1：1－14。

B. When we say God elected us (predestined) we mean that God both knew and chose certain individuals to be saved even before he created the world. God's chosen ones (elect) will be in heaven forever when the history of this world is over; there is no chance that God's elect will not be in heaven. The Church of Jesus Christ is, properly speaking, the total number of the elect.

我们说上帝拣选（预定）我们，意思是指上帝在创世以前，已经知道并且拣选将会得到救赎的人。上帝拣选的人（选民）在现世的历史结束后，将会永远在天上。上帝所拣选的每一个人都必定会到天上，一个也不例外。耶稣基督的教会，严格来说，就是所有上帝拣选的人的总体。

C. The human mind is inclined to assume that if God chose certain people for salvation, that must mean that he also decided to choose other people to spend eternity in hell. This teaching, developed by the Swiss reformer John Calvin and called "double predestination" (or unconditional election) cannot be shown from the pages of Scripture. It is a teaching that finds its source in human reason, and not God's Word.

人的想法有一个倾向，就是上帝既然拣选了部份的人接受拯救，便假设上帝亦同时拣选了其余的人到地狱里受永恒之苦。这样的教导是由瑞士宗教改革者加尔文发展出来的，或者称为「双重预定」（或无条件拣选）。但有关的教导在圣经上没有得到任何经文支持，其基础是出于人的推论，并不是出于上帝的话语。

D. The basis for God's election is the work of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2). Because of what Jesus did through his life, death, and resurrection, the entire world has been declared "not guilty" of their sins (universal, objective justification).

耶稣基督所作的工是上帝拣选的基础。祂因世人的罪的缘故，为他们舍命（约3：16；约一 2：2）。正因为耶稣透过祂的生命、死和复活而成就的，世人得以被宣判「无罪」（普世，客观称义）。

E. However, God has also decided that the only way to receive the benefits of Jesus work (forgiveness, new life, salvation, etc.) is through faith (subjective justification). Paul explains this clearly in Romans 1 and 3. Scripture teaches that whoever believes in the Lord Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins will be saved (Acts 16:31).

但上帝也定下了唯一能够从耶稣的工作中受益（如赦免、新生命、拯救等）的方法就是透过信（主观称义）。这一点保罗在罗马书第一章及第三章解释得很清楚。经文教导的就是凡相信耶稣并求祂赦免的，必定得救（徒 16：31）。

F. God elected his believers to faith even before the creation of the world. When these chosen ones were finally born, God made sure they would come to faith by arranging the events of his/her life so that they would come into contact with the gospel, believe it, continue in faith, and die in the one true faith.

上帝在创世以前，已经拣选了信祂的人。当被拣选的人在地上出生后，祂会确保他们踏上信心的道路。祂透过安排他们生命里发生的事件，让他们接触福音，并且相信，持守真信仰直到生命的终结。

G. First God called us to faith. God calls people to faith through the voice of the gospel. Although the law (10 Commandments) are universally known and even written in our hearts (natural law), the law cannot save anyone, but only condemn. Only the gospel creates faith.

上帝先呼召我们相信。祂以福音的声音呼召众人。纵使律法（十戒）为世人所认识，甚至刻在我们的心里（天生的行为准则），然而律法不可以拯救任何人，只能定罪，唯有福音才能生信心。

H. This call to faith comes through the means of grace. The Holy Spirit doesn't appear in visions or simply enter our hearts in a moment of "religious experience." The Holy Spirit works through the gospel, which comes to us in the form of the Word and sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper).

这个呼召是透过恩典的媒介而来的。圣灵不会在异象出现，或者在一刻间的「宗教体验」进入我们的心中。圣灵是透过福音作工，而福音就以道和圣礼（洗礼、圣餐礼）的形式来到我们之中。

I. Conversion refers to the Holy Spirit changing a person from an unbeliever into a believer. Even faith is a gift of God through the Holy Spirit, so conversion is entirely God's work. No one chooses to be a Christian or "decides for Christ," or "lets Jesus into his heart." The sinful mind we are all born with (Ps. 51:5) hates God and wants nothing to do with him (Ro. 8:7). Since we are spiritual dead by nature (Eph.2), God must intervene in our lives and bring us to faith. Without faith in Christ a person is eternally damned.

悔改归主是指圣灵把一个不信的人变成信徒。正如信心也是上帝透过圣灵而赐下的恩物，悔改归主亦全是上帝的所作的工。没有人选择成为基督徒或是「拣选基督」又或是「让耶稣进入心里」。我们与生俱来的罪性（诗51：5）仇视上帝并背离祂（罗 8：7）。因我们天生在属灵上已死（弗 2），上帝必须干预我们的生命，并且带引我们相信。一个人若没有信靠基督的心，是永远受咒诅的。

J. Through the gospel the Holy Spirit not only brings a person to faith, but also keeps us in the faith and sanctifies the believer. Sanctification means that the Holy Spirit lives within the Christian, working in cooperation with the believer's new spirit to do good works (Php. 2:12-13, Gal. 5:22-25). We will never be perfect this side of heaven, but with the Spirit's help we work toward that goal. Growing in faith naturally means also growing in living our faith.

圣灵通过福音除了叫人相信之外，还保守我们的信心并使信徒成圣。成圣的意思是圣灵住在基督徒的心里，与信徒内里已更新的灵一同作美的善工（腓 2：12－13，加 5：22－25）。虽然我们在地上没有可能做到完美，但有了圣灵的帮助，我们能够向目标努力。在信心上的成长理所当然地也包括在活出我们信仰上的成长。

K. God does this work of calling, converting, and sanctifying people throughout the world, regardless of age, gender, or race. He also does this regardless of a person's outward association with any one, visible church body. The true Church of Jesus is invisible, and no one, visible church body can alone claim to be the only true Church of Jesus. The true Church of Jesus is made of all people who trust in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. This group includes all believers on earth, known only to God, as well as the saints in heaven who have died in the faith.

上帝在世上各处呼召人悔改归主，使他们成圣，祂作这工时不会考虑人的年龄、性别和种族的因素。祂的工作也不受那人是否跟任何一间可见的教会有联系而影响。那真正属耶稣的教会是眼不可见的，是无形的。没有一间教会可以单独宣称是唯一真正属耶稣的教会。那真正属于耶稣的教会是由所有倚靠耶稣赦罪的人所组成，包括全部只有上帝能辨识的地上信徒，以及那些坚守信心至死不移的天上众圣徒。
