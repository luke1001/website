论题 7：基督赋予祂的教会有自由，为着执行教会使命而建立不同形式的公共侍奉。

Key Terms 重要词汇：

Christian Freedom 基督徒自由

Local congregation 地方会众

Full-time ministry 全职侍奉

Part-time ministry 兼任侍奉

Synod 宗会

A. As Scripture makes clear (Gal.5), New Testament Christians are set free from any and every ceremonial law of the Old Testament. St. Paul asserts that the only thing that matters is "faith expressing itself through love. (Gal.5:6)"

在经文上写得很清楚(加 5章)，新约的基督徒已经从旧约的所有任何律法仪式释放出来。圣保罗指唯一重要的就是「使人生发仁爱的信心（加 5：6）」

B. Faith expresses itself in love through personal and public ministry. Personal ministry calls us to share Christ's love individually with those in need of it. Public ministry calls individual Christians to join together to see that they, as a group functioning as Christ's representatives, are fulfilling the mission Christ gave the Church.

信心透过个人和公共侍奉，在爱中表达出来。个人侍奉呼召我们，个别的跟那些有需要的分享基督的爱。公共侍奉呼召各个基督徒个体团结起来，作为代表基督的群体，完成基督托咐教会的使命。

C. Read Matt. 18: 15-20. Here Christ simply says that "two or three" functioning in the name of Christ, using the Keys, are "church." A group of two or three has the right to publicly function in the name of Christ, for the accomplishing of the Church's mission.

参阅 太 18：15－20。在这里基督说「两三个人」奉基督的名聚会，行使钥匙，就是「教会」。两三个人一起的小组已经有权公开奉基督的名作工，成就教会的使命。

D. To many, the most visible form that the Church takes as it carries out her mission is the local congregation. The local congregation gathers in the name of Christ to worship and pray together, encourage and serve one another. The local congregation has the right to call public ministers, and the right to publicly use the Keys in their midst.

当教会奉行她的使命时，对于很多人来说，她最显然易见的形式是地方会众。地方会众奉基督的名聚首，一起敬拜、祈祷、互相鼓励侍奉。地方会众有权呼召公共侍奉者，也有权在他们中间使用钥匙。

E. The one gospel ministry has been entrusted to the local congregation by the Lord himself. In Christian freedom¸ the local congregation has the right to establish various forms of the public ministry to serve in the interest of outreach and nurture. God has not specified the exact number of ministries or exact nature such public service is to take.

主自己亲自把那福音的单一事工交托予地方会众。在基督徒拥有的自由度下，地方会众有权成立各种形式的公共侍奉，来达至外展和栽培的目的。上帝没有指明确实多少侍奉或公共侍奉的性质。

F. In a congregation, the role of pastor is, naturally, the most comprehensive form of public ministry. He is the overseer of the flock. However, God in his Word does not indicate that this is the only divinely-instituted form of the public ministry. The New Testament gives other examples: apostles, prophets, elder/overseer, deacon, evangelist, and teacher.

在会众中，牧师的角色很自然地是最全面的公共侍奉表现。他是羊群的监督。但是上帝在他的话语中没有说这是唯一一种由上帝订立的公共侍奉形式。在新约中有不少其他的例子：使徒、先知、长老／监督、执事、传道人和教师。

G. "We should perhaps add a note here that the Scriptures do not limit service in the public ministry to men. Women, too, may serve in the public ministry of the church. To say that women teachers in the elementary schools of the church are serving in the public ministry, for example, is in keeping with the way the Scriptures speak. They are serving in the name of and by call of the congregation.

"Likewise, there is nothing in the Scriptures to prevent a woman from serving in the name of the congregation as a part of [a] committee… The Bible does speak, however, of a role relationship between men and women that needs to be maintained. A woman should therefore not be asked to serve in a form of ministry that inherently includes authority over a man (cf. 1 Timothy 2:11-14), e.g. serving as a pastor, an elder, or the head of a decision-making committee whose makeup includes both men and women." (D. Vallesky, We Believe, Therefore We Speak, (NPH,1995) p. 153)

「我们或许应该作少许的补充，就是经文中没有规定公共侍奉的职份必须由男性担当。女性亦可以在教会作公共侍奉。举一个例，说女性教师在教会的基础学校是从事公共侍奉，这是跟经文的说法一致的。她们是以会众的名义和受会众的呼召来侍奉。

「同样，经文中没有阻止女性接受会众的受权成为委员会的部份成员……但圣经却有说明男性和女性之间的角色关系有需要维持。因此，女性不应该被邀请担任一些在本质上凌驾男性的侍奉职务（参 提前 2：11－14），如当牧师、长老或在包括男女成员组成的决策委员会当主席。」（D. Vallesky, 我们也信，所以也说话（We Believe, Therefore We Speak）, (NPH, 1995) 153页）

H. While the pastor often serves in many different roles and capacities in the office of his public ministry, his basic task is twofold: 1) Nurture God's people and 2) Equip God's people for service. Read Ephesians 4:7-16.

正当一个牧师执行他的公共侍奉职份时，侍奉上常常包括不同的角色和程度，但基本上他的工作是基于两方面：1）栽培上帝的子民和 2）装备上帝的子民作侍奉。参阅 弗 4：7－16

I. As the primary nurturer of God's people, the pastor will feed the flock. He will either teach or oversee all instruction in the Word. Part of feeding the flock will naturally include guarding the flock; the pastor is to be able to spot false teaching and faithfully instruct his people about it so that they will not be "tossed about" and so shipwreck their faith. As nurturer, the pastor will also guide the flock. The pastor is a leader, and he is to lead it along paths that are pleasing to God. Leadership is a spiritual gift (1 Co.12), and the pastor's leadership abilities (or lack thereof) often affect the entire congregation.

作为上帝羊群的首要栽培者，牧师需要喂养羊群。他要教导或监督所有有关上帝话语的教导。喂养羊群当中自然包括守护羊群。牧师需要察觉到假教义，并信实的教导会众，使他们的信心不致飘来飘去，触礁沉没。作为栽培者，牧师也指引羊群。牧师是领袖，他应带领羊群走上取悦上帝的路。领导才能是一项属灵恩赐（林前 12章），牧师的领导才能（或缺乏之）往往影响整个会众。

J. The pastor is also to equip God's people for works of service. God never intended that his public ministers are to do all the work FOR the congregation. In fact, it is a sign of an unhealthy congregation where the pastor alone does the majority of the congregation's work.

牧师也装备上帝的子民作侍奉的工。上帝的原意不是要祂的公共侍奉者替会众完成所有的工作。事实上，当牧师为会众作大部份的工时，这已是会众变得不健康的一个迹象。

K. By equipping God's people we mean that the pastor prepares his people to serve God and neighbor in Christian love. The pastor will take responsibility to find out the individual talents of each of his people and see to it that they are trained to use their spiritual gifts. Through his leadership in the congregation, he will also train his people to look for and establish various outlets for God's people to use their talents; a congregation not only provides for growth in faith but also opportunities for God's people to put their faith into action both in the church and in their secular lives. (See Appendix 2: "Reception of New Members") In this way the body of Christ is built up.

装备上帝子民的意思，是牧师准备他牧养的人，以基督的爱来侍奉上帝和他们的邻舍。牧师要负责找出每一个人拥有的才能，以致他们得到培育，善用他们的属灵恩赐。透过他对会众的领导，他也得训练他们发掘并建立不同的渠道，使上帝的子民能够发挥他们的才能。让教会不单助长信心成长，也为上帝的子民能够在教会和自己的平常生活中化信心为行动提供机会。（参阅 附录2：接待新成员（Reception of New Members）。这样，基督的身体就得到建立起来。

L. Any public minister who is called to serve God and his people as a primary occupation is said to be in the full-time ministry. This is in contrast to the part-time ministry. Part-time ministers in the church also have calls from their fellow Christians to serve in their name and on their behalf. Such part-time ministers may include such people as Sunday School teachers, congregational president, elders, evangelism chairmen, church council men, etc. Part-time ministry assignments usually are more limited in scope than full-time assignments, and often require less training. The term part-time ministry is sometimes also referred to as lay ministry, although the use of that term may be confusing to some.

任何又被呼召的公共侍奉者，若以侍奉上帝和他的子民作为他的主要职业，便称为从事全职侍奉，这跟兼任侍奉是相对的。兼任侍奉者同样得到基督徒弟兄姊妹的呼召，以他们的名义和代表他们侍奉。这些可能包括主日学教师、会堂会长、长老、宣教主席和教会委员会委员等。兼任侍奉的分配工作在范畴上，通常会较全职侍奉的小，一般来说也不要求那么多训练。兼任侍奉有时亦称为平信徒侍奉，这或许对一些人造成一点混淆。

M. In New Testament freedom, full-time ministers may have a variety of forms of service to the church, all of which are in harmony with the Church's mission. Pastors, professors, grade and high school teachers, preschool teachers, home and world missionaries, home and world mission counselors, planned giving counselors, administrators, and staff ministers are some of the variety of forms that the one gospel ministry may take. See the diagram on p.125 in Church-Mission-Ministry.

在新约所容许的自由中，全职侍奉者可以以不同形式侍奉教会，这些不同的形式都跟基督的教会使命一致。牧师、大中小学和幼儿园的教师、国内外宣教士和宣教顾问、策划顾问、行政人员和职员，这些工作都可以成为那福音的单一事工的侍奉形式。参阅 教会－使命－事工（Church-Mission-Ministry）125页的图解。

N. Both full and part-time ministers are to have legitimate calls from a calling body. Especially when a group of Christians has two or more called ministers, for the sake of good order they will want to carefully detail what areas of service and authority belong to each call.

从事全职或兼任侍奉的，均要从授权的得到有效的呼召。尤其是当一群基督徒中间有两个或以上当侍奉的，为了有秩序起见，他们需要把侍奉范围和权责分清。

O. In New Testament freedom, Christ also permits local congregations to organize into other, larger grouping for the purpose of accomplishing the Church's mission. All such groupings in the name of Christ are to be considered "church" in the proper sense.

在新约所容许的自由中，基督也容许地方会众为达成教会的使命而组合成更大的群体。这些奉基督的名组合的群体，严格来说是「教会」。

P. In the past, this point has been much debated inside Lutheranism, and remains one of the key dividing points between the WELS and the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. (See Appendix 3: "Introduction to Theses on the Church and Ministry" in Doctrinal Statement of the WELS, 1997, p.39-42)

过往这点在路德宗内引起了不少的辩论，至今仍然是威斯康辛路德福音会跟路德会密苏里宗会的分歧。（参阅 附件三：威斯康辛路德福音会的教义声明的「教会与事工论题导论」（Introduction to Theses on the Church and Ministry），39页至42页，1997年。

Q. While the local congregation remains the most visible and beautiful expression of the Church, we believe, teach, and confess that other groupings of Christians, gathered in the name of Christ and to do his work, are also truly "church." As such, these other groupings have the authority to preach the Word, administer the Sacraments, and use the Keys.

当地方会众仍是基督的教会最明显且最美的表现时，我们同时相信、教导并且宣认其他基督徒组成的群体，只要是奉基督的名聚集并作祂的工的，就真的是「教会」。既是如此，这些群体就有权柄来宣讲上帝的道，施行圣礼和运用钥匙。

R. Such larger groupings may include a synod, a group of synods (CELC - See Appendix 4), a synodical district (and its boards), synodical schools, Christian publishing houses, area Lutheran high schools, charitable institutions, even lay-organizations (such as WELS Kingdom Workers). Since freedom also must be handled responsibly, brotherly love will cause all organizations to be considerate of one another, communicating various plans and activities, and striving to act in the best interest of Christ's kingdom first, and not in self-interest.

这些较大的群体可以是一个宗会、一群宗会（基督教福音路德宗联合会（CELC）－参附件四）、一个宗会区域（及其董事会）、宗会学校、基督教出版社、地区的路德会中学、慈善机构，甚至平信徒的组织（如威斯康辛路德福音会国度工作者）。由于自由需要负责任地去行使，所有组织之间要以弟兄的爱互相体谅，就各个计划和活动作沟通，为基督国度的最大益处努力，而不是为己私利。

S. The various forms of the ministry are a testament to how richly the risen and ascended Christ has gifted his people for service. Along with St. Paul, may we each pray for the spirit of unity, each part laboring for the common cause of Christ, so that in all service God is glorified and souls won for eternal service in heaven. Read Romans 5:5-17.

众多不同形式的侍奉，见证着那复活并升天了的基督这么大大的赐各种侍奉的恩赐给祂的子民。跟圣保罗一样，让我们各人祈求合一的精神，各个部份共同为基督的缘故付出努力，以致在所有侍奉上，上帝都得荣耀，灵魂也为永恒的侍奉得救赎。参阅 罗马书 5：5－17。
