#### Focus 9 – Be aware. Satan does not like God’s truth. 重点9 - 要小心，撒旦不喜悦神的真理。

(1) Sadly, Satan is working very hard among God’s Christian people and congregations. The devil works to divide and ruin God’s Gospel and the Word among us.

不幸的是，撒旦非常努力的在属神的基督徒和会众中工作。魔鬼的工作要分裂和毁坏在我们中间的神的福音及圣道。

(2) When a church, whether large or small, house church or organized, turns from the Good news of Jesus and the Word, they are referred to as an apostate church.

当一间教会，无论大小，家庭教会还是有组织的，如果转离了耶稣和圣道的福音，就是一间背离信仰的教会。

(3) When a church leader turns from the Gospel and the Word and proclaims a gospel that is really no gospel at all, they are apostate.

当一间教会的领袖转离了福音并宣讲根本不是福音的信息，他们就是背教者。

(4) Be aware, apostate churches may have written confessions that seem Biblical and truthful. Yet, if those could be understood in wrong ways there will be danger. We are to write and speak so that we are understood and also so that we are not misunderstood. Our written confessions are to be compared with the truth of Scripture not whether they sound good.

要小心，背道的教会也可能会写下信仰宣言看起来合乎圣经也合乎真道，然而如果这些宣言可能被以错误的方式理解就将带来危险。我们所写所讲皆应能被正确理解且不会被误解。我们写下的宣信要和圣经的真理比较而不是仅仅看起来不错就可以了。

(5) Another warning: if the written confession sounds good, but what is taught, the sermons, and practical expressions not the same as the Bible, there is danger to God’s people and to the church.

另一个警告：如果写下的宣信看起来不错，但是所教导的、讲章和实践和圣经不同，就对神的子民和教会带来危险。

(6) How do the following Scriptures guide Christian leaders and pastors to act?

下述的经文怎样引导基督徒带领者和牧者的行动？

Matthew 7:15 ﻿ “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

马太福音7:15 你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。

Matthew 24:24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were possible.

马太福音24:24 因为假基督、假先知将要起来，显大神迹、大奇事，倘若能行，连选民也就迷惑了。

Matthew 16:11-12 But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” ﻿12﻿ Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

马太福音16:11-12 我对你们说：『要防备法利赛人和撒都该人的酵』，这话不是指着饼说的，你们怎么不明白呢？」12门徒这才晓得他说的不是叫他们防备饼的酵，乃是防备法利赛人和撒都该人的教训。

1 John 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

约翰一书4:1 亲爱的弟兄啊，一切的灵，你们不可都信，总要试验那些灵是出于　神的不是，因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。

Revelation 3:15-16 ﻿I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! ﻿16﻿ So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.

启示录3:15-16 我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。16你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。

(7) Following are some specific teachings that to this teacher mark a church or leader who has become apostate.

下面一些特定的教导，本教师将教导这些的教会或带领者视为背道者。

(8) If the church or teacher states that Jesus is not true God or that Jesus is not true Savior, or that Jesus is not physically real – that leader or church is apostate.

如果这间教会或教师声称耶稣不是真正的神或者耶稣不是真正的救主，又或者耶稣并不真实存在——这样的带领者或教会是背道者。

1 John 4:2,3 ﻿This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, ﻿3﻿ but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.

约翰一书4:2,3 凡灵认耶稣基督是成了肉身来的，就是出于　神的；从此你们可以认出　神的灵来。3凡灵不认耶稣，就不是出于　神，这是那敌基督者的灵。你们从前听见他要来，现在已经在世上了。

(9) If the church or teacher states that Jesus did not physically rise from the dead, or that the resurrection is a parable or a figure of speech – that leader or church is apostate.

如果这间教会或带领者声称耶稣并没有真的从死里复活，或者复活的事是比喻或是形象的语言——这样的带领者或教会是背道者。

1 Corinthians 15:12-17 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? ﻿13﻿ If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. ﻿14﻿ And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. ﻿15﻿ More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. ﻿16﻿ For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. ﻿17﻿ And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.

哥林多前书15:12-17 既传基督是从死里复活了，怎么在你们中间有人说没有死人复活的事呢？13若没有死人复活的事，基督也就没有复活了。14若基督没有复活，我们所传的便是枉然，你们所信的也是枉然；15并且明显我们是为　神妄作见证的，因我们见证　神是叫基督复活了。若死人真不复活，　神也就没有叫基督复活了。16因为死人若不复活，基督也就没有复活了。17基督若没有复活，你们的信便是徒然，你们仍在罪里。

(10) If the church or teacher states that they do not believe or profess that God is triune – he or she is an apostate teacher.

如果这间教会或带领者声称他们不信或不承认三一神——他/她就是一个背道的教师。

(11) If the church or teacher encourages something other than salvation through faith in Christ – he or she is an apostate teacher.

如果教会或教师鼓励的不是藉着在基督里的信心得救——他/她就是一个背道的教师。

(12) The following teachings seriously can harm the Christian.

下面的教导会严重的伤害基督徒。

(13) If the leader talks more about sanctification or the Christian life but then also speaks very little about justification and how we are right with God, that teacher has a serious imbalance in their ministry which can seriously damage the souls of those in that congregation.

如果带领者更注重成圣或基督徒生命却很少地讲称义和我们已经与神和好，这样的教师在他的事工中有非常严重的失调，这样会严重的伤害会众。

(14) If a leader or teacher speaks extensively about the law, but very little about the Gospel, that teacher has a serious imbalance in their ministry which can seriously damage the souls of those in that congregation.

如果带领者或教师大量讲到律法，很少地提到福音，这样的教师在他们的事工中有非常严重的失调，将会严重的伤害会众。

(15) If the truth of Scripture is minimized, that teacher has a serious imbalance in their ministry which can seriously damage the souls of those in that congregation.

如果圣经中的真理被缩小了，这样的教师在事工中有非常严重的失调，这样导致对会众严重的伤害。

2 Timothy 3:16-17 ﻿All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, ﻿17﻿ so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

提摩太后书3:16-17 圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，17叫属　神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

John 8:31-32 ﻿To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. ﻿32﻿ Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

约翰福音8:31-32 耶稣对信他的犹太人说：「你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒；32你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自由。」

(16) If we compare false teaching, non-Biblical teaching, or imbalanced teaching with poison how much poison does it take to kill the spirit of the Christian?

如果我们将错误的教训，不合圣经的教导，或是失衡的教导和毒药相比较，使用多少毒药就会杀死基督徒的灵命？
