#### Focus 1 – Perception of the Bible 重点1 - 圣经观

(1) The Biblical perception that a person brings to their study and their ministry makes a large difference in their work. Be aware of what perception you bring to your study and what perception other teachers bring to their studies.

一个人带进学习和事工的圣经观将极大的影响到他们的工作。要留意你在学习中所带入的圣经观以及其他教师在他们的教导中所带入的圣经观。

##### Perception 1 观点1

The Bible is interpreted, understood, and applied on the basis of what has been said and concluded about the text before, such as through Jesus’ Vicar on earth (the Pope), the council of wise and studious leaders, and traditions that have arisen from the work and ministry of the Church in the past. A weakness of this perception is that we listen more to the pope, councils, and traditions, than to the Word of God. The main advocate of this perception is the Roman Catholic church.

圣经的解释，理解，应用要基于以前的总结，比如通过耶稣在地上的代理（教皇），智者和学者的会议，以及历史上教会的工作和事工所遗留的传统。这种观点的缺点是，我们听从教皇，会议，传统多于听从神的话。主要持这种观点的是罗马天主教会。

##### Perception 2 观点2

The Bible is God’s Word, we approach our studies in a scholarly way, and we have the attitude that God speaks to his people through the Bible. Most Lutherans adhere to this perception, some Reformed and some Evangelical also apply.


圣经是神的话语，我们以做学问的方式来学习，并且我们持有神会透过圣经对祂的子民说话的态度。大多数的路德宗信徒持有此观点，部分改革宗和一些福音派人士也是如此。

##### Perception 3 观点3

The Bible is God’s Word, we approach our studies in a scholarly way, and we have the attitude that we interpret the Bible. This perception is very attractive to those who base much of their study of Scripture and Christian activity on their own will. Most Reformed and most Evangelical groups recognize and apply this Biblical perception.

圣经是神的话语，我们以做学问的方式来学习，并且我们持我们自己来解释圣经的态度。这种观点非常受那些基本上靠自己来学习经文和基督徒行为的人的欢迎。大多数的改革宗以及大多数的福音派组织承认并应用这种圣经观。

##### Perception 4 观点4

The Bible is God’s Word, and all texts of Scripture are viewed and interpreted with the Holy Spirit’s work and ministry in mind. All Christian churches have an emphasis on the Holy Spirit’s guidance and work. Yet those with this Biblical perception make the Holy Spirit the primary emphasis of their understanding of Scripture. The churches which have this focus are Pentecostal and charismatic in ministry.


圣经是神的话语，并且认为无论是阅读所有圣经上的话语或对其进行解释都与圣灵的工作有关。所有基督教会都着重于一位圣灵的引导和工作。持此圣经观者在明白圣经方面尤其强调圣灵的工作。持此观点的教会是五旬节派和灵恩派。

##### Perception 5 观点5

The Bible is God’s Word and the Bible is perceived and understood extensively through and with the question, “What are we Christians to do?” Every Christian church will emphasize application of Scripture. Yet, those with this perception primarily apply the Bible as a handbook for Christian life. Many evangelical churches have this emphasis upon Biblical study.

圣经是神的话语并且理解和明白圣经常常要透过这样的一个问题，“我们基督徒要怎样做？”每个基督教教会要强调圣经的应用。甚至，持此观点者主要把圣经看作是一本基督徒的生活守则。大多数福音派教会在圣经学习上强调这种观点。

Some Christian churches will mix a couple of the above perceptions, yet it seems, after observation, that they will primarily have one of the five emphases briefly examined above.

一些基督教教会的观点可能混杂了上述观点中的几点，然而，通过观察可知，他们通常主要含有上述五点总结之一。

Your teacher uses and teaches with perception 2 as his foundation of good, Biblical study.

你的老师采用观点二并以此作为好的，合乎圣经学习的教导的基础。

Scriptural exhortations that guide our understanding of point (6) below.

针对以下第六点内容的圣经教导。

2 Peter 1:20-21 ﻿Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation. ﻿21﻿ For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

彼得后书1:20-21 第一要紧的，该知道经上所有的预言没有可随私意解说的；21因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出　神的话来。

2 Timothy 3:15-17 ﻿and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. ﻿16﻿ All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, ﻿17﻿ so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

提摩太后书3:15-17 并且知道你是从小明白圣经，这圣经能使你因信基督耶稣，有得救的智慧。16圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，17叫属　神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

John 17:17 ﻿ Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.

约翰福音 17:17 求你用真理使他们成圣；你的道就是真理。

John 5:39-40 ﻿You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, ﻿40﻿ yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

约翰福音5:39-40 你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生；给我作见证的就是这经。40然而，你们不肯到我这里来得生命。

(6) Be aware that there will be those who speak of themselves as Christian, but they interpret and apply Scripture in ways that communicate that the Bible is not God’s Word. Some statements may be as follows …

要小心那些自称为基督徒的人，他们解释并应用经文时显示出圣经并不是神的话语。以下是一些可能的例子……

(a) The Bible contains God’s Word - some that is written in the pages of the Bible is God’s Word, but some is not.

圣经包含神的话 - 圣经中有一些是神的话语，但也有一些不是。

(b) The Bible becomes God’s Word as you understand its truth. The Bible is God’s Word whether a person understands what the Lord is saying or not.

当你明白其中的真理时，圣经就是神的话了。无论人们是否明白主所说的，圣经都是神的话语。

(c) The Bible is a historical book that provides wisdom to those who read it. While the Bible has a history and does give wisdom, it is much more. The Bible is the Word of God which the Lord Jesus uses with the Holy Spirit to bring people to faith and empower their Christian life.

圣经是一部让读者有智慧的历史书籍。尽管圣经是一部流传下来的书籍，给人智慧，但圣经不仅如此而已。圣经是神的话语，是主耶稣用来藉着圣灵带领人归信并加添基督徒生活的力量。

(d) The Bible is written by people who felt godly inspiration. While men did write the words, they were not writing on their own. They were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

圣经是由受神感动的人所写的。虽然是人手写成的文字，但却不是单靠人所写成的。他们是被圣经所带领的。

(e) The Bible is a human work in which godly men wrote about what they knew or thought they knew about God and wished to communicate that wisdom with others.

圣经是一部人的作品，是圣人写下的关于他们对神的认识或自以为对神的认识，并希望把这些智慧也传播给别人。

(f) The Bible is to be understood along with many other religious books.

明白圣经需要同时阅读很多其它的宗教书籍。
