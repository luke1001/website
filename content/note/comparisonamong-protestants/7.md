#### Focus 7 – Irresistible Grace. 重点7 - 不可抗拒的恩典

1) "Irresistible grace," also called "efficacious grace", asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom God has determined to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.”

“不可抗拒的恩典”也被成为“有效的恩典”，宣称从神而来的救恩是有效的应用在那些神决定要拯救的人身上（即被拣选的人）并且会克服他们对福音呼召的抗拒，带他们进入信心中。这意味着，当神至高的主权决定救赎某人时，那个人就一定被救赎。这个教义认定神圣灵有目的的影响是不能抵抗的，圣灵“充满恩典的使被拣选的罪人来合作，相信，悔改，自愿前来就近基督”

2) In this point Professor Calvin asks the question, “How is the step taken between unbelief and faith.” Many people answer that it is our will which chooses to believe or not. We will speak about this later in this focus. Professor Calvin’s answer is that God’s grace is irresistible so that whoever God elects to faith will be moved from unbelief to faith by the total will of God. They are unable to resist. Their conversion will happen because God’s sovereign will dictates it.

在这一点上，加尔文教授问了这样一个问题：“在不信和信之间是怎样跨越这一步的”很多人回答说是我们的意志来选择信或不信。我们将在这篇重点课程中的稍后部分讨论这一点。加尔文教授对这个问题的回答是神的恩典是不可抗拒的，所以无论谁被神拣选进入信心里都将完全因神的意志而从不信到信。他们不能够抗拒。他们的归正的原因是神至高的旨意命定如此。

3) Again two Biblical teachings influence Professor Calvin’s conclusion:

同样，有两点圣经教导影响加尔文教授做出以上结论： 　

1. God has total, sovereign power and

    神有完全的至高能力并且 

2. There are those elected by God.

    有人被神拣选。


4) To those two points Professor Calvin adds his logical assertion that election also includes those who are doomed. Those who are doomed are elected by God’s sovereign power to be doomed. We spoke about that assertion in Focus 6 and this teacher’s answer to Professor Calvin.

在这两点之外，加尔文教授还添加了他的逻辑主张，拣选还包括被咒诅的人。那些被咒诅的人是被神的至高能力拣选受咒诅的。我们已经在重点6中讨论过这一点及本教授对加尔文的回应。

5) From those three points Professor Calvin concludes, that those elected by God will have faith. They cannot resist the power of the Almighty God. They will come to faith. Those who resist are those on whom God has not applied his power. God has elected them to their own destruction.

因这三点，加尔文教授的总结是，被神旨意拣选的人将有信心。他们无法抗拒大能的神。他们必将进入到信心里。那些抗拒的人都是神没有在他们身上施行大能的人。神拣选他们进入到他们自己的毁灭中去。

6) “Irresistible grace” is not a Biblical teaching, but an assertion rising from non-Biblical logic.

“不可抗拒的恩典”不是一个合乎圣经的教导，而是一个由不合乎圣经的逻辑做出的推论。

7) There are no Biblical passages that speak about “irresistible grace.”

没有圣经的经文提到“不可抗拒的恩典”。

8) There are no examples in God’s Word that that some are condemned because grace is withheld from them.

在神的话语里没有这样的例子：有些人被咒诅是因为恩典没有临到他们。

9) Truly, Pharaoh was hardened by God, but why isn’t Pharaoh an example of “irresistible grace”?

的确，法老被神所刚硬，但为什么法老不是一个“不可抗拒的恩典”的例子呢？

10) Why isn’t Judas Iscariot an example of irresistible grace? Focus on how the Lord Jesus spoke to Judas in the upper room and out at Gethsemane.

为什么加略人犹大不是一个“不可抗拒的恩典”的例子呢？注意主耶稣在马可楼上和客西马尼园外是如何与犹大谈话的。

11) What about Saul’s conversion in Acts?

扫罗在使徒行传中的归正是什么情形？

12) What does the following passage point out about “irresistible grace”?

下述经文对于“不可抗拒的恩典”有哪些说明？

1 Timothy 2:3-4 ﻿This is good, and pleases God our Savior, ﻿4﻿ who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.

提摩太前书2:3-4 这是好的，在　神我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。4他愿意万人得救，明白真道。

13) If the Lord wants all people to be saved, then the LORD would naturally apply “irresistible grace” to all people. Ultimately the LORD certainly does have the power.

如果主愿意所有人得救，那么上主将自然应用“不可抗拒的恩典”在所有人身上。从根本上说，神具有那样的能力。

14) There are many times in the Scriptures that God’s grace is spoken about. Many of those passages are addressed to Christians about the grace which they have in Christ Jesus. We will examine four passages more closely.

圣经中多处提到神的恩典。其中大部分经文都是与基督徒谈论他们在耶稣基督里而有的恩典。我们将更细致地查考四处经文。

Romans 3:23-24 ﻿for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, ﻿24﻿ and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.

罗马书3:23-24 因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了　神的荣耀；24如今却蒙　神的恩典，因基督耶稣的救赎，就白白地称义。

15) Paul points out that all people are sinners. After stressing that all are sinners, the Holy Spirit says that justification is available to all. God’s justification is provided to all “by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.”

保罗指出所有的人都是罪人。在强调所有人都是罪人后，圣灵说人人都可能称义。神的义为所有“蒙　神的恩典，因基督耶稣的救赎”的人。

16) From that passage are we taught that grace is limited only to those chosen by God or is grace available to all people?

从这段经文中我们得知恩典是否是仅限于被神拣选的人或所有人都能得到恩典？

Romans 5:15 ﻿ But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! … ﻿18﻿ Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.

罗马书5:15 只是过犯不如恩赐，若因一人的过犯，众人都死了，何况　神的恩典，与那因耶稣基督一人恩典中的赏赐，岂不更加倍地临到众人吗？……18如此说来，因一次的过犯，众人都被定罪；照样，因一次的义行，众人也就被称义得生命了。

17) On the basis of verse 15 we might assert that grace only came “to the many,” not to all. Yet in the context we note that Jesus’ “one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.” Life cannot come to all men except through grace. Grace and justification are two different terms with different emphases, but they are inseparable in the actions of God. Justification is for all people and will not come to all people without grace for all people.

在15节的基础上我们可能仅仅确定恩典只对“众人”有效，而不是所有人。然而在其背景中，我们注意到耶稣的“因一次的义行，众人也就被称义得生命了”（译注：此处采用中文和合本经文，两处15、18节两处均译为“众人”而讲义中英文圣经在15节可直译为“众人”，18节可直译为“所有人”）生命除非通过恩典否则不能临到所有人。恩典和称义是两个不同的词汇、强调不同的意思，但他们在神的工作中是不可分割的。称义是为所有人预备的并且若离开了为所有人的预备的恩典就不能临到所有人。

18) The following passage from Titus shows even more that grace and justification are connected.

下述经文取自提多书，更多的显示出恩典和称义的联系。

Titus 3:5-7 ﻿he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, ﻿6﻿ whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, ﻿7﻿ so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.

提多书3:5-7 他便救了我们；并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是照他的怜悯，借着重生的洗和圣灵的更新。6圣灵就是　神借着耶稣基督—我们救主厚厚浇灌在我们身上的，7好叫我们因他的恩得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣。

19) A notable point is that the above text would have been an excellent text to speak about the impact that God’s sovereign power has on conversion and God’s grace. We could paraphrase to take into account Professor Calvin’s thoughts - Titus 3:5-7 ﻿5﻿ he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his sovereign power active in his mercy. His sovereign power saved us by irresistibly working the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, ﻿6﻿ whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, ﻿7﻿ so that, having been justified by his sovereign power through his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. There are many passages which address our salvation in Christ that could have plainly professed the importance of God’s sovereign power. Yet, there are none because Grace is founded upon our Lord’s love not his sovereign power.

我们注意到以上经文中可能是一个非常好的经文来说明神至高的能力在归正和神的恩典上的影响。我们可以尝试意译这一段来考虑加尔文教授的思想 —— 提多书3:5-7 5他便救了我们；并不是因我们自己所行的义，乃是因祂至高的能力显在祂的恩慈中，祂至高的能力借着不可抗拒的工作：重生的洗和圣灵的更新来拯救了我们。6圣灵就是　神借着耶稣基督—我们救主厚厚浇灌在我们身上的，7好叫我们因祂至高的能力藉着祂的恩典得称为义，可以凭着永生的盼望成为后嗣。还有很多阐述我们在基督里的救恩的经文也可以直接改为表述神至高能力的重要性。然而，没有一处这样做，因为恩典是基于我们主的爱而不是祂至高的能力。

20) The next passage points out that some have fallen from grace. If grace is irresistible, no one can fall from grace.

下一段经文指出有人从恩典中失落了。如果恩典是不可抗拒的，没有人会从恩典中失落。

Galatians 5:4 You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.

加拉太书5:4 你们这要靠律法称义的，是与基督隔绝，从恩典中坠落了。

21) There are no other passages which so directly say that a person can fall from Grace. Even so, with all the other Biblical truths we have examined, we must conclude that grace neither comes from God’s sovereign power or is irresistible.

没有其它的经文直接的说明一个人可以从恩典中堕落。既便如此，藉着我们所有已经查考过的经文，我们一定会得出这样的结论：恩典既不是由神至高的能力而来也不是不可抗拒的。

22) How might a thought similar to “irresistible grace” have influenced the Pharisaic teaching that Jews are saved by being from the family of Abraham? (Irresistible family?)

和“不可抗拒的恩典”类似的概念会怎样导致法利赛人式的教导，如犹太人是因为有亚伯拉罕为他们的祖宗而得救的？（不可抗拒的宗族？）

23) Have you heard of any texts which speak of God’s power moving his grace rather than God’s love?

你是否听过哪些经文讲到神的恩典是由祂的能力驱动而不是被神的爱驱动？

24) How people move from unbelief to faith is an important one and has been addressed through church history. Listed below is a useful summary of those ideas.

人们是怎样由不信到信的是一个重要的问题，在教会历史上曾经被广泛讨论。下面列出了一些对相关论点有用的总结。

25) Pelagious (A.D. 390-418) asserted that human kind has the ability and total responsibility to choose to believe. The grace of God has been earned by Jesus. Every person, when approached by the word of God must choose to believe or reject that promise of forgiveness in Christ Jesus. The church did not accept Pelagius’ assertion because his thought made salvation our work not Christ’s grace.

伯拉纠（公元后390-418年）宣称人类有能力并且对选择相信负完全的责任。神的恩典已经由耶稣赚得。每一个人，当神的话语临到的时候必须选择相信或拒绝在耶稣基督里的赦罪应许。教会并不接受伯拉纠的主张，因为他的思想使救恩基于我们的工作而不是基督的恩典。

26) Some of Pelagius’ contemporaries recognized the truth that Pelagious was making salvation our work and not Jesus’ grace. They proposed what would become known as semi-pelagianism. In the assertion known as semi-pelagianism Jesus sets the person on the right course and then the responsibility for faith or rejection becomes the person’s. He or she can accept or reject what Jesus has placed into them. The semi-pelagian assertion was rejected by the church also because it focused on the person’s strength and works, rather than on Christ’s cross.

有一些和伯拉纠同时代的人认识到伯拉纠将救恩变成我们的工作而不是耶稣的恩典这一真理。他们便提出现在称为半伯拉纠主义的思想。在半伯拉纠主义的思想中耶稣将人预备好，之后接受信心的责任就落在人的身上。这样的人可以接受或拒绝耶稣放在他们里面的。半伯拉纠主义的主张也同样被教会所拒绝，因为它关注于人的力量和工作而不是基督的十字架。

27) The Roman Catholic system asserted that God infuses grace into every human being and with grace infused it is up to each person by faith and by works to follow the Lord and be his people. Ultimately the person’s works became more important than faith. Martin Luther stood against this assertion because of the emphasis made upon works.

罗马天主教系统声称神把恩典注入到每个人身上，恩典被注入后，每个人可以藉着信心和行为自行决定是否跟随主和成为主子民。最终一个人的行为变得比信心更加重要。马丁路德针锋相对的反对这一主张，因为其将重点放在行为上。

28) Martin Luther (A.D. 1483-1546) had grown up a son of the Roman church. He had worked very hard to be forgiven by God. Over time Jesus moved him to realize that we are not saved by works but by faith in Christ. Faith is the gift of God provided by grace. The Lord breaks through the hardness of the heart and moves the person to believe by grace.

马丁路德（公元1483-1596）在罗马天主教会中长大。他非常努力的践行以至于可以被神赦免。渐渐的耶稣感动他明白我们不是靠行为得救而是靠在基督里的信心。信心是神藉恩典所赐的礼物。主打破人的硬心并感动人靠恩典相信。

29) Arminius (1560-1609) had been a devoted student of John Calvin. Over time he began to see the problems with the main teachings of Calvin including “irresistible grace.” Arminius asserted that people could resist grace and that our will was necessary to believe.

阿民念（1560-1609）曾经是加尔文虔诚的学生。渐渐的他发现加尔文主要教导之中的问题，包括“不可抗拒的恩典”。阿民念声称人可以抗拒恩典并且在信上我们的意志是必须的。

30) One of Arminius’ students summarized his thinking about grace as follows.

阿民念的一个学生将其对恩典的思想总结如下。

31) Grace is resistible: God takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people. This grace (often called prevenient or pre-regenerating grace) acts on all people to convince them of the Gospel, draw them strongly towards salvation, and enable the possibility of sincere faith. Picirilli states that "indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted." The offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.

恩典是可抗拒的：神是救恩的起头并且祂的恩典给予了所有人。这个恩典（常被称为预恩或先生的恩典）在所有人生命里做工，感化他们信福音，把他们拉向救恩，并且得以产生真诚的信心。Picirilli说：“确实，这样的恩典和重生如此接近必然导致重生，除非是最终拒绝了”救恩的赐予是藉着恩典而来，并不是纯粹的因果关系、一成不变的方法而不可抗拒，而是以一种影响-回应的形式，可以自由地接受或拒绝。

32) What Arminius’ states sounds good except for two points. First, he asserts that each Christian must choose faith. We profess that faith is a gift of God. Second, related to the first, Arminius asserted that people have free will so that they can believe or reject.

阿民念的观点看起来没错但有两点问题。首先他声称每一个基督徒必须去选择相信。我们认信的是信心是从神而来的礼物。其次，和第一点相关，阿民念声称人们有自由意志可以选择相信或拒绝。

33) We do not agree with Arminius second point stated in the previous paragraph. Scripture asserts that without faith people are dead in sin, they see God’s Word as foolishness, and that the sinful mind is hostile to God.

我们不同意阿民念上述的第二个观点。经文言明没有信心的人是死在罪中的，他们看神的道是愚拙的，并且罪性是与神为敌的。

34) While we did discuss this in a previous focus, these verses are informative.

尽管我们已在前面的重点课程中讨论过，以下的经文还可以提供参考。

Ephesians 2:1 How is the nature of the person in bondage to unbelief spoken about in this text?

As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, …

以弗所书2:1 这段经文中是怎样表述人的本性和不信紧密相连的？

1你们死在过犯罪恶之中，……

Romans 8:7 How is the nature of the person in bondage to unbelief spoken about in this text?

7 the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.

罗马书8:7 这段经文中是怎样表述人的本性和不信紧密相连的？

7原来体贴肉体的，就是与　神为仇；因为不服　神的律法，也是不能服，

1 Corinthians 2:14 How is the nature of the person in bondage to unbelief spoken about in this text?

The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

哥林多前书2:14 这段经文中是怎样表述人的本性和不信紧密相连的？

14然而，属血气的人不领会　神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙，并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。

35) The summary which the LORD expresses after the flood also makes the point that man’s will is against God’s will and on our own, we can’t come to faith in Jesus as Savior.

上主在大洪水后所说的话也说明了人的意愿是抵挡神的意愿的，并且靠我们自己，是无法进入信心里接受耶稣为救主的。

Genesis 8:21 The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.

创世纪8:21 耶和华闻那馨香之气，就心里说：「我不再因人的缘故咒诅地（人从小时心里怀着恶念），也不再按着我才行的灭各种的活物了。

36) With the qualities of sinful nature mentioned by the above texts, we can only conclude that people cannot come to faith on our own. That is a logical conclusion based on the severe way in which human nature has been marred and warped by sin and Satan.

按照上述经文中提到的罪性，我们只能得出结论说，人不能靠自己进入到信心里。这是根据人性被罪和撒旦严重毁坏和弯曲而得出的合乎逻辑的结论。

37) Paul clearly states that salvation is a gift of God and not based upon our works.

保罗清楚的指明救恩是神的礼物不取决于我们的行为。

Ephesians 2:8-9 ﻿8﻿ For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— ﻿9﻿ not by works, so that no one can boast.

以弗所书2:8-9 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是　神所赐的；9也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。

38) Faith believes God and is credited as righteousness. Paul expresses this truth about Abraham. The same applies to us. Believe the Lord and that is credited as righteousness.

信心是相信神、被算为义。保罗用亚伯拉罕的例子表述这个真理。也同样应用在我们身上。相信主、这就被算为义。

Romans 4:1-5 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? ﻿2﻿ If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. ﻿3﻿ What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” 4﻿ Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. ﻿5﻿ However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.

罗马书4:1-5 如此说来，我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕凭着肉体得了什么呢？2倘若亚伯拉罕是因行为称义，就有可夸的；只是在　神面前并无可夸。3经上说什么呢？说：「亚伯拉罕信　神，这就算为他的义。」4做工的得工价，不算恩典，乃是该得的；5惟有不做工的，只信称罪人为义的　神，他的信就算为义。

39) The fantastic Biblical truth we are speaking about is “justification.”

我们所讨论的这个绝妙的圣经真理就是“称义”

Romans 5:17 Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.

罗马书5:16 因一人犯罪就定罪，也不如恩赐，原来审判是由一人而定罪，恩赐乃是由许多过犯而称义。

40) The Biblical term translated “justification,” comes from the Greek courtroom. In a crime the judge would listen to the evidence and once the evidence is provided would make a declaration of guilt or innocence on the basis of the evidence. If the defendant was guilty, he or she would be declared guilty. If the defendant was found innocent he or she was justified, declared innocent of any wrong doing. All who believe in Jesus Christ as Savior are declared innocent of sin because of Jesus. God looks at the evidence of sin, which has been paid for by Jesus, and declares those with faith as justified. The Biblical term “justification” is a powerful term of forgiveness in Christ Jesus.

经文用词“称义”是从希腊法庭而来。在一件罪案中法官将听取证据，如果证据充分，就会依据证据来判定有罪或无罪。如果被告人被判有罪，他/她就将被宣布为有罪。如果被告人被认为是无罪的，他/她就将被称为正当的（译注：英文justification的字面意思）与任何错事无关。所有相信耶稣基督为救主的是因着耶稣的缘故宣布和罪无关。神看到罪的证据，其代价已被耶稣所付上，就宣布在信心里的是正当的了。圣经用语“称义”表达了强烈的在耶稣基督里的赦免。

41) Without using the term “justified” Paul refers to how Abraham was viewed by God (In Romans 4 Paul refers to Genesis 15:6 and 15:22).

除了使用词语“称义”保罗还提到神怎样看待亚伯拉罕（在罗马书4章，保罗引用了创世纪15:6和15:22）

Romans 4:1-3 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? ﻿2﻿ If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. ﻿3﻿ What does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

罗马书4:1-3 如此说来，我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕凭着肉体得了什么呢？2倘若亚伯拉罕是因行为称义，就有可夸的；只是在　神面前并无可夸。3经上说什么呢？说：「亚伯拉罕信　神，这就算为他的义。」

42) Abraham believed God and so God saw him as righteous, credited him with righteousness even though Abraham’s day to day life did not show perfect righteousness. Abraham is God’s example of justification in the Old Testament.

亚伯拉罕信神因此神看他为义人，算他为义，尽管亚伯拉罕每天的生活并没有显示出完美的义。亚伯拉罕是神在旧约中称义的例子。

43) Because of Jesus’ death on the cross as payment for sins, all who believe in Jesus are given that same credit as Abraham. All who believe in Jesus are justified by God himself because of Christ Jesus.

因着耶稣死在十字架上作为罪的赎价，所有相信耶稣的人也像亚伯拉罕一样被算为义。所有相信耶稣的人就因为耶稣基督的缘故被神自己称义了。

44) Romans 3:21-22 speaks about this blessing from God. People are provided a righteousness that comes from God through faith in Jesus.

罗马书3:21-22节讲到这个从神而来的祝福。人得以从神那里获得义，是藉着相信耶稣而有的。

Romans 3:21-22 ﻿But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. ﻿22﻿ This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

罗马书3:21-22 但如今，　神的义在律法以外已经显明出来，有律法和先知为证：22就是　神的义，因信耶稣基督加给一切相信的人，并没有分别。

45) The Holy Spirit and the Word are the tools that God uses to break through hard hearts.

圣灵和圣经是神所使用的工具用以打破人的硬心。

2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 ﻿But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. ﻿14﻿ He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

帖撒罗尼迦后书2:13-14 主所爱的弟兄们哪，我们本该常为你们感谢　神；因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。14神借我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。

1 Corinthians 6:11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

哥林多前书6:11 你们中间也有人从前是这样；但如今你们奉主耶稣基督的名，并借着我们　神的灵，已经洗净，成圣，称义了。

1 Corinthians 12:3 Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

哥林多前书12:3 3所以我告诉你们，被　神的灵感动的，没有说「耶稣是可咒诅」的；若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说「耶稣是主」的。

Romans 10:17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.

罗马书10:17 可见，信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。

1 Peter 1:23 For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.

彼得前书1:23 你们蒙了重生，不是由于能坏的种子，乃是由于不能坏的种子，是借着　神活泼常存的道。

46) From Scripture we need to conclude that God does not use coercive force to bring a person to Christianity. God proclaims his grace, mercy and good news about Jesus and people are moved to believe. Coming to faith is God’s work not our work. And coming to faith is not forced on anyone. Salvation is based upon God’s grace, not force.

从经文中我们可以总结出神没有使用强制的能力来使人成为基督徒。神传扬祂的恩典，慈爱和关于耶稣基督的好消息，人因此被感动而相信。就近信心是神的工作而不是我们的作为。就近信心也不是强迫任何人。救恩是基于神的恩典而不是强迫。

47) This teacher cannot think of any example in Scripture in which someone with faith is spoken of as forced on a person. What examples might you have heard that we can discuss?

本教师想不出圣经上有任何例子说明有人相信是被强迫的。你是否听过哪些事例我们可以就此讨论。

48) Does Saul’s conversion to Paul the Apostle fit?

扫罗归正成为保罗属于这种情形吗？

49) We can only state what Scripture states that (1) coming to faith is God’s Work not ours – in the chart seen in the appendix, this is call monergistic conversion.

我们只能讲说圣经所说的：（1）就近信心是神的工作不是我们的作为 - 在附录中的表格里这被称为神恩独作的归正。

50) About rejection, we can only say what Scripture says, that (2) people reject what God has given in Christ.

关于拒绝，我们只能讲说圣经所说，（2）人会拒绝神在基督里所赐的。

51) As you can tell from both of the immediately preceding points, we are God’s people and need to speak as the Lord guides in his Word.

从以上论述往前推，你可以得出两点：我们是神的子民，需要按照主话语里的引导来宣讲。

52) Only when the Christian has faith, then we can apply our will to spiritual matters. Although, many times we do not apply it well. We still sin and give in to temptation.

只有当基督徒有了信心之后，我们才可以将我们的意志应用在属灵的事物上。尽管我们常常不能很好的应用。我们仍然会犯罪并在试探中失败。

Ephesians 4:22-24 ﻿You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; ﻿23﻿ to be made new in the attitude of your minds; ﻿24﻿ and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

以弗所书4:22-24 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的；23又要将你们的心志改换一新，24并且穿上新人；这新人是照着　神的形象造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。

53) Yet for the whole of our life, we have a sinful nature that struggles against God will.

然而我们的一生之中，我们的罪性常常的在抵挡神的旨意。

Galatians 5:17 For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.

加拉太书5:17 因为情欲和圣灵相争，圣灵和情欲相争，这两个是彼此相敌，使你们不能做所愿意做的。

54) Our Christian life is one of spiritual growth so that we can apply Christian will better. We grow. We apply. We fight against Satan.

我们基督徒的生命是一个灵命增长的过程，以至于我们更好的实践基督徒的意志在我们生命中。我们成长、践行。我们争战来抵挡撒旦。

55) But, before we become Christians, we do not have a will that can cooperate with God or turn to him.

但是，在我们成为基督徒之前，我们没有可以与神同工或转向祂的意志。
