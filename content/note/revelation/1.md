Now compare these events with the words of Jesus about his Second Coming on the Last Day in Matthew 24:29-30, with the words of Peter about the destruction of the world in 2 Peter 3:10, and with Peterâ€™s words on the day of Pentecost as he quotes the prophet Joel in Acts 2:20





Matthew 24:29-31 29"Immediately after the distress of those days " 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' 30"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. 31And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
