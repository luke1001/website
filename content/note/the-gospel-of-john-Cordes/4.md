1 HOLY BIBLE: New Testament – New Evangelical Translation (NETNT), Second edition (January 1992), with major revisions, 15,000 copies. (Cleveland, Ohio: NETNT Publishing), 1992, p. 173. Used by permission.
2 NETNT, pp. 173-217. Used by permission. The skillful way in which the NETNT editors carried John’s theme of “the WORD” throughout their outline illustrates why I requested permission to use their work. The outlines, notes and appendices of this stalled Evangelical Lutheran translation are some of the finest I’ve seen anywhere. [M.C. 1/13/2005]
