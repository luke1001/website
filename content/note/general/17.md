学习圣经的学生应建立什么样的基础？
WHAT FOUNDATION IS THE BIBLE STUDENT BUILDING ON?
学习圣经的学生应建立什么样的基础？
Opinions I have about the Bible even before I study it play a big role in Bible interpretation. The beliefs I have starting out will make a big difference in how well I understand the Bible. Today we will look at the main beliefs we need to have about the Bible to have it make sense for us like God wants it to.
我对于圣经的观点,甚至在开始学习圣经之前我对圣经所持的观点，对解释圣经起着重要的作用。我的起始信念对我怎样很好地理解圣经也会造成很大的差异。今天我们来看对于圣经我们应具备的主要信念，用以帮助我们按神的正意来理解圣经。
Read John 3:16. 读约翰福音 3:16
Can an unbeliever understand what these words mean? 非基督徒能理解这些话吗？
Read 1 Corinthians 2:14. 读哥林多前书 2:14
1.      What does Paul say about an unbeliever's ability to understand the Bible?
保罗对于不信教的人的理解圣经的能力是怎么说的？
2.      Compare both of your answers so far. How can we say that unbelievers can understand the Bible and then say that they cannot understand the Bible?
和你的答案相比较。我们怎么能说不信教的人能理解圣经，然而又说他们不能理解圣经？
3.      Agree or disagree: Unbelievers can make sense of God's Word just as well as Christians.
同意与否:不信教的人能象基督徒一样明白神的话语。
Both unbelievers and believers can understand God's Word the right way if they read it in an honest way using God's gift of common sense. Because unbelievers don't really understand the significance of Jesus' life and death, they'll have trouble making sense of a lot of the Bible. Their sinful urges and instincts react negatively to the Bible's main message. Without the Holy Spirit, they will get the wrong message out of the Bible's clear words.
非信徒和信徒如果使用神赐予我们的常识，诚实地阅读他的话就都能正确理解神的话语。因 为不信的人无法真正明白耶稣的生和死的意义，他们很难认同圣经中的许多东西。他们罪性的强烈欲望和本能会负面对待圣经的主要信息。没有圣灵指引，他们将从 圣经清晰明白的话语中得出错误的信息。
THE WHOLE BIBLE IS ABOUT JESUS - FOUNDATION #1
整本圣经是关于耶稣----基础 #1
How important a Bible student believes Jesus is makes a big difference in how he understands the Bible.
学习圣经的学生相信耶稣有多重要对他理解圣经会造成很大差异。
Read John 20:31. 读约翰福音 20:31
1.      Why did God give us his Word? 为什么神给了我们祂的话语？
loves to read his Bible. In it he finds everything he needs to live by. The Old Testament rules for living help him make wholesome decisions for his life. Jesus' words about love help Dave's relationships. The New Testament Letters contain all kinds of helpful principles to live by. But Dave has missed the main thing the Bible is trying to communicate - about Jesus. How is this going to hurt the way he looks at the whole Bible?大卫喜欢读圣经。在神的话里他找到他生存需要的一 切。旧约中的生活法则帮他做出有益的决定。耶稣 关于爱的话语帮他处理各种关系。新约的书信包含所有我们生存的有用法则。但大卫没理解圣经要传达的主要的事----耶稣。这将对他对于整本圣经的看法带来怎样损害？
The person who knows Jesus is the heart of the Bible will not misinterpret all the passages that speak how He rescued us.
懂得耶稣是圣经的中心的人不会误解所有关于他如何拯救我们的信息。
GOD GAVE US EVERY WORD OF THE BIBLE - FOUNDATION #2
圣经的每一句话都出自神----基础 #2
How people view where the Bible came from and what it's all about will make a big difference in how they understand it.
圣经从哪里来，它传达什么样的信息，人们对此的不同看法对他们如何理解圣经会造成很大差异。
Read 2 Timothy 3:14-17. 读提摩太后书 3:14-17。
1.      What are some of the ways God wants us to use the Bible?
神让我们使用圣经的方法有哪些？
2.      While taking a required college course in ancient writings, Julie had learned that the Bible is like any other great book, something very smart people put together. She looks at the Bible that way. However, she doesn't want to let it tell her what to do, mostly because she wants to divorce her husband. Julie wonders why someone who lived many years ago in a different culture should tell her that what she's doing is wrong. She interprets many of the Bible's statements as thoughts from long ago that don't apply any more today. How do Julie's opinions about the Bible influence how she interprets Scripture?
朱莉在学习古代著作的必修课时，她听说圣经和其他伟大 的书籍一样，是由非常聪明的人们一起参与写的。她就这样看待圣经，然而，她不想让圣经告诉她该做什么，主要是因为她想和丈夫离婚。她琢磨为什么要让很久以 前生活在不同文化下的人告诉她所做的事是错的呢？她把圣经上的话理解是很久以前的思想，不再适应现代生活。朱莉对圣经的看法如何影响她对圣经的理解？
3.      Why will Christians want to be serious and honest about how they interpret Scripture?
为什么基督徒对他们如何理解圣经，要持严肃并诚实的态 度？
Read John 10:34-37. 读约翰福音 10:34-37
Consider the words and the Scripture cannot be broken. What is Jesus saying about the truthfulness of Scripture?
认为圣经上的话和经文不能废除。耶稣对于圣经的真实性是怎么说的？
If people trying to make sense of the Bible believe God wrote it and everything in it is true, they will want to avoid any interpretation that sends a different message than what the Bible says.
如果人们要明白圣经，相信是神所写，每句话都是真的，他们就会避免任何有别于圣经的解释。
THE BIBLE MEANS WHAT IT SAYS - FOUNDATION #3
圣经传达的信息就是经文本身----基础#3
Who would argue with that? The fact is, though, a lot of people don't believe that the Bible means what it says.
谁会与此争辩呢？然而，事实上很多人不相信圣经传达的信息就是经文本身。
When Martin Luther was studying to become a priest in the Catholic church, his teachers interpreted the Scripture using the allegorical method-all verses of Scripture are picturing something different. You could make a verse say almost anything you wanted it to say.
当马丁路德在天主教教会学习成为神父时，他的老师用寓意的方法解释圣经--所有的经文在描述与经文本身不同的东西。你可以把一节经文讲解成你想说的任何事。
The Bible teaches us to look for the one main thing it is saying.
圣经教导我们要寻找它讲述的那件主要的事。
Read Matthew 2:3-6. 读马太福音 2:3-6
The Jewish leaders wanted to know where the future Savior would be born. They looked up the Old Testament Bible book of Micah and found the answer. Compare their way of handling Scripture with the way Luther's teachers handled it.
犹太领袖想知道未来救主在哪出生。他们查找旧约的弥迦书，找到了答案。请将他们运用圣经的方法和路德的老师的方法作个比较。
Read Acts 2:24-33. 读使徒行传2:24-33
How does Peter approach Scripture in these verses? 在这些章节里，彼得是如何解释经文的？
Read Romans 6:8. 读罗马书6:8
How does Paul explain David's words? 保罗如何解释大卫的话？
Read John 6:30-33. 读约翰6:30-33
How did both Jesus and the Pharisees explain Moses' account of the miracle of the manna?
耶稣和法利赛人如何解释摩西叙述的关于吗哪饼的奇迹？
Scripture says what it means. The author wrote down exactly what he intended to say. Bible interpretation is nothing more than honestly describing, in other terms, the simple, basic meaning of what the text says.
经文本身传达了它的信息。作者准确记录他想说的。解经仅仅是以另一种形式来忠实叙述经文的简单的，基本的意思。
Summary 总结
Opinions I have about the Bible even before I study it play a big role in Bible interpretation. An unbeliever can't reach a correct understanding of the main message the Bible is trying to communicate. The Bible words are not complicated. They mean what they say. These words can lead an unbeliever to faith.
In practice, however, a Christian will be able to offer a more solid interpretation. Christians know that Jesus is main message the Bible is trying to explain. They believe that every word in it comes from God himself, so they are careful about how they interpret it. Because Christians consider Jesus the most important thing in life, they're willing to spend the necessary time to study the Bible carefully so their interpretation is well thought out. Christians will approach Scripture with the humble faith that it says what it means.
我 对于圣经的观点甚至在开始学习之前，在解释圣经上起着重要的作用。一个不信的人无法正确理解圣经要传达的主要信息。圣经语言并不复杂。经文本身就是要表达 的意思。这些话能引导不信的人相信。在实践中，一个基督徒能够提出更坚实的解释。基督徒知道耶稣是圣经要解释的主要信息，他们相信圣经中的每一句话来自神 自己，所以他们很小心如何解释圣经。因为基督徒认为耶稣是生命中最重要的，他们愿意花必要的时间仔细地学习圣经，所以他们的理解是经过深刻思考的。基督徒 以谦卑的态度理解圣经，相信圣经传达的信息就是它所说的话 。
Use the immediate context 运用紧密联接的上下文
Many of the rules for correctly understanding the Bible that we'll talk about in this lesson do not come from the Bible. They are the same rules we automatically use anytime we read any book. So you won't always find a section of Scripture quoted to back up the point being made.
The first rule of Scripture is something you naturally do as you read a Sunday newspaper or best-selling novel. You let the context determine the meaning of the section you're reading.
Use the immediate context-the verses immediately before and after the verse you are thinking about-to help you determine the meaning of a passage.
我们在这课谈到的很多用以正确理解圣经的原则不是从圣经里来的。他们和我们阅读任何书自动使用的原则一样。所以你不会总在圣经的段落里找到引用去证明已成立的观点。
第一条规则和你读周日报纸或畅销小说时自然做法一样。你让上下文决定你读的段落的意思。
紧密联系上下文--你思考段落的前后章节--来帮助你判断段落的意思。
Read John 3:16. 读约翰福音 3:16
What is the meaning of the world in this verse? How does the context help you interpret those words?
在这节中世界是什么意思？上下文如何帮你解释这个词？
Read 1 John 2:15. 读约翰一书 2:15
What is the meaning of the world in this verse? How does the context help you interpret those words?
在这节中世界是什么意思？上下文如何帮你解释这个词？
Most Scripture passages can be interpreted simply by observing the immediate context.
大多数圣经章节仅通过观察上下文就可以解释出来意思。
Use the wider context 运用非紧密联接的上下文
Sometimes only the wider context of Scripture will help you discover the meaning of a verse. The wider context might include other sections of the book you are reading, other writings by the same author, or the Bible as a whole.
有时联系更远的上下文将帮助你发现一节的意思。更远的上下文可能包括你读的其他部分，其他作者写的内容，或者联系整本圣经。
Read John 21:15. 读约翰福音 21:15
The setting is in Galilee after Jesus came back to life. The disciples were in their boats fishing. They had caught nothing. Jesus told them to throw their nets on the right side of the boat, and they caught a lot of fish. The disciples and Jesus had just finished eating breakfast. Jesus asked Peter if he loved Jesus "more than these."
地点在加利利，耶稣已复活，门徒在船上打鱼，一无所获。耶稣叫他们在船右侧撒网，这次他们捕了很多鱼。门徒和耶稣刚吃完早饭。耶稣问彼得是否爱他"比这些更深"？
1.      What might the word these refer to in the immediate context?
根据上下文，这句话中"这些"是什么意思？
2.      Read John 13:37,38; Matthew 26:33. 读约翰福音 13:37，38；马太福音26:33
3.      What is a better explanation of the word these in light of these passages?
根据这些段落，对于"这些"更好的解释是什么？
4.      After what we've learned, why can we say that regular Bible reading and studying help us grow in our ability to interpret Scripture?
为什么在我们学习了这些后可以说经常读圣经，学习圣经能帮助我们提高解释经文的能力？
We can better understand a lot of Bible sections by looking at their
immediate context. For other parts of the Bible we'll have to have a more complete knowledge of the Bible. The better we know the wider context, the better we will be able to interpret Scripture.
通过运用紧密联接的上下文，我们能更好理解很多圣经章节。对于其他部分，我们应具备更完全的圣经知识。越能通晓广泛的上下文，我们越能更好解释圣经。
Let clearer passages decide the meaning of more difficult ones
让意思更清楚的段落决定难理解的部分的意思
Some passages seem difficult or unclear. When you come across that kind, be patient. Look for other parts of the Bible that better explain the one you are having problems with.
有些段落难以理解，意思不清楚。碰到这些，要有耐心，到圣经中其他的部分去寻找答案来更好地解释这个问题 。
Read Matthew 7:1. 读马太福音7:1
Some people like to use this passage to escape being labeled as sinners.
有些人喜欢这节，用以逃脱被贴上罪人的标签。
1.      True or false: In Matthew 7:1 Jesus tells us that under no circumstances should we ever judge anyone else's actions or motives.
1.      判断对错:马太福音 7:1 耶稣教导我们绝不能论断他  人的言行和动机。
Before you answer this question, work through the following questions and use the context of Scripture to help you interpret this verse.
在回答这个问题前，完成以下问题，用经文的上下文来帮助你解释这一节。
3.      Read verse 2, the immediate context. What does it tell you?
读第二节，联系上下文。这节告诉你什么？
4.      Read verses 15 and 16, the wider context of the chapter. How do these verses help us better understand verse 1?
读15和16两节，这一章更远的上下文。这两节如何帮你更好的理解第一节？
5.      Read 1 Corinthians 5:1-5,12 the wider context of Scripture. What light do these verses shed on our question? Also, turn to John 7:24.
读哥林多前书 5:1-5，12  圣经中更远的上下文。这些章节如何更清楚对我们的问题给以解释？再看约翰福音7:2 4
6.      Answer the question we started with. What is the meaning of Matthew 7:1?
回答我们开始时的问题。马太福音7:1 是什么意思？
Read Romans 8:29,30. 读罗马书8:29，30
Paul refers to God's foreknowing us and electing us to come to faith. These verses have been hard to understand for many. How does Ephesians 1:3-6; 11-14 help us make better sense of  Romans 8:29,30?
保罗指出神预知我们并拣选我们。这些话一直让很多人难以理解。以弗所书1:3-6，11-14如何帮我们理解罗马书8:29，30？
Read 2 Peter 3:16 and 1 Peter 1:10,11. 读彼得后书3:16 和彼得前书 1 :10，11
1.      How these sections encourage us to search patiently the whole context of Scripture in order to understand difficult passages?
这些章节怎样鼓励我们耐心地查找圣经上下文，从而明白难懂的段落？
2.      Sometimes Christians may have different opinions on what a passage means. Sometimes we can have differences of opinion. However, all opinions must pass certain tests:
有时基督徒们对一段经文有不同理解。有时我们持不同意见，但是，所有意见必须经过一定的测试。
They must never confuse law and gospel. 这些意见不能混淆律法和福音。
They must be based on a completely logical understanding of the text. 这些意见必须基于对原文完全合乎逻辑的理解。
They must never contradict any statement of Scripture. 这些意见不能和经文有任何矛盾。
The reasons for the interpretation must come from Scripture itself. 解释经文的理由必须来自圣经本身。
The interpretation must say nothing other than what Scripture says in other places. 这些解释不能与圣经的其他部分相异。
Whenever a Bible section is hard to understand, we must always let the main spots in the Bible where this subject is discussed help us interpret them in a God-pleasing way.
任何时候遇到难以解读的圣经部分，我们必须总是让圣经中有所根据的主要部分，帮助我们以神喜悦的方式理解。
Summary 总结
When you study Scripture, allow Scripture to interpret itself. Pay special attention to the immediate context of the verse under study. But realize that the verse may best be understood in the light of other passages of Scripture. In the case of passages that don't readily reveal their meaning, proceed patiently. Grow in a knowledge of God's Word; rule out wrong interpretations that go against clear teachings of Scripture; discover other portions of Scripture that may offer clues.
当你学习圣经，要以经解经。特别关注所学章节紧密联接的上下文。意识到要最好的理解经文应根据圣经其他段落。在段落不能马上揭示意思的情况下，耐心地继续下去。在神的话语里成长；去除与圣经中清楚教义相左的错误解释；从圣经中其他部分找到线索。
Introduction 介绍
Think again of how you read a newspaper. If you read a story about how your state legislature is acting on a bill to improve the highway near your home, how are you going to interpret the story? Or if you read, "The stock market has gone up 50 points," how will you handle the individual words in that sentence?
In many ways interpreting the Bible is very simple. If we read the Bible as we instinctively read the newspaper, we will understand the Bible as God intends it to be understood. In this and the next lesson, we will be looking at how the Bible writers use words. We call this the grammatical setting of Scripture.
This lesson is really only an extension of what we learned last week. We let Scripture interpret Scripture. The context of Scripture itself will help us understand how we are to interpret its words.
再想想你如何读报纸。如果你读到关于你们州立法机关要实施一项法案来改善你家附近的高速公路，你将如何解释这件事呢？或者你读到"股市已上升50点，"你如何用自己的话表达这个句子呢？
很多解释圣经的方法很简单。如果我们读圣经就像我们读报纸那样凭直觉，我们的理解就能符合神想要传达的意思。在这节和下节课，我们要看看圣经作者如何用词。我们称此为圣经的文法设定。
这节课仅是上星期我们所学的延伸。我们让圣经自己解释经文。圣经的上下文会帮助我们理解如何解释它的话。
Studying God's Word学习神的话语
Look carefully at the meanings of words and how they are used 仔细看神的话的意思和它们的用法。
The Bible was not written in an unintelligible code to be deciphered by some magical formula. Those who read the Bible do not need to read into, beyond, or between words for some "deeper" or other-than-normal meaning.
圣经不是用难以破译的密码写的，不需要神秘的公式去解密。读圣经不用在字里行间找隐蔽很深或是非同寻常的意思。
For example, a journalist travels to India and writes a news report about a terrible famine that is afflicting the country. When people read his article back home, he wants them to interpret his words to mean (choose one):
比如，一个记者去印度写一个关于这个国家受可怕的饥荒折磨的新闻报道。当人们读他的文章，他想让他们明白他的话的意思（选一句）:
a)      that the people of India are experiencing a great intellectual hunger.
印度人民正经历巨大智力饥荒。
b)      that the people of India have good appetites.
印度人民胃口很好。
c)      that the writer is predicting a famine sometime in India's future.
作者预测印度将来有场饥荒。
d)     that the people's souls in India desperately need the gospel of Christ.
印度人民的灵魂渴慕基督的福音。
e)      that the people of India are physically hungry due to a lack of food supply in the country.
印度人民因缺乏食物供应正经受饥荒。
How can you be sure of your interpretation?
你怎样确信你的解释是正确的呢？
We must take care to understand the meanings of the words Scripture uses. The work of interpreting the Greek words in the original text into English falls largely into the laps of translators. Those using a translation should be sure they are using a faithful translation, one that conveys the original words and sentences clearly and accurately.
我们理解圣经使用的词语时要特别小心。将圣经原文中的希腊词汇译成英文的翻译者可随己意而行。那些使用翻译本圣经的人就要明确其使用的是可靠的，能清楚、正确传达圣经原著词句的译本。
As you read your English Bible, be sure you understand every word. As with any reading, if you don't understand a word, it will be difficult to interpret the section. Consult a dictionary if you need help.
当你读英文圣经，确信你理解每个词语。就像你读任何书，如果你有词语不明白，你就很难理解一段。如需帮助，可以使用字典。
There are times, however, when a word may have several meanings and you must choose which one is correct. We already looked at one instance where the word world carries two different meanings.
有时，一个词可能有几个意思，你必须选择一个正确的。我们已经看到一个例子，世界这个词带有两种不同意义。
Read Matthew 1:19, Luke 1:6, and Galatians 3:11. 读马太福音1:19  路加福音 1:6 加拉太书 3:11。
1.      The word righteous (translated upright in Luke 1) has two different meanings in these verses. What are they?
"正义的"这个词（在路加福音中译为正直的）在这些章节里有两种不同意思。是什么？
2.      How does the context help you understand how the word is used?
上下文如何帮你理解该词的使用？
Read Luke 15:32. 读路加福音15:32。
The word dead is obviously not used here in the sense of physical death. How do we know?
死亡这个词在这里显然不是指身体死亡。我们怎么知道的？
In order to be sure you understand clearly how Luke uses this word, you decide to use a concordance. When you look up the word death, you find these passages. Which of them speak of physical death? In which of them is the context similar to that in the story of the prodigal son?
为了确信你清楚理解路加如何使用这个词，你决定进行词汇索引（书籍等中按字母顺序排列的词汇索引）。你查找死亡这个词，你找到这些段落。他们哪个是讲身体死亡？哪个上下文与浪子回头的故事相似？
1.      Matthew 28:7-He has risen from the dead. 马太福音 28:/---他从死中复活。
2.      Romans 6:23-The wages of sin is death. 罗马书 6:23----罪的工价是死。
3.      Romans 8:10-Your body is dead because of sin. 罗马书   8:19----因为罪你们的身体是死的。
4.      Ephesians 2:1-You were dead in your transgressions. 以弗所书  2:1-----你们死在过犯罪恶中。
5.      Thessalonians 4:16-And the dead in Christ will rise first. 帖撒罗尼迦 4:16----那在基督里死的人必先复活。
Look carefully at the words the Bible writers use. Let the context help you arrive at the correct meaning. Examine how the word is used in the wider context of Scripture.
仔细察看圣经作者使用的词语。联系上下文帮你到达正确的意思。在圣经广泛的上下文中去查看词语是如何使用的。
Look carefully at the kind of writing the author is using 仔细思考作者写作的文体种类
The interpreter of Scripture must always be aware of the kind of writing the Bible writer is using. Again, this is nothing different than we do every day when we read nonbiblical writing. We are sensitive to whether we are reading a prose narrative or poetry or a story that looks like narrative but which the author has made up to illustrate some truth.
圣经翻译家必须知道圣经作者的写作种类。这与我们每天读非圣经作品没什么不同。我们对所读的文体很敏感，是散文，是诗歌，或是比喻（看似叙述故事，实则是阐明故事中隐含的真理）。
Below is a list of the main kinds (the technical term is genre) of literature we find in Scripture. The descriptions are taken from Biblical Interpretation: The Only Right Way, by David Kuske, pages 83 and 84.
以下是一系列我们在圣经中发现的主要文体种类（专业术语称为文学体裁）。这些文学体裁的描叙来自《圣经的翻译:唯一正确道路》  作者:大卫 库斯克 （David Kuske）， 83 和84 页
Narrative is the statement of historical data. The reader is given a report of such things as what took place, at what time, who was involved, where, and why.
叙述文 是历史性资料的陈述。读者得知事情怎样发生，什么时间，涉及谁，地点和原因。
1.      Locate some sections of narrative. 查找一些叙述文的章节。
2.      Why is it important to know that a certain section of Scripture is narrative? 为什么知道某些圣经章节是叙述性的很重要？
Poetry is characterized by several kinds of parallelism. The second part of a line (or second line) will explain, expand on, or contrast with the first part of the line (or the preceding line).
诗 以几种对应句式为特征。第二行对第一行 （或后一行对前一行）进行解 释，扩展，对比。
1.      Locate some sections of poetry. 查找一些诗句段落。
2.      Why is it important to know that a certain section of Scripture is written as poetry? 为什么知道某些圣经章节是以诗的形式写成的很重 要？
Epistles are letters written to churches or individuals. They have a distinct structure (as in letters we write). They also have a distinct historical context, which must be taken into account. (More about the historical setting in lesson five.)
使徒书信 是写给教会或个人的信。它们结构清楚（就如我 们写的信）。它们还有清楚的历史背景，必 须考虑进去。（在第五课更多关于历史背景）
1.      Locate some epistles. 查找使徒书信。
2.      Why is it important to be able to recognize epistles? 为什么区分出使徒书信很重要？
Prophecy-teaching is a general term for the declaration and explanation of spiritual truths. Bible writers convict people of sin, declare God's plan of salvation in Christ, and urge their readers to embrace and cling to the grace of God by faith.
预言式教导是宣告和解释神的属灵真道的体裁的统称。圣经作者让人们知罪，宣告神在基督里的救赎计划，督促读者凭信心信奉和依靠 神的恩典。
1.      Locate some examples of prophecy-teaching. 查找关于预言式教导的例子
2.      Why is it important to know that a certain section of Scripture is prophecy-teaching? 为什么知道圣经有些是预言式教导很重要？
Apocalypse is characterized by fantastic imagery. Often, as in much of Revelation, entire chapters comprise a vision made up of symbols.
启示 充满奇异的象征意义。多用在启示录中，整个篇章包含充满象征的异象。
1.      Locate some examples of apocalypse. 查找属于启示的例子。
2.      Why is it important to know that a certain section of Scripture is apocalypse? 为什么知道圣经中有些部分是启示很重要？
Look carefully at the kind of literature you are reading. Most often the context will help you decide.
仔细体会你读的各种文体。多数情况下上下文会帮你判读断。
Summary 总结
Be sure you know what words mean; use your dictionary when you don't. Let the context of Scripture help you discover the meaning of words that can carry more than one meaning. When you interpret, be sensitive to the kind of literature you are reading.
确信你明确圣经话语的意思，不确信时使用字典。让圣经的上下文帮助你理解多义词在文中的意思。解释经文时，要注意辨别所读的是何种文体。
Prayer: Dear Lord, we come to you as simple people, simple in the sense that by nature we cannot understand your great plans for the world and for us. Yet you have revealed them to us in your Word. You have made wise our simple minds and led us to know about our Savior and grow in faith. We come before you today with minds that are open to your Word. Help us approach your Word with God-pleasing methods of interpretation and receive all the insight you want us to have. Amen.
祷告: 亲爱的主，我们作为普通人来到你面前，智力平常，我们的本性使我们不能明白您对这个世界，对我们的伟大计划。然而您的话语向我们宣示它们。您赋予我们智 慧，让我们知道救主，在信心里成长。今天我们来到您面前，心思向您的话语敞开。帮助我们用您喜悦的方式来解释和理解您的话，并领悟洞察您的话。Amen。
Introduction 介绍
The Bible is full of figurative or picture language. People in Bible times loved to draw pictures in the reader's mind. Even today the people in the Middle East speak, write, and think a lot of picture language.
圣经充满比喻和图像化语言。在圣经年代，人们喜欢在读者心中描绘图画。即使今天在中东，人们仍以很多图像化的语言说话，写文章和思考。
Look at Psalm 119:105. Did you have any trouble understanding the picture language David used? How does using picture language actually help us understand the Bible's point better?
看诗篇119:105。你理解大卫王使用的语言有问题吗？使用图像化的语言如何帮你更好地理解圣经的观点？
Bible writers use many different kinds of picture language. All of them have this in common: they use something we know to explain something we don't know.
圣经作者使用许多不同的图像语言。他们有个共同之处就是用我们知道的东西来解释我们不知道的东西。
Let's look at some ways the Bible uses picture language. 让我们看看几种圣经中使用的图像语言。
Studying God's Word 学习神的话
Making sense of uncomplicated picture language 明白意思简单的图像语言
We use brief, uncomplicated picture language often in our day-to-day conversations. Most of the time it is easy to notice them. Work through these examples. They show why it is important to see whether a writer is using a word to make picture language. What do the italicized words mean in the passages below?
我们日常生活中常用简洁明了的图像化语言。多数情况它们容易被注意到。学习这些例子。他们表明为什么知道作者是否使用图像语言很重要？以下章节里斜体字是什么意思？
Genesis 1:5 There was evening, and there was morning-the first day.
创世纪1:5   有早晨，有晚上，这是第一日
Psalm 18:2 The Lord is my rock.
诗篇 18:2   神是我的基石
2 Kings 2:11 Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
列王纪下 2:11以利亚就乘旋风上天去了

How can you tell if the author is using picture language? Here are three principles to consider:
如何辨别作者是使用图像语言？有三条原则可以考虑。
1.      Always take the normal meaning of a word or words unless the Bible section is obviously talking about something different.
总是选用词的标准意义，除非经文明显要表达不同意思。
2        Understand the words as picture language if the writer shows that he wants them to be understood that way. Look up Luke 10:3 and Matthew 13:24 for examples.
按照作者使用图像语言的意图去理解。查看路加福音10:3 ，马太福音13:24
3.      Understand the words as picture language if the context shows they're supposed to be understood that way. See John 15:5 and Matthew 5:13 for examples.
按照上下文宣示如果是以图像语言，就按图像语言去理解 。看约翰福音15:5  马太福音5:13
Below are examples of simple one or two-word picture language.
以下是一些一个词或两个词表达的图像语言。
1.      "Their feet rush into sin" (Proverbs 1:16). Actually it wasn't just their feet but their whole bodies."
他们的脚奔跑行恶 "（ 箴言1:16）实际上不是他们的脚而是他们的整个身体。
2.       "How was the exam?" A student answers, "Simple!  Simple!" Yet the tone of his voice indicates that he really means the exam was difficult.
"考的怎么样？"一个学生回答。"简单！简单！"但是他的语气宣示他意思是考试很难。
3.      "My people have been lost sheep" (Jeremiah 50:6). "  我的百姓做了迷失的羊"（耶利米书50:6）
4.      "All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears" (Psalm 6:6).
"每夜我流泪，将床榻漂起，将褥子湿透"诗篇 6: 6）
5.      "All men are like grass" (1 Peter 1:24).
"凡有血气的，尽都如草"（彼得前书 1:24）
6.      "If God is for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31).
" 如果神帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们？"(罗马书8:31）
7.      "The White House today reported . . . ," when actually the president or one of his aides reported.
"白宫今天报道......，"实际上是总统或他的属下报道。
8.      "The mountains and hills will burst into song" (Isaiah 55:12).
"大山小山一起歌唱"（以塞亚书55:12)
Now try picking out and explaining the word pictures in these passages:
现在试着找出并解释这些章节里图像化的词。

Bible writers use picture language. As in normal writing, the context will decide whether we are to understand something literally or as picture language..
圣经作者用图像语言，和一般作品一样，其上下文决定我们按照字面意义理解还是按图像语言理解。
Understanding parables 理解比喻
The word parable comes from the Greek para ("beside or alongside") and ballein ("to throw"). A parable is a story that is thrown alongside the truth to illustrate the truth.
比喻一词来自希腊文para( 在旁边)和ballein(扔)， 比喻原意就是一个故事扔在真理旁边用来揭示该真理。
A parable is just more detailed picture language. When you run into a parable, keep this in mind:
比喻就是使用更详细具体的图像语言。当你碰到比喻，要记住这点:
Jesus told a parable to make one simple point. Making sense of that parable means understanding the one point Jesus is trying to make. Use the context to help you decide what it is.
耶稣讲一个比喻来表达一个要点。要明白比喻，就要弄清楚耶稣用这个比喻表明的要点是什么。运用上下文帮助你判断。
Don't think the parable is trying to make a whole bunch of points. The many details of the story Jesus told are to help us understand the main point He's trying to make.
不要以为比喻是要表达一堆观点。耶稣讲的故事中的很多细节是帮助我们明白他要表达的要点。
Practice finding the main point of these parables. Figure out which details are meant to be explained and which are not.
练习找出这些比喻的要点。弄清哪些细节是需要解释，哪些不是。
Matthew 13:1-9,18-23-The parable of the sower and the seed.  马太福音 13:1-9，18-23-----撒种的比喻。
Matthew 21:33-39-The parable of the tenants.  马太福音 21:33-39-----园主的比喻。
Luke 16:1-13-The parable of the shrewd manager.  路加16:1-13----精明的管家的比喻。
When you try to understand  parables, first find the main point Jesus is making. Concentrate  only on those details that support the main point.
当你试着理解比喻时，首先找到耶稣要表达的要点。专注于支持要点的那些细节。
Making sense of actual pictures the Bible paints 弄清圣经描绘的确切画面。
The Bible paints different pictures for us to remind us of something important. The best example of a symbol is a cross.
圣经为我们给我们描绘不同画面，提醒我们重要的东西。十字架就是最好的象征符号的例子。
What symbol did God come up with in Genesis 9:12-17?
神在创世纪9:12-17 节中提出的象征符号是什么？
There are a lot of these kinds of pictures in the book of Revelation. Daniel and Ezekiel also use many symbols.
在启示录里有很多这样的画面。但以理书和以西结书也使用很多象征。
Read Revelation 1:20. Also refer to 1:12-16. 读启示录1:20。还有1:12-16
What are the two pictures the Bible tells us about in this verse? What do they picture?
在这节中圣经描绘了两幅画面是什么？它们描绘了什么？
Scripture is filled with symbols, or pictures, that remind us of something. Most often we can find the meaning of symbols from the wider context of Scripture.
圣经充满象征，图像，给我们提醒。大多数情况下我们可以联系广泛的上下文发现象征的意思。
Summary 总结
The Bible is full of picture language. There are one-word, uncomplicated picture words.  There is more complicated stories Jesus told to picture things for us. Sometimes the Bible paints actual pictures to remind us of important things. The Holy Spirit uses the human language to bring a variety of pictures and emotions into our minds. We need to be careful when we try to explain this picture language. Look for the one main point the word or section is trying to describe for us. Be careful not to read too much into especially the parables.
圣经充满图像语言。有一个词的、简单的图像语言，有耶稣为我们描绘的更复杂的比喻式的图像语言。有时圣经为我们描绘真实画面，提醒我们重要的东西。圣灵运用 人类语言在我们的心里产生各种画面和情感。当我们解释图像语言时要小心。寻找词和段中要向我们表达的要点。要小心不要过分解读比喻的细节。
Introduction 介绍
People who are serious about letting God speak through the Bible read it with an open mind. They let the Bible explain itself. The method that does the best job of this is called "the historical-grammatical method" of understanding the Bible.
In the last two lessons, we have studied what it means to look at the Bible as a grammatical book. Like any other book it contains words and sentences and different kinds of writing styles. The more we understand these different kinds of writing styles, the better we understand what God is saying in the Bible. That's the "grammatical" part of using the "historical-grammatical method."
Today we look at the "historical" side of Scripture interpretation. The more we understand the actual, historical events the Bible tells about, the better we will understand what God's saying.
那些认真地听神通过圣经说话的人读圣经，心思是敞开的。他们让圣经解释圣经。这个最好的方式被称为理解圣经的"历史语法方法"。
在上面两节课，我们已经学了为何把圣经看成一本语法书。和任何其他书一样，它包括词，句子，不同的写作风格。我们越能理解不同的风格，我们越能理解神在圣经里说的话。这就是使用"历史语法方法"的语法部分。
今天我们看圣经解释的"历史的"部分。我们越清楚圣经讲述的真实的历史事件，我们越理解神的话。
Studying God's Word 学习神的话
Why we must see the Bible has an actual, historical background
为什么我们必须明白圣经有真实的，历史背景？
Anytime anyone writes anything, they write as part of an actual culture during an actual time in history.
任何时间任何人写任何东西，他们写的是在真实的历史年代里的真实文化的一部分。
Would you be able to understand a famous saying that isn't part of the Bible without knowing when the speaker lived or under what conditions he spoke?
不知道讲话人的生活年代，不清楚其所处历史情况，便不能成其为圣经，你能理解这句名言吗？
1.      A man by the name of Patrick Henry once said, "Give me liberty or give me death." What did Patrick Henry mean by liberty?
一个叫帕特里克，亨利的人曾说"要不给我自由，要不给我死亡。"他所指的"自由"是什么意思？
release from jail 从监狱释放
the Statue of Liberty 自由女神
financial freedom 财产自由
freedom from slavery 从奴隶制解放
political freedom from the tyranny of other governments 从其他政府暴政得到政治自由
2.      What background information did you have to know to get that answer?
要给出答案你需要什么背景信息？
Here's a story that shows someone completely leaving the Bible's historical background out of his Bible study.
下面的故事关于一个人完全脱离圣经历史背景学习圣经。
A person needed some direction in his life. The best way to do this, he thought, was to let the Lord guide him using the Bible. He decided to open the Bible to any spot, place his finger on a passage, and follow the advice.
He opened his Bible, and the first passage he laid his finger on was Matthew 27:5, "Then [Judas] went away and hanged himself."
"That can't be right," he thought to himself, "I'd better try again." Again he let his Bible open to whatever section it wanted to and read the passage his finger came to rest on, Luke 10:37, where Jesus says, "Go and imitate his example."
When he tried a third time, the Bible verse his finger came down on was John 13:27, where he read Jesus saying, "Hurry! Do what you have to do."
一个需要找生活方向的人。他觉得最好的办法是让神用圣经给他指导。他决定打开圣经任何一处，把手指放到那页，就跟从那个旨意。
他打开圣经，第一次它的手指落在马太福音27:5，"然后犹大走开，上吊了。"
"那不可能，"他想，"我最好再试。"他再次任意打开圣经，读他手指停留的章节，路加福音10:37，耶稣说"你去照样行吧。"
当他试第三次，他的手指落到约翰福音13:27，他读到耶稣说"快！做你必须做的"
What mistake in the way he studied the Bible could have caused him big problems?
他学习圣经的方式出了什么错本可以给他造成大问题？
Think back to the basic principle of making sense of the Bible: Let Scripture interpret Scripture. How did this man fail to do this?
回顾理解圣经的基本原则:以经解经。这个人怎么没能做到？
Here are some examples that make the same point we are working on today.
下面是些和我们今天要继续学习的持同样观点的例子
Read John 10:16. 读约翰福音10:16
1.      What did Jesus mean by other sheep? 1. 耶稣所指的其他的羊是么意思？
the Old Testament Israelites in the wilderness 旧约旷野里的以色列民
a flock of sheep on a six-acre ranch Jesus owned just outside of Capernaum  耶稣拥有的6英亩牧场上的一群羊
people of the Western Hemisphere 西半球的人们
people in heaven 天国的人
all those outside of Judaism-Gentiles 所有的非犹太人----外邦人
2.      How did you arrive at your answer?  你怎么得出你的答案？
Read Deuteronomy 15:1. 读申命记15:1
How does the historical background for this Bible section help us better understand this passage?
这部分圣经的历史背景如何帮你理解这节？
Read Deuteronomy 14:22. 读申命记 14:22
How does the historical background for this Bible section help us better understand this passage?
这部分圣经的历史背景如何帮你理解这节？
Read Exodus 20:8-11 and Colossians 2:16,17. 读出埃及记 20:8-11 和 歌罗西书 2:16，17
1.      How does the Bible's historical background put the Exodus passage in its proper perspective?
圣经的历史背景如何帮助我们正确看待这段出埃及记章节？
2.      How does the Missionary Paul in his letter put the Exodus passage in its proper perspective?
传教士保罗在书信中如何正确看待这段出埃及记章节？
Read Philippians 1:20-26. Compare this with 2 Timothy 4:6-8. 阅读腓立比书 1:20-26。和提摩太后书 4:6-8 作比较
How does knowing the historical background of Philippians and 2 Timothy help us make sense of these verses?
知道腓立比书和提摩太后书的历史背景如何帮助我们理解这些章节？
Understanding who is speaking, to whom, where, when, and why will help us hear exactly what God is saying and put it in to use in our lives the right way.
知道是谁在说，对谁说，地点，时间，原因将帮助我们准确听到神说的话并正确运用到生活中。
It takes work to understand the Bible in its historical background  要花工夫来理解圣经的历史背景
The Bible contains all the history we need to understand it in its historical background. The better we get to know the Bible, the better we will be able to interpret it.
Look up Psalm 105. How well can you make sense of following phrases from that Psalm:
圣经包含了我们要清楚其历史背景的所有历史。我们越了解圣经，就越能更好地解释。
看诗篇105。下面这篇诗篇中的句子你有多清楚？
"tell of all his wonderful acts" (verse 2) "谈论他的奇妙作为"（第2句）
"when they were but few in number" (verse 12) "当时他们人数稀少 " （第12句）
"they wandered" (verse 13) "他们徘徊"（第13句）
"do my prophets no harm" (verse 15) "不可恶待我的先知" （第15句）
Discuss how the following kinds of Bible study will help you understand the Bible better:
讨论以下各种学习圣经的方式如何帮你更好理解圣经？
A 24-lesson overview study of the whole Bible. 一个包括24课的整本圣经的概括学习。
A study of the book of Acts. 学习使徒行传
A study of the rules for living God gave Moses and the people of Israel. 学习神给摩西和以色列民的生活规则。
A study of the history of the kings of Israel and Judah. 学习以色列和犹太的王的历史。
To understand the Bible well, it's important to have a good grasp of the whole Bible. This helps a person understand different things it says, whether what it's saying applies to him or her and how we should use it in our everyday lives.
为了很好地理解圣经，深刻了解整本圣经很重要。这帮助一个人理解圣经说的不同事情，这些事情是否适用应用于他或她，及应如何在日常生活中正确运用。
Use and misuse of background material not found in the Bible as we struggle to understand Scripture
当我们努力理解圣经时，使用和误用圣经上没有的背景材料
As we've studied, we've heard over and over again, "Let the Bible explain itself." Is it ever right to use information we've gotten from places outside the Bible to help us understand Scripture?
正如我们已学的，我们一遍又一遍听到"让圣经自己做解释"。使用圣经以外的信息来帮助我们理解圣经对吗？
Think over these examples: 考虑这些例子:
Your friend Susan came to Bible study last week with an article on ancient farming methods. The class was studying Jesus' story about the farmer planting his seed.
你的朋友苏珊上星期带一篇关于古代耕作方法的文章来学圣经。这节课要学习耶稣讲的农民播种的故事。
1.      How could the class use this information in their study?
如何在这节课中使用这个信息呢？
Another friend, John, ran across an interesting article on the city of Jericho. Recent archaeological work there gives us interesting details about the size and layout of the city. It also uncovers evidence that shows that at one point in history, the walls of Jericho seem to have fallen outward.
另一个朋友，约翰，碰到一篇有趣的文章关于城市耶利哥。最近那的考古工作给我们提供关于城市的大小和布局的有趣的细节。还发现证据表明历史上耶利哥的城墙曾经向外坍塌。
2.      How might this information be helpful? 这个信息会有什么帮助？
3.      How might this information be misused? 这个信息怎样会被误用？
Background information not found in the Bible, whether it is historical background or background about the way a Bible word is used, can help a Bible section be more understandable. We must never use this kind of information, though, to change the simple meaning the Bible is communicating.
圣经里没有的背景信息，无论是历史背景，或是关于一句圣经的话使用的背景，能让圣经段落易于理解。我们决不使用这种信息，去改变圣经要传达的简单意义。
Summary 总结
The Bible's message does not change depending on what time in history you live or what kind of culture. Yet the Bible was written during actual historical periods and as part of actual cultures in which people lived. Knowing who wrote a book, when it was written, to whom certain words were spoken, and why they were spoken will help Bible readers. The better they understand these details, the more they will understand a Bible section correctly and use its unchanging message in their daily lives.
圣经的信息不会以你生活的年代的历史或文化而改变。然而，圣经是在真实的历史时期写成，并作为人们生活的真实的文化的一部分。 知道谁写的书，什么时间写的，哪些话是对哪些人说的，为什么说这些话，会帮助圣经读者。他们越了解细节，越能正确理解圣经章节，并将永恒的信息运用在他们 的日常生活。
