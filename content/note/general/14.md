Our Dilemma
我们的困境 – 上帝的解决方法


I. 人类的困境:
alt“所以你们要完全，象你们的天父完全一样。” 马太福音 5:48
“因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了　神的荣耀。” 罗马书 3:23
“因为凡遵守全律法的，只在一条上跌倒，他就是犯了众条。”  雅各书 2:10
“因为罪的工价乃是死；” 罗马书 6:23a




II. 人为的解救方法:
 alt                                                                                                                                              
                         alt                             alt
加倍努力                                                       平衡术                                                                   比较


III.      上帝的解决方法:

alt“神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。”
约翰福音 3:16
“神使那无罪的(“无罪”原文作“不知罪”)，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为　神的义。”
哥林多后书 5:21
“惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，　神的爱就在此向我们显明了。”  罗马书 5:8
“惟有　神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。” 罗马书 6:23b


  上帝的公义                                                                                         上帝的爱
                      alt

                                               G    =   God’s 上帝的
                                               R    =   Riches 丰盛
                                               A    =   At    以
                                               C    =   Christ’s 基督为
                                               E    =   Expense代价
恩惠（Grace） =上帝的丰盛，这丰盛乃是以基督为代价的(God’s riches at Christ’s expense)
“如今那些在基督耶稣里的，就不定罪了。” 罗马书 8:1
IV. 我们的回应:

“不是我们爱　神，乃是　神爱我们，差他的儿子为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。 亲爱的弟兄啊，　神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。 ”约翰一书 4:10-11
alt

基督徒对上帝爱的信息（他的话语）的回应是赞美和侍奉                                
     1.          P. （praise 赞美）= 在敬拜和我们每天的生活中赞美神。                                  
  2.          S.（serve 侍奉）= 在言行上来服事别人

有关在我们生活中的应用的两个问题:
     1.  如果今晚你就要死了，你能够确定你已经得到永生了吗？
如果上帝问你，“为什么我要让你进入天堂呢?”你会怎么回答他？
请看罗马书 6:23， 将这句经文写在下面。
alt“信子的人有永生；”约翰福音 3:36

1．如果你今晚就要死的话，你是否确信你有永生？
2．如果神问你，我为什么要让你进天堂呢？你怎么回答？

“信子(耶稣)的人有永生” 约3:36





                                                         解说：   Explanation of Our Dilemma---God’s solution
                                                                                       我们的困境---神的办法

Permit me now to put a little flesh on to this outline, sharing with you what I may have said or added as we “discussed” this Law and Gospel presentation. I would seek comment and input from the listener in all points along the way. It was offered more as a dialogue than a monologue. It is a presentation that could be made with or without a printed outline. It could be made in as little as ten minutes or as long as a full hour, depending on the circumstances and time available.
在我们一起“讨论”有关律法和恩典这个题目时，请允许我给这个大纲添加一些充实的内容。我也喜欢大家随时补充或做出评论。所以，这不是一个人的独白，而是对话。在展示这个内容时，大纲可有可无。我们会根据情况，把它限制在10分钟之内，或展开到1个小时。

First, as to the title： Our Dilemma-God’s Solution，the “our” includes everybody. I didn’t use Man’s or Mankind’s Dilemma since it includes men, women and children.
I chose the word “dilemma” because I wasn’t sure I knew how to spell it (and so I had to check it out---research is always good) and because it was not a word that was common in the Grenadian vocabulary. I always gave them a few guesses as to what it meant. Some would get it but most did not.
首先，我们来看一下题目：我们的困境和神的解决办法。其中的“我们”包括每一个人。我没有用“人”或“人类的困境”，因为它包括男女老少。我选择“困境”这个词时，查了字典，因为我不能肯定怎样拼写它，还因为这个词在格林纳达的词汇中不常见。我也经常让人一起来猜它的意思。有的人会说对，但多数说不对。

A dilemma, I would tell them, is a problem, a big problem and, in fact, so big a problem that it is impossible for us to solve, even though we may “try hard.” I would then illustrate a dilemma in this way. Grenada is a small Island surrounded by vast oceans. I would first of all ask if the person was a good swimmer. I would receive a variety of answer: “yes”---“I’m okay”---or “no, I don’t go near the water or I’m afraid of it.” I might ask if they could swim from one end of Grand Anse Beach to the other. Some said they could. How about from Grenada to Carricaou? “No, never!” Okay, let’s say you were in a small row boat in the middle of the ocean, a thousand miles away from the nearest land and you don’t even know in which direction the land lies. You have no motor no oars, no food and no water. You are all by yourself. That is a dilemma. What is going to happen to you? Most times, reluctantly, they would say, “I’m going to die.”
我会告诉他们，“困境”是一个问题，一个大问题，而且事实上，大得我们不可能解决。即使我们可能会“努力再努力”但还是无济于事。 接着，我会用这样的方式加以解释。格林纳达是一个被大海包围的小岛。我会先问这个人是不是个游泳高手。然后我会听到各种各样的回答：“是的”---“我还行”—或者“不，我都不敢走近水，或我害怕。” 我会问他们是否能从大安斯海湾的一头游到另一头。一些人会说他们可以。那从格林纳达游到加力卡乌怎样呢？“不行，绝不可能！”我们就假设你在大海中央，驾着一条小船，离最近的陆地有一千英里。此时，你根本不知道陆地在哪个方向，你没有马达，没有船桨，没有食物，没有水，而你是独自一人。这就是困境！你会怎样？多数时候，他们会不情愿地说，我会死掉！

I would then proceed to show that we are confronted with an even worse dilemma in our relationship with God because of sin. Isaiah 59:2 declares: “But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.”
 We would proceed to look at the passages under Our Dilemma one by one, having them read it with me if they had paper in hand. We would then briefly ask the good Lutheran question, “What does this mean?” What exactly is this passage saying about us and our relationship with God?
然后我就开始让他们看到一个我们因为罪而在与神的关系上遇到的一个更糟糕的困境。以赛亚书59：2说：“但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝。你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。”
然后我们会一起读“我们的困境”里的每一条经文，同时问：“这是什么意思？”　这些经文论到我们和神的关系方面到底在说什么？

In Matthew 5:48, the Lord says, “Be perfect,”---not try to be perfect, or become perfect eventually, but BE Perfect right now and forever. I would then ask, “How many perfect people are here right now?” “None, pasta,” would be their quick response. Indeed none, although I would kiddingly say, “Are you including me? Yes, pasta.’ Look at the next passage. What does it say? “All have sinned---“. How many? ---a few, some, many? No, all! “Falling short of the glory of God” is just another way of saying that we are imperfect, sinful human beings, we have fallen short of the perfect-ness that God and His holiness requires of us to enter into His presence.
在马太福音5：48节中，神说：“你们要完全，”---不是努力完全，或最终达到完全，而是现在以及永远要完全/完美！然后我会问：“这里有多少完美的人？”“一个也没有，牧师！”他们会很快回答。确实一个也没有，不过，我还会开玩笑地说：“也包括我吗？”“是的，牧师！” 看看下一段经文怎么说。它在说什么？“世人都犯了罪---”多少人？---几个？一些？很多？不，是所有的人！“亏缺了神的荣耀”只是在用另一种方式说：我们不完美，我们是有罪的人，我们缺少神以及他的圣洁所要求的完美，所以我们不能进到他的面前。

Now look at James2:10 and notice what it says. (Read it together.) We talk about basically the Ten Commandments and also about the letter (Thou shalt not kill) and the spirit (Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer.) of the Law and then point out that God’s Word says that if we break just one commandment out of ten (just one time) we are guilty of sin. One sin makes me a sinner just as one lie makes me a liar.
 The bottom line for our sin and our terrible dilemma in our relationship with God is spelled out black on white in Romans 6:23 “The wages of sin---“ I would pause and let them say from memory or from reading say, “is death.” And that means not just physically death but eternal damnation and eternal separation from God.
现在看雅各2：10，注意它在说什么？（一起读）我们基本上是在讨论十诫和律法中的话(不可杀人),以及其中的精义(凡恨他弟兄的就是杀了他.), 然后指出,神的话说,如果我们犯了十条诫命中的一条(就一次),我们就有罪了。一条罪会让一个人成为罪人，就像一个谎言会让一个人成为说谎者。
我们的罪，以及我们和神关系上的困境有一个最后底线，白纸黑字地记在罗6：23 “罪的工价乃是---”我会停下让他们说，“是死。”它的意思不仅是身体上的死亡，而且是永远的沉沦地狱，永远与神隔绝。

This is a dilemma---isn’t it? And it’s our dilemma, it’s the world’s dilemma in our relationship with God!
Now most people, when faced with a dilemma, a serious problem, what do they do? They try to fix it, to resolve it, to make it better again. That’s what people also try to do with their broken relationship with God. That is the essence of “natural religion” in this world and the foundation of every religion of the world. They try to fix it by: TRYING HARDER! And yet trying harder to live the perfect life which God requires by His Law is like trying to lift yourself up by your own boot straps. Have you ever tried that? It cannot be done.  You may try harder than anybody else in the world but you will not budge yourself one fraction of an inch off the ground by yourself.
这是个困境---是不是？而且这是我们的困境，是我们和神的关系上的一个世界大难题！
大多数人在面对困境、一个严重问题时，他们是怎么做的？他们努力去修补，设法解决，使它好转。在人和神破坏了的关系问题上，人们也这么做。这就是世界上“自然宗教”和一切宗教的基础和本质。他们想通过“再努力些！”的方式加以修补。然而，更加努力地去过神的律法所要求的完美生活，就像是在抓着自己的鞋带想把自己提起来。你试过吗？根本不行。你可以比世界上任何人都更努力，但你却不能让自己从地面上移动一分一毫。

Time and time again I have run into people who are “trying harder” and they are driving themselves bananas. For just when you think you are making a little progress, what happens?  They fail again. “Try harder” ultimately only leads to frustration and failure and generally results in people giving up on “religion.”
Here is another point. Even if you could succeed living a perfect life for the rest of your life from this point on, what about your past life of imperfection? Do you expect a righteous and holy judge to just forget about your past? Would you expect a judge in the human court of law to just excuse your past life of abuse? Your past convicts you and your present condemns you no matter how many pious appeals and promises you make for trying harder or doing better in the future. “Be Perfect” is God’s unchanging demands and commands!
我经常遇到“再努力一些”的人。他们快把自己逼疯了。因为当你正想你有了一点进步时，发生什么了？又不行了。“再努力些”的方法最终只会以挫折和失败结束，也通常让人对“宗教”不抱希望。
从另一点上讲，即使你从现在开始能成功地过一个完美的生活，那以前的不完美呢？你想让一个公义圣洁的法官干脆忘掉你的过去吗？你认为人间的法院里有这样的法官会原谅你过去的违法行为吗？你的过去证明你有罪，你的现在判你有罪，不管你请求多少次，答应多少次你以后会更加努力，会做得更好。“完全/完美”是神不变的要求和命令！

Others will propose that we will strive to Balance and even outweigh our bad with good. Four good deeds, they might say, make up for four bad deeds, in effect, I guess, canceling each other out. And so, they say, if you end up life with more pluses than minuses you should be okay with God.
But the truth is that not many sins but even one sin makes you a sinner and not all the good you do can make up for or pay for or wipe out even one sin. There is a price tag attached to every sin we commit and that is that each sin is deserving, according to God’s judgment, of death, eternal death and damnation. Just as one bad egg makes for a bad omelet no matter how many good ones you add to it, so one sin makes me a sinner, deserving of eternal separation from God.
另一些人提议我们努力用自己的好行为去平衡甚至超过我们的过失。他们会说，四件好事，弥补四件坏事。也就是说，把坏事抵消掉。所以，他们认为，只要你的生命中加号多，减号少，你在神面前就应该没问题。但事实是，不是很多罪，而是一个罪就足以让你成为一个罪人，即使所有的好事加起来也不能弥补一个罪，为它抵债，或者消除它。根据神的审判，我们所犯的每一个罪上都有一个价格标签：每一个罪都值得我们承受死亡、永远的死亡和沉沦。就像一个坏鸡蛋会使整个蛋卷都坏掉，不管你加入多少个好鸡蛋在里边，它还是坏的。所以，一个罪会让人成为罪人，就会和神永远隔离。

 A third way in which people try to solve their dilemma of a broken relationship with God is the COMPARISON method. We start comparing ourselves with other people and, of course, we can always find someone who is ‘worse” than we are and somehow we imagine that they will make us okay to God. But a little bit of searching will also find some/many in this world who are better than we are. And so now who should God save and who not? Where should He draw the line of acceptance, at the sixty or seventy percentile? How arbitrary and un-God-like such a judgment would be.
       The bottom line is that all human efforts fall short of the perfection that God commands and demands of us in the Law. Therefore the Apostle Paul, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, states the purpose of God’s law in Romans 3:20 when he writes: “Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.”(emphasize mine)
       人们试图解决和神之间破裂关系的第三个办法是比较。我们开始拿别人来和自己比较。我们总是能找到一个比自己“差”的人，以为这样就可以在神面前没问题。但是，只要稍稍留意，我们也会找到一些/很多比我们好的人。这样一来，神应该救谁，不救谁呢？神应该从哪儿划界线呢，百分之六十还是七十？这样的划分多专横，多不像神做的事情呀！
最后的底线是：人类一切的努力都无法满足神在律法中要求的完全。所以，在圣灵的启示下，使徒保罗在罗马书3：20中说明了神的律法的目的：“凡有血气的，没有一个因行律法能在神面前称义，因为律法本是叫人知罪（我的罪）。”

 We have a dilemma with regard to our relationship with God and we cannot resolve it by ourselves! Recognizing and admitting that truth is the first step to recovery. That is the conclusion to which God’s Holy Law would lead us and the purpose for which it was given, to see our sin and to recognize our need for a Savior.
       There is a SOLUTION for our dilemma, not man’s but God’s SOLUTION. It is a solution that has not been negotiated by man but implemented by God unilaterally. And it has been proclaimed to us in the all too familiar words of John 3:16, words we know by heart but which we need to grasp and hold on to with our hearts of faith given us by the Holy Spirit.
       我们在和神的关系上有个困境，而且我们无法自己解决。认识和承认这个事实是治愈的第一步。神的神圣律法最终要带领我们达到的认识，以及神给人律法的目的就是，让我们看见自己的罪，认识到我们需要一个救主。
我们的困境有一个解决办法，不是人的办法，而是神的解决办法。这个办法不是人商讨来的，而是由神单方面实施的。这个办法已经在我们很熟悉的经文-约3：16中宣告出来。我们已经牢记，但更需要凭借圣灵用信心来持守。

 To man’s horrible and hell earned dilemma the Apostle John, as the Lord’s spokesman says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Notice what happened when we were in our hopeless and helpless condition. God acted! His love moved him to act in our behalf. He loved the world, which had turned its back on Him and He acted favorably when we only deserved His disfavor.  He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, with Jesus full approval, to be the sacrifice and payment for our sins!
       对于人所面对的可怕地狱刑罚之难题，使徒约翰作为神的代言人，在约3：16 “神爱世人，甚至将他的独生爱子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不致灭亡，反得永生。”请注意我们在自己无望和无助的境况中发生的事情！神行动了！他对我们的爱驱使他为我们采取行动。尽管世界背离他，他仍然爱他们；我们只配他远离我们，但他却恩待我们。他让唯一的爱子耶稣，成为我们罪的赎价和祭物。

 In 2Corinthians 5:21 God’s word tells us how Jesus saves us. “God made Him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.” Jesus, the Son of God became a man. He was born, unlike ourselves, without sin. He lived a perfect life under the Law as our substitute, and then on the cross He took our sin on Himself and pays for them. He then gives us His righteousness, His holiness. This is the great exchange that has taken place. He takes our sins---He gives us His perfect-ness and so now we are right and holy in the sight of God because of Jesus!
       林后5：21神的话告诉我们耶稣是怎样救我们的。“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”耶稣，神的儿子成为人。他不像我们，虽然由人而生，却是无罪。他代替我们，在律法之下过着完美的生活，又在十字架上把我们的罪都放在自己身上，并为之付出赎价。然后，他把自己的公义和圣洁给了我们。这是个伟大的交换：他拿走了我们的罪---把他的完美给了我们，所以我们现在在神的眼里因为耶稣而成为公义和圣洁。

 And all of this was simply by God’s grace and through His working. Romans 5:8 says: “God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Jesus died the death we deserved and gives us the life we did not earn! Thus our salvation is 100% the working of God’s grace.
       And His action favored not only a few, or some, but ALL PEOPLE! Christ’s work in our behalf is universal. He paid for not only some sins, or many sins but ALL SINS, whether the people who hear that news believe it or not! That’s not just great news for us but it is a great message that we have to share with all! “Your sins have already been forgiven in Christ!---Believe it!--- That is God’s gift and promise to you!’
       所有的这一切都只是神的恩典和他自己的作为。罗5：8 说：“唯有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。”耶稣的死是我们当得的，他却把我们没有赚来的生命给了我们！因此，我们的救恩100%是神恩典的作为。
而且他的作为不是只让几个人，一些人受惠，而是给所有的人！基督为我们做的工作是宇宙性的。他不是只为一些罪，或者很多罪偿付了代价，而是所有的罪，不管听到的人相信不相信,那都是事实！那不光对我们来说是个天大的好消息，我们还必须与所有的人分享！“你的罪已经在基督里被饶恕！---要相信它！---那是神给你的礼物和承诺！

 Indeed “ The wages of sin is death---“ that’s what we deserved---“But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 6:23 It’s a gift and it’s yours in Jesus!
 I spend some time on the picture of the cross, flanked by the words: God’s justice and God’s love. In fact, those are the two attributes of God that come into play in our damnation/salvation account.
 On the one hand, God is love. He created us for Himself and He wants us to be with Him forever. But our sin will not allow for Him to gather us up into His arms of love.
       That is where the cross of Jesus comes into the picture, already planned in eternity, foretold in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New. It is on the cross that the justice of God is satisfied and the love of God is extended to mankind.
“罪的代价就是死---”这是事实，那是我们该受的---“但神在我们的主耶稣基督里给我们的礼物却是永生。”罗6：23 它是一个礼物，而且是你的，在耶稣里的！
       我曾留意画有十字架的图画，旁边写着：“神的公义和神的爱”。事实上，那是神的两个决定我们被定罪和得赎的特征。
       一方面，神是爱。他为自己造了我们，而且他想让我们永远和他同在。但我们的罪不能让他把我们聚在他爱的翅膀之下。
    那就是耶稣的十字架的由来---在永恒里早已计划,在旧约中预言，在新约里成就。只有在十字架上，神公义的要求才得以满足，神的爱才得以向人类表达。

 On the cross Jesus willingly accepted the sins of the world to be literally dumped on Him. Isaiah 53:6 declares: “the Lord God has laid on Him (Jesus) the iniquity (sins) of us all (the world).” That is why in spiritual agony Jesus cried out from the cross as He suffered the hell and the death that we deserved, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me!” Matthew 27:46. Can you even begin to imagine, God (Jesus) being forsaken by God(Father) for our sins! That’s what happened on the Cross. And then Jesus said, “It is finished.” John 19:30 That Greek word (telestai) literally means “paid in full.” The sins of the world have now by Jesus been paid IN FULL. How do we know that for sure? On the third day He rose again proving that He has now conquered sin and death and hell and the devil for us forever. (Romans4:25).
       在十字架上,耶稣情愿接受堆在他身上的来自世人的罪。以赛亚53：6宣告：“耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他（耶稣）身上。”这就是耶稣在十字架上
从灵里发出的痛苦呼喊的原因，因为他正在承受我们应该受的地域和死亡之苦：“我的神我的神，为什么离弃我！”太27：46。你能否开始设想一下：神（耶稣）为了我们的罪被父神遗弃！那就是在十字架上发生的事情。接着，耶稣说：“完成了！”约翰福音19：30 那个希腊字的意思就是：全都付了！我们怎么能肯定呢？第三天，他从死里复活，表明他已经为我们战胜了罪，死亡，地狱和那恶者。（罗马书4：25）
 The results and the effects of the Cross of Jesus and His death for the world can simply be summed up in the word Grace. This word, grace, put into the form of an acrostic can be defined in this way: G: God’s; R: Riches; A: At; C: Christ’s; E: Expense;
       That is what GRACE is. God simply giving us the riches of His love (forgiveness of sins, life and salvation) at Christ’s expense---He paid the full price of our redemption for us! 2Corinthians 8:9 says: “ For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.”
       耶稣为世人而死的十字架和它的结果可以简单地用一个字来概括： GRACE（恩典）。这个字拆分以后可以这样解释；G：God’s神的；R：Riches-丰富；A：At-以；C：Christ’s基督的；E：Expense：代价；
       这就是恩典。神把他的爱里所包含的丰富（对罪的饶恕，生命和救恩）以基督为代价给了我们---他为我们付清了救赎的代价！林后8：9说：“你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典：他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。”

 Romans8:1 declares now the bottom line for us who trust in Jesus as our Savior when Paul writes: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who have been saved, through faith---and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God---not by works, so that no one can boast.”
       All that remains now to be told is: our response to grace. How shall we respond to God’s grace saving us for Jesus’ sake? I returned to the story at the beginning of this Law and Gospel presentation.
罗马书8：1宣告了相信耶稣为救主的人的最后底线。保罗写道：“如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不被定罪了。”我们得救是神的恩典，也借助我们的信心---这不是出于你们自己，是神的礼物---不是凭自己的行为，免得有人自夸。
 现在还要说的是：我们对恩典的回应。我们对神借助耶稣拯救我们的恩典怎样回应？我再回到对神的恩典和律法的解释的开始部分。

   You are in a boat in the middle of the ocean, a thousand miles from the shore. You have no food or water. You are as good as dead. In fact, you are now unconscious (as good as dead) on the bottom of the boat. I come flying over in a helicopter. I see you in your dilemma. I lower a rope latter. I climb down and tie you to it. We lift you up into the helicopter and fly you back to land and put you into the hospital. The doctors and nurses nurse you back to life. One day the nurse says to you, “ The man who rescued you is going to come to see you tomorrow.” How do you feel? You are overjoyed to hear that good news. You can’t wait until he arrives and when he does you thank and praise and hug him. You tell him how much you love him and appreciate his saving work in your behalf. You think of him and thank him everyday of the rest of your life.
 你在大海中的一叶小舟上，离海岸还有一千英里。你没了食物，也没有水，你就剩下一口气了。事实上，你此时已经失去知觉（将近死亡），躺在船底。我乘直升机飞过来，看见你的险情，放下悬梯，爬下来把你用绳子捆上。我们把你提进飞机，运回陆地，送进医院。医生和护士照料你把你救活。有一天，护士对你说：“那个救你的人明天要来看你。”你会有什么感受？你听到这个消息会非常高兴,迫不及待地要见到他，感谢他，赞扬他，拥抱他。你告诉他你有多爱他，感激他对你的拯救。在你的余生，你会每天想到他，感激他。

That, my friends, in picture form, is the essence of the Christian life as it is now to be lived as the saved children of God. Our Christian life is simply wanting to say “thank you” to God for having saved us. 1John4:10-11 says it well: “This is love, not that we love God, but that He loved us and sent His son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we ought to love one another.”
亲爱的朋友，那就是用图画的形式把基督徒生活的内在本质表现出来，过一个被救赎的神的儿女的生活。我们的基督徒生活只是想向神说“谢谢你拯救我！” 约翰一书4：10-11说：“不是我们爱神，乃是神爱我们，差他的儿子，为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。亲爱的弟兄啊，神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。”

We can remember “our response” by simply keeping in mind the letter P.S. God’s Word, the Bible is His love letter to us. There He tells us what Jesus has done to save us and to give us eternal life. Our response is simply a P.S. added to His love letter, the P. standing for “praising God” and the S. standing for “serving others.” This P.S. is the sum total of the Christian new life in Christ, his life of sanctification. His life is no longer “have to” (Law directed) but “want to “ (Gospel motivated). It is then, at the close of this presentation that I ask the two questions of application based on what we have just learned from God’s Word.
       我们可以用两个简单的字母P.S来记住我们对神的回应。神的话，圣经是他给我们的情书。在里面他告诉我们耶稣为救我们而作的事情，他已经给了我们永生。我们的回应只是附在他的情书后的附言。P代表Praising God 赞美神。S代表 Serving others服务人。这个P.S. 就是基督徒在基督里新生命的总和---成圣的生活。他的生活不再是“不得不”（由律法为主导）而是“想要”（被福音激励）。在结尾的地方，我要问两个应用的问题。

Question One: If you were to die tonight, do you know for sure that you have eternal life? Let the person/people you are talking to respond. Don’t be surprised if they may still give a negative or an unsure response. The Good News of Jesus grace is hard to accept (understand) into our sins infected hearts. Go back and review a few key passages. Have them look at the last passage, John3: 36 which says: “ Whoever believes in the Son (Jesus) has eternal life.” You may want to then ask them, “do you believe in Jesus, that He died for your sins?” if they respond, “yes”, then have them look at this passage again and see what it says---“Whoever believes in the Son Has eternal life.” Notice that God’s ETERNAL LIFE. It is already an accomplished fact and it happened when Jesus died on the cross for the sins of the world and now it is His gift to you!
第一个问题：如果你今晚就死，你能肯定你有永生吗？让你的听众做出回答。如果他们仍然给出否定或不肯定的答案，不要惊讶。耶稣恩典的福音很难被我们已经被罪感染的心所明白和接受。回头再复习一些重要的部分，让他们再看一下约翰福音3：36。里面说：“信子（耶稣）的人有永生。”你还可以再问他们：“你相信耶稣为你的罪而死吗？”如果他们回答“是！”，就让他们再看这段经文：“信子（神儿子）的人有永生。”注意，那是神所赐的永生。它已经是一个完成了的事实，它是当耶稣在十字架上为世人的罪而死的时候发生的事情，而现在是他赐给你的礼物！

Question Two: I f God were to ask you, why should I let you into My Heaven, what would you say to Him? Answer: Because Jesus, your Son, paid for all of my sins! Oh, thousand, thousand thanks shall be---Dearest Jesus unto Thee. Amen.
 When I shared this message with people, whenever I would see them (a day or two later or a week or two later) I would simply ask question one again and allow them to answer. Yes, I am sure because Jesus died for me sins. Then I would invite them to come and study God’s Word in greater depth with me. Many in Grenada accepted this invitation to the praise and glory of God.
       第二个问题：如果神问你；我为什么要允许你进入天堂呢？你会怎么回答？答案是；因为耶稣，你的儿子为我所有的罪付了帐！哦，我要献给你我千万个感谢---亲爱的耶稣，阿门！
       当我和人分享过这个信息后，在一两天或一两周后再见到他们时，我会再问他们第一个问题让他们回答。是的，我肯定，因为耶稣为我的罪死了。然后我会邀请他们来和我更深层地学习神的话。很多在格林纳达的人接受了这个邀请，并一起来赞美荣耀神。
