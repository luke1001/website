12 ACTIONS OF CHRISTIAN LEADERS 基督徒带领者的12个行动
12 ACTIONS OF CHRISTIAN LEADERS
基督徒带领者的12个行动

1. LEADERS ARE STUDENTS OF THE WORD (Bible Study and Worship):
‘The church is better off being led by two or three spiritual men than by seven or eight who are not in the Word!”    See Acts 6:1-6 (v.3); 2 Peter 3:18; 2 Timothy 3:16
带领者是神话语的学生（查经和敬拜）
 “教会由两三个属灵的人带领要比由七八个不在神话语里的人带领更好”请看使徒行传6章1-6节(3节)；彼得后书3章:18节；提摩太后书3章:16节
2. LEADERS KNOW AND SEEK TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH:
“To know the mission of the church we simply need to keep on asking: ‘Lord, what is it that you want us to be doing here until you come again in glory?’ He clearly tells us in His Word.”    Matthew 28:18-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:45-48; John 20:21; Acts 1:8
带领者知道并寻求完成教会的大使命
“要明白教会的使命，我们只需不断求问:‘主，你愿意我们在这里做什么，直到袮在荣耀中再来’祂在圣经中清楚的告诉了我们”马太福音28章:18-20节；马可福音16章:15节；路加福音24章:45-48节；约翰福音20:21节；使徒行传1章:8节

3. LEADERS EXERCISE A CHRIST-LIKE SERVANT SPIRIT AND JOY IN THEIR WORK:
“A Christ-like servant spirit sets the tone (attitude) and pace (action) for the congregation…attitude + action is infectious.”
Mark 10;45; Philippine 2:1-8
带领者操练像基督一样服事的精神并以他们的工作为乐。
“一个像基督的仆人的精神为会众定音(态度)和设定节奏(行动)…态度+行动就是感染力”马可福音10章:45节；腓立比书2章:1-8节
4. LEADERS ARE ENCOURAGERS:
“Leadership has less to do with position than it does with your disposition. Be an encourager and you will help people more than you can imagine.”  Hebrews 10:23-24; Galatians 3:26-29
带领者是鼓励者
“带领重于性情更甚于职位。成为一个鼓励者，你将能超乎想象的帮助人”希伯来书10章:23-24节；加拉太书3章:26-29节

5. LEADERS ARE PEOPLE OF PRAYER:
Prayer is simply God’s invitation to have a heart to heart talk with Him. “Prayer moves the hand that moves the universe.”; Philippians 4:6; I Thessalonians 5:17
带领者是祷告者
祈祷，简单来说就是神邀请你和祂交心谈话。“祷告感动那推动宇宙的手”腓立比数4:6节；帖撒罗尼迦前书5章:17节

6. LEADERS ARE OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE OF GOD’S REDEEMING LOVE IN CHRIST:
“The anchor of our Christian optimism is the forgiveness of sins earned for the world and thus for us by the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, our Savior and Lord, and His gift of eternal life with Him in Heaven. Our purpose in life now is simply to share this message of hope and peace and life with the world.”     Luke 10:20; Philippians 4:13
带领者是乐观的，因有神在基督里救赎之爱。
我们基督徒乐观精神的锚在于：这世界及至于我们的罪得以赦免，乃因我们救主耶稣的生命、受死和复活，以及和祂同在天堂的永恒生命的礼物。我们现世的生命目的就是向世界分享这个充满盼望、和平和生命的信息。路加福音10章:20节；腓立比书4章:13节
7. LEADERS WORK AT TRUST AND CONSENSUS BUILDING:
“Unity in the Word and harmony in the work creates a good church atmosphere, produces energy to get the job done, gives powerful testimony to the world (image), gives all glory to God and robs Satan of causing dissention in the church.”  Ephesians 4:1-16; Romans 12:9-21
带领者致力于信赖和建立共识
“在神话语上的合一与工作上的和睦会创造出良好的教会气氛，生发出完成任务的力量，向世界做出有力的见证（名声），将所有荣耀归于神并剥夺撒旦在教会布散纷争”以弗所书4章:1-16节；罗马书12章:9-21节
8. LEADERS PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN PLANNING THE WORK AND IN WORKING THE
     PLAN:
“People do what people see. Let people see you planning and doing the work of the Lord and then invite them to join you in the process.” Proverbs 15:22; James 4:13-17
带领者以计划事工和执行计划来带领
“人们参与到他们可见的工作中。让人们看到你设定计划，为主工作然后邀请他们参与到这个进程中来”箴言书15章:22节；雅各书4章:13-17节

9.   LEADERS PRACTICE “REDUNDANT” COMMUNICATION:
“ Communication bridges gaps, removes barriers and enlists people to share in the vision.”   See Ephesians 4:29
带领者操练“多余的”沟通
“沟通连接分歧，去除障碍并争取人们分担异象”请看以弗所书4章:29节
10. THE LEADERSHIP TEAM HAS A BIAS FOR ACTION, THAT IS, A DESIRE
TO KEEP ONGETTING THE JOB DONE RATHER THAN JUST TALKING ABOUT IT:
“Plans that are not implemented are only dreams that lead to frustration rather than fulfillment. Turning good plans into actions is a primary function of leadership. ”   I Corinthians 15:58; ! Corinthians 10;31
带领团队偏爱行动，意即，长存完成工作的盼望而不是仅仅纸上谈兵
“不实施的计划就是梦想，只能引发挫折而不是满足感。把好的计划转为行动是带领的主要职责

11. THE LEADERS FOSTER A “CLIMATE OF PERMISSION,”   ENCOURAGING NEW
        IDEAS IN KEEPING WITH THE THEOLOGY AND PURPOSE OF THE CHURCH:
 “We must always clearly define: 1) What cannot change; 2) What may change; and 3) What must change. Be bold in holding on to what cannot change; be flexible where change may be possible, permissible and even beneficial and be courageous and unswerving in changing the things that stand in the way of the free course of the Gospel to all peoples of the world.” I Corinthians 2:1-5;   Corinthians 9:19-22
带领者们培育“许可的气氛”鼓励符合神学和教会目的的新想法
“我们必须常常清楚的定义：1)什么是不能改变的；2)什么可能改变；以及3)什么必须改变。要勇敢的持守那不能改变的；对可能改变之处灵活处理，给予许可甚至助益，并且勇敢、坚定的改变那些妨碍向世界广传福音的事。”哥林多前书2章:1-5节；哥林多前书9章:19-22节
12. THERE IS A GOOD MIX OF “VETERAN” AND “NEWER” MEMBERS ON THE LEADERSHIP TEAM WITH COMMON GOALS AND A DIVERSITY OF GIFTS.
The word team used as an acronym says: T ogether    E veryone      A ccomplishes      M ore.”  2 Timothy 2:2; I Corinthians 12:12-27
在带领的团队中有“熟手”和“新兵”及共同的目标和多种恩赐将是很好的搭配。
“团队(TEAM)这个词的每个字母可分别代表一个词：Together共同 Everyone每个人 Accomplishes完成 More更多”提摩太后书2章:2节哥林多前书12章12-27节

“Only one life to live, ‘Twill soon be passed. Only what’s done in Christ will last.    Matthew 6:20; I Corinthians 10:31
“只有一命可活，且将很快逝去。唯有在基督里所做的才能长存”马太福音6章:20节；哥林多前书10章:31节
