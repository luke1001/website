LEADER'S NOTES FOR “FAITH WALK - FAITH TALK”“信心之行---信心之言”教导者笔记
LEADER'S NOTES FOR “FAITH WALK - FAITH TALK”
“信心之行---信心之言”教导者笔记
These LEADER'S NOTES are offered to assist you in presenting FAITH WALK – FAITH TALK
as an introductory course to your people and/or to new Christians joining your church in a one or two hour setting. This study may be presented at the close of your BIBLE INFORMATION COURSE with new members.
这个教导者笔记是为了协助你教导“信心之行---信心之言”这个课程，这是一个入门（介绍性）课程，针对教会的成员或是刚加入教会的新基督徒，课时为一到两个小时。这个课程可以在新成员学习完“圣经基础知识课程”之后予以教授。
Since more people meet Jesus and/or enter into the life of the church by invitation of a Friend, Relative, Associate or Neighbor, it will be our goal to teach "friendship (FRANship) witnessing" to all of our people on an on-going basis.
越来越多的人通过朋友，亲人，同事和邻舍的见证（邀请）而认识耶稣或是进入教会生活，因此，对于我们所有的信徒，持续不断的教导如何在朋友间作见证，这就是我们的目标。
The following comments will follow the outline: 下面的注解是跟着大纲写的：
INTRODUCTION: As we prepare to witness to others it is important for us to remember WHO WE ARE by the grace of God and throught the work of our Savior, Jesus Christ. It is also important for us to remember that what Jesus has done for us, paid for our sins, He has also accomplished for the world (I John 2:2, John 3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:19, etc.) We don’t have to say to a friend, “Your sins will be forgiven IF you believe in Jesus,” but the truth is and we can say: “Your sins have already been forgiven by Jesus…believe it!” Therefore we can live daily with the peace and joy of forgiveness in Jesus and (Luke 10:20) “rejoice that your names are written in Heaven.” The “joy of salvation” shows itself in our actions and words lived in relationships.
序言：在我们准备要对他人做见证时，铭记自己（在基督里）的位份对我们非常重要，这位份乃是因着神的恩典靠着我们的救主耶稣基督的作为而得的。同时，清楚地知道主耶稣为我们的罪所付上的代价和为我们以及世人所成就的，这对我们也很重要（约翰一书2：2； 约翰福音3：16；哥林多后书5：19；等等） 。我们并不是要对朋友说“如果你信耶稣的话，你的罪就得赦免”，而事实是“靠着耶稣，你的罪已经得到了赦免。。。。信吧！”我们可以这样说。因此我们每天都可以满有平安喜乐地活在主耶稣的赦免之恩里，我们也因我们的名被记录在天上而欢喜（路加福音10：20）。在生活中与人的相处中我们的言行处处透露着“救恩的喜乐”。
I. FRIENDSHIP WITNESSING DEFINED: 定义“朋友间的见证”：
A. F.W. is NOT just an exercise on "How to Win Friends and Influence People." There is an eternal goal and purpose in mind, that of sharing Jesus who is the Savior of the world (see John 3;16 and II Corinthians 5:19). Our desire to tell others about Jesus flows out of love, gratitude and concern. The love of Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:14); gratitude for what He has done for us and the world; and concern for souls that motivates us to witness to Jesus..
“朋友间的见证”并不是演练“如何来赢得朋友影响他人”，而是为了向朋友分享耶稣是世人的救主这个好消息，要将这样一个永恒的目标紧存于心（见 约翰福音3：16；哥林多后书5：19）。出于爱，感恩和关切，我们渴望向人们传讲主耶稣。对主耶稣的爱（哥林多后书5：14），因耶稣为我们和世人所成就的而感恩，以及对（迷失）灵魂的关切，这些就是我们要为主耶稣做见证的动力。
B. F.W. is Biblical. Listed are just a few examples from Scripture of friendship witnessing in action.
“朋友间的见证”是有圣经依据的。下面只是圣经中“朋友间见证”的实例。
Have different people look up these passages and pick out the specific words which picture friendship witnessing in action.
请大家来查考这些经文，并挑出描述朋友间见证的个别词句。
1) John 1:40-51: Andrew brought his brother Peter to meet Jesus. Philip invited Nathaniel to "come and see.”
约翰福音1：40-51：安得烈把他的弟兄彼得带来见耶稣。腓力请拿但业“来看”（耶稣）。
2) Mark 2:13-17: (Levi) When Levi (Matthew) was called to follow Jesus, he had a "party" and invited his friends to meet Jesus..."many tax collectors and 'sinners' were eating with him (Jesus)...."
马可福音2：13-17：（利未）当利未（马太）蒙召跟随耶稣时，他开了一个“宴席”并邀请他的朋友来见耶稣….“有 好 些 税 吏 和 罪 人 ， 与 耶 稣 并 门 徒 一 同 坐 席”
3) John 4:39-42: (Samaritan woman) "Many believed in Him (Jesus) become of the woman's testimony." She told others she knew what she had found out about this Christ.
约翰福音4：39-42：（撒马利亚妇人）“那 城 里 有 好 些 撒 玛 利 亚 人 信 了 耶 稣 ， 因 为 那 妇 人 作 见 证。”她将她对这位基督的认识告诉了人们。
4) Mark 5:19: (Gadarean demoniac) Jesus told him to "Go home to your family and tell them...."
马可福音5：19：（被鬼附的格拉森人）耶稣要他“你 回 家 去 ， 到 你 的 亲 属 那 里 ， 将 主 为 你 所 作 的….. 都 告 诉 他 们”。
5) Acts 10:24-44: (Cornelius) "he called together his relatives and close friends" to hear what Peter had to say about Jesus
使徒行传10：24-44：（哥尼流）“哥 尼 流 已 经 请 了 他 的 亲 属 密 友”来听彼得对耶稣的见证。
C. F.W. is "letting your light shine" (Mt. 5:16); it is "being doers of the Word and not hearers only"
(James 2:22); it is living the "fruit of the Spirit" in relationships (Gal. 5:22). It is living a life of praise and gratitude to God and showing love, care, concern and service toward others because of what Jesus has done for you! DEEDS, at times, need to precede WORDS to show that we care and love. Deeds are like the music which accompanies the words of a song. They accompany and set the tone for the words. Music sets the tone and words convey the message. Someone has said, "People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care!" HOWEVER, deeds need to be followed by WORDS so that people will see Jesus not only as "the reason for the season" but as the Savior of all people! Friendship witnessing is a life style, living our faith in Jesus in deed and in word in the world.
“朋友间的见证”是“你 们 的 光 也 当 这 样 照 在 人 前”（马太福音5：16）；是“不仅只听这道而要将这道行出来”（雅各书2：22）；是要在我们的日常人际关系中结出“圣灵的果子”（加拉太书5：22）；是要在我们的生命中对神献上赞美感恩，因着主耶稣为我们所成就的而去爱，关怀，关切并服事我们身边的人！行有时要走在言前面，以此来表达我们的爱与关怀。行就像是一首歌的曲，它总是伴着词。它伴着词并为词定下了调。曲定调，词传义。有人说“没有人关心你知道多少，直到他们知道你有多关心！”然而，言要紧随着行，这样人们才能看到主耶稣不只是“圣诞节的真义”而且也是所有人的救主！“朋友间见证”是一种生活方式，在这世上将我们在耶稣里的信心用我们的行动和言语活出来。
D. F.W. is like building bridges. Our relationship with another person is like a bridge over which communication and actions flow. Some bridges may be fragile, like some rotten boards hanging over a river that has alligators down below. Few (if any) would attempt to cross such a bridge. The goal in friendship witnessing is to build stronger bridges to people so that over them we (or someone with us) might share Jesus as Savior. No one builds a bridge simply to look at and admire it. Bridges serve a purpose. The purpose of working at "stronger bridges of relationships to and with people," even those who today may be strangers to us, is to share Christ and offer the gift of eternal life! Bridge building and barrier removing are pre-evangelism. They have no power to save. Only the Gospel saves. They simply "prepare the way" for communicating the Gospel.
“朋友间的见证”就像搭建桥梁。我们与人的关系就像搭建在交流和行动上的一座桥。有的桥可能岌岌可危，像是悬在河上的几片朽木，河里还有鳄鱼出没。没有什么人愿意尝试过这样的桥。“朋友间见证”的目标就是要与人建立坚实的桥梁，通过这样的桥梁我们才能（或是我们陪同别人来）分享耶稣是我们的救主。没有人建桥只是为了观赏。桥梁是有它的用途。与人，甚至是与今天的陌生人建立坚固桥梁是为了要分享基督，让更多的人得到永生。建立桥梁和去除障碍是为传福音作准备。他们本身并没有救赎之能。唯有福音能使人得救。他们只是为传福音“预备道路”。
NOTE: Friendship witnessing happens today! Surveys conducted over the years and involving thousands of people indicate that more people (70+ percent) through a contact with and invitation from a friend, relative, associate and/or neighbor. REMEMBER that these statistics are not static or fixed for every congregation. For example increased pastoral visits or more intentionalized evangelism efforts could result in the percentage being much higher than indicated here. A well organized, quality Sunday School vigorously publicized in the community might well result in a much high percentage of people entering the church or meeting Jesus in this way. Small group Bible studies are a wonderful way to introduce new people to Jesus. Also all of us can recount stories of how children brought their parents to meet Jesus.
注释：“朋友间见证”就发生在当今！涉及上千人的多年调查显示多数人（70%以上）都是通过朋友，亲人，同事或邻舍的见证才开始认识耶稣的。切记这些统计数据不是在每个教会都固定不变的。举例来说，频繁的牧师家访或更多的特别以传福音为目的的工作投入会使这个百分比增加。一个在社区中作了充分宣传并且计划周全高质量的儿童主日学也会使更多的人来到教会或以这样的方式认识耶稣。小型查经班是向新来的人介绍耶稣的好途径。同时，我们所有人都可以数算一下有多少人是因为孩子的缘故才来教会而认识耶稣的。
Even if these percentages are somewhat different in your church, the highest percentage by far is still likely to be F.R.A.N. INVITATION.
虽然在你所在的教会这些百分比可能有些不同，但迄今为止通过“朋友，亲人，同事或邻舍的见证”而开始认识耶稣的人仍然可能是占最大的比例。
II. FRIENDSHIP WITNESSING PRACTICED:  实践“朋友间的见证”
What follows are five steps a Christian may follow in practicing friendship witnessing? Such a focused and planned effort is often necessary because the devil, the world and our own sinful flesh will try to rob us of the priorities of our lives, that is, a) living to the glory of God in gratitude for our Savior and b) sharing the gift of eternal life through Jesus with others.
以下是一个基督徒在实践“朋友间见证”时可以遵循的五步。这样一个有计划有重心的投入常常是必要的，因为魔鬼，这世界以及我们自身的罪都会竭力让我们丢弃生命中的最重要的事：a)心存对救主的感恩，活着荣耀神；b)对人传讲靠主耶稣得永生。
A. IDENTIFY: My "mission family" is any person 1) who does not know or confess Jesus as His Savior and Lord and/or 2) who isn't presently active in a Christian church.
确认：我的“传福音对象”可以是任何一个1）不认识或还没有承认耶稣为他的神和救主的人2）现在在（基督教）教会里还没有积极参与服事的人
We will witness to every one about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and His completed work for the world, even to those who are active in other Christian churches. We do want them to be sure their eternal hope rests in Christ alone. We will confess Jesus and seek to bring to our fellowship for continuing nurture in the Word those who have no Christian church affiliation. This includes those who belong to churches that are not Christian, such as, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, etc.
我们要对每一个人，甚至对已经积极参与教会服事的人，见证耶稣基督的生，死和复活，以及他为世人所成就的。我们是要让他们对自己单单在基督里的永生盼望确信无疑。我们要见证主耶稣，将那些没有加入教会的人带到我们的团契中来，继续用神的话（圣经）来喂养他们。这也包括那些虽然去教会但却不是基督徒的人，像是耶和华见证会，摩门教，等等。
Each person, on the average, comes into contact with 50 to 60 people in his weekday life. How many, according to the above definition, belong to your personal mission field? Make a list. Keep it in a prominent place (like your study Bible). Keep adding names.
每个人平均每个星期要接触50到60人。根据以上的定义，这其中有多少是属于你个人的传福音的工场？列出一个名单。把它放在一个明显的地方（像是你自己的圣经）。并不断加入新的名字。
Three important steps in identifying your "mission family" are:  确认你的“福音对象”时重要的三步：
STOP - Take some time to think and pray about it.   停 – 花一些时间来思想并为之祷告。
LOOK - Keep your eyes open. Look around you.   看 – 睁大双眼，察看你的四周。
LISTEN - Keep your ears open. Ask a few questions and listen.   听 – 竖起双耳，提出问题并听取回应。
B. PRAY: Keep a list of the names of your "mission family" in your Bible and daily devotional material.
Then begin to pray for them REGULARLY...daily! SPECIFICALLY...as you get to know them better and find out about some of their personal needs, etc. Finally, start praying "DANGEROUSLY"....that is, saying, "Lord, I don't know if I am ready or not, but use me if you will to reach out with Jesus to these people. Help me bring them to meet Jesus!"
祷告：在你的圣经和每日的灵修材料中放一个你“传福音对象”的名单。然后，开始每天为这些人祷告，特别是在你对他们的认识加深并了解到他们各自的需要时。最后，要开始“迫切地”祷告….就是，说“上帝，虽然我不知道自己是不是已经预备好了，但如果您要让这些人认识耶稣，那就请您使用我。帮助我带领他们来认识耶稣！”
C. FOCUS AND PLAN: 专注与计划
FOCUS your efforts on one or two people at first. Continue to pray for all of your mission family, but concentrate on building stronger bridges one at a time. This will keep it from becoming a seemingly overwhelming task. Trust the Lord to guide you in your process of seeking to be His witness.
先将你的精力专注在一两个人身上。不断为你的福音对象代祷，但一次只专注于同一个人建立桥梁。这样以来，这就不会成为一件看似艰难的工作了。在你寻求成为上帝的见证人时完全信靠神的带领。
PLAN....Look for the opportunity to do some things together. Look for opportunities to introduce your FRAN to other Christians and invite to come to Christian activities.
计划….寻找可以一起同工的机会。寻找机会把你的福音对象介绍给其他的基督徒认识，并邀请他们才参加教会的活动。
D. REMEMBER: The FIVE B's  切记：五个要
1) BE...a good listener. Listening is simply earning the right to be heard. By listening you will find "doors and windows" into people's lives and find places for making personal application of God's Word.
要做一个善听的人。去聆听才会被聆听。通过聆听你才能找到进入人们生活的“门窗”，也才能找到将神的话实践在个人身上的切入点（传福音的机会）。
2) BE...sensitive to times of change or need in people's lives (Examples: illness; birth of a baby; death; birthday; anniversary, etc). At such times people will be more open to you as a person and be willing to hear what you have to say. Problems in our lives are only symptoms of the greater problem, a broken relationship with God...sin, for which there is only one perfect solution, the cross of Christ and His perfect and unconditional love.
要小心留意变故或是人们生活中的需要（例如：疾病；婴孩出生；死亡；生日；周年纪念，等等）。在这样的时候，人们常常会更愿意与你交通愿意聆听你的意见想法。我们生活中的问题只是一个更大问题的表征，那就是与神关系的破裂….罪，而对于罪，只有一个解决办法，那就是基督的十字架和他完美无条件的爱。
3) BE...patient. Remember, our task is to plant the Word, to water and fertilize with love, care and concern. It is God's task to grant the increase. See I Corinthians 3:6-7
要有耐心。切记，我们的工作是撒种，用爱来浇灌和关怀。让其成长是神的工作。见 哥林多前书 3：6-7
4) BE...joyful. Have a resurrection faith, a hope in Christ even when the going gets tough. Such joy is powerful testimony to our mission family. Read and apply Luke 10:20.
要喜乐。即使前面的路变得艰难，我们也要有救赎的信心和在基督里的盼望。这样的喜乐是对我们的福音对象有力的见证。请研读路加福音10：20。
5) BE...yourself, that is, be normal and natural in your witnessing to Christ. "Not better...just forgiven in Christ" is the attitude and spirit we want to convey.
要真诚自然。在你见证基督时要自然（不做作）。我们的态度以及要传达的精神是“不是我们（比你们）好…..而我们只是在基督里得饶恕”。
E. INVITE your mission family to special services, events and activities planned by your congregation.
Unchurched people will tell you that the most difficult place to go the first time is to a worship service. Ask your congregation to hold a planning day with a focus on outreach and planning events, activities and Bible studies for which you can extend an invitation to your FRAN’s. Keep on inviting.
邀请你的福音对象来参加特别的礼拜，查经班，以及你们教会组织的活动。不去教会的人会告诉你他们最不愿意第一次去就参加主日崇拜。组织会众来举办一个以对外传福音为重点的策划日，筹备查经班和各样活动，你就可以邀请你的福音对象来参加。继续不断地邀请。
III. TALKING ABOUT JESUS WITH OUR FRAN’s (See I Peter 3:15) 对我们的朋友，亲人，同事和邻舍传讲主耶稣 （见 彼得前书3：15）
The I Peter passage is a beautiful Word of God regarding friendship witnessing. With Jesus in our hearts and preparing ourselves through study of God’s Word and prayer, we will be ready to tell others about the hope, peace, joy, love and forgiveness we have because of Jesus. And we will share Him and His love with others in a kind and respectful way.
彼得前书中的这节经文很好地讲述了朋友间的见证。将主耶稣放在我们的心中，通过学习神的话语和祷告来预备我们自己，我们就可以与人分享我们因着主耶稣而得的盼望，喜乐，爱和饶恕。我们也能以亲切友好谦恭的方式来分享耶稣和他的爱。
A. Put your “journey of faith” in Jesus in your own words. Tell others what Jesus has done and what He means to you RATHER than trying to convince them of what Jesus has done for them. They can apply “your story” to their life. Of course we will want to share with them the Good News that what Jesus has done for me, He has also done for the world….and that includes you!
用你自己的话将你在耶稣里的“信心历程”表达出来。与人分享耶稣对你的意义和他在你生命中的作为，而不是竭力要说服对方相信耶稣在他们身上的作为。他们可以由“你的故事”联想到自己的生活。当然，我们要与他们分享福音，分享耶稣为我们，为世人，包括为他们所成就的。
B. Remember and share the A, B, C’s of our Christian faith. ....This Gospel message, what Jesus has done for the world, is the Word that the Holy Spirit uses to create faith and/or to strengthen faith in our hearts. A simple outline for witnessing is to simply remember the A,B,C's of our Christian faith. They are:
谨记并分享我们基督信仰的A, B, C。福音的信息，主耶稣为世人所成就的，就是圣灵用来在我们心中建立和（或）坚固信心的道。见证的简要提纲就是单单记住我们基督信仰的A, B, C。 他们是：
A - Jesus lived for all under the Law of God (Ten Commandments) which we have broken by thought, word and deed. He kept it perfectly for us. See Galatians 4:4-5
耶稣为我们所有人而生在律法（十诫）之下，我们的所思，所言和所行都违背了这律法。他却为我们毫无指责地谨守了律法。见 加拉太书4：4-5。
B - Jesus died to pay for the sins of all people. When He said, "It is finished," He was declaring the debt of sin fully paid for forever by His sacrifice for us. See Isaiah 53:6 and John19:30. “It is finished” is the translation of the Greek word telesthai which literally means “paid in full.” It declares that all sins from begging of time until the end of time, have been paid for by the “shed blood of Jesus.”
耶稣受死为我们所有人的罪付上代价。当他说，“成了！”他是在宣告因着他（他的祭）罪的工价已被完全付清。见 以赛亚书53：6 和约翰福音19：30。 “成了”在希腊语中的原词是telesthai ，字面的意思就是“付清了”。它宣告从起初直到末了所有罪的代价都已被耶稣的宝血付清。
C - Jesus rose again from the dead on the third day to show and to prove that He has conquered sin and death and hell for us and for all forever! See Romans 4:25
耶稣在第三天从死里复活，以显明他已为我们为所有人永远地胜过罪，死亡和地狱！见 罗马书4：25。
C. SHARE WITH OTHERS…. Talk about real events from everyday life in order to share with others the help, the peace, joy and hope and above all else, the certainty of eternal life in Heaven with Jesus through Jesus.
与人分享….与他们谈论日常生活中发生的真实事情，这是为了与他们分享从耶稣来的帮助，平安，喜乐和盼望，更重要的是分享对（与主耶稣同在天家的）永生的坚信，这永生是靠着耶稣得来的。
D, SOME PASSAGES to remember when you share your faith in Jesus (There are many other passages that could be added to your list. What are your favorites?)
一些在分享你在耶稣里的信心时要记住的经文（还有许多其它的经文也可以加入到你自己的单子中。哪些是你最喜欢的经文呢？）
1) Matthew 5:48...."Be perfect..." God's demand of all!  马太福音5：48….“你 们 要 完 全….”上帝对所有人的要求
2) Romans 3:23...."All have sinned and fall short..." of God's demands  罗马书3：23…..“世 人 都 犯 了 罪，亏 缺 了….”神的要求
3) Romans 6:23..."The wages of sin is death" but "The gift of God is eternal life"  罗马书6：23….“罪 的 工 价 乃 是 死”但 “神 的 恩 赐 乃 是 永 生”
4) John 3:16 & 36 "Whoever believes in Jesus HAS eternal life"  约翰福音3：16&36 “信 子 的 人 有 永 生”
5) Ephesians 2:8-9 "We are saved by grace through faith" in Christ alone!  以弗所书2：8-9….“得 救 是 本 乎 恩 ， 也 因 着 信”单单在基督里的信
E. OUR DILEMMA – GOD’S SOLUTATION is one way in which you may share your faith through using LAW and GOSPEL. We will study this way in some detail.
我们的困境 --- 上帝的解决方法 这是通过律法和福音来分享你信仰的一种方法。我们会对这个方法作进一步的学习。
