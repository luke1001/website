Chuches many why
THE CHURCH AND CHURCHES
无形教会和有形教会
I. There is only one HOLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH, THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS (invisible) and there are many CHURCHES (visible). See diagram below:
只有一个圣而公之教会，圣徒间相通（无形的），但有许多有形的教会。见下面的图表：
Churches-Many-Why-01

II. One Bible but many different churches (denominations)….why?
一本圣经但多个不同的教派…..为什么？

A. One Bible (God’s Word) but three different approaches:
一本圣经（神的话）但三种不同的（研读）门径：

1. The Bible plus tradition: The Bible is the basis for doctrine but it is to be understood in light of the traditions of the church developed over time. This results in teachings that are nowhere to be found in God’s Word, but which were accepted over time by the church.
(Examples: Prayer to Mary; Purgatory; Indulgences)
圣经附加传统：圣经是教义的根据，但要依照长期演变积累下来的教会传统来理解圣经。这就导致产生了没有圣经（神的话）依据的教导，但这样的教导却一直都被教会认可接受。
（例如：对马利亚祷告；炼狱；赎罪券）

2. The Bible in the light of reason: The Bible is the basis for doctrine but it is to be understood and interpreted in the light of reason. For example, when there are difficult passages or truths that are taught that do not seem reasonable, they are given different, and often a variety of interpretations. (Examples: The Trinity; Infant Baptism; The Real Presence in Lord’s Supper; Election to Salvation or Damnation)
依靠理性的圣经：圣经是教义的根据，但要依照理性来解析圣经。例如，当难理解的经文或教授的真理看起来不合理时，他们就会被赋予不同的，而且常常是多种多样的解释。（例如：三位一体；婴儿洗礼；主耶稣在圣餐中真实的存在；被拣选得救恩或永刑）

3. The Bible Alone: The Bible is the only and final authority when it comes to both doctrine and practice. In cases of difficult passages, we let the Bible interpret itself, the simple and clear passages shedding light on the difficult. Even when Scripture seems to contradict itself according to our reason (paradox), we accept it as truth because it is God’s Word and “His wisdom is greater and higher than the wisdom of men.” See Isaiah 55:6-11 “The Bible, the whole Bible and nothing but the Bible”
唯独圣经：在制定教义和实践真理时，圣经是唯一的也是最终的权威凭据。对于难理解的经文，我们要让圣经自释，简单明了的经文揭示难的经文。甚至当在我们的理性看来圣经自相矛盾（悖论）时，我们也要接受他为真理，因为他是神的话语也因为“神的智慧大过高过人的智慧。”见 以赛亚书 55：6-11 “圣经，整本圣经，圣经以外别无它据”

B. Grace alone or Grace plus or minus….a confusing (mixing) of Law and Gospel
唯独恩典，或附加恩典或打折扣的恩典…..律法和福音的混淆
