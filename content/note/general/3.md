The Components of Mentoring
辅导的组成部分
There are three components to mentoring. It is intentional. It is individualized. It is Spirit-empowered.
辅导由三个部分组成：目的性、个人化、圣灵驱动。
We will take a closer look at each component. However, before we do that, now is the time for you to start thinking about a believer the Spirit has positioned you to mentor. You’ll find it helpful to think about a specific person when we talk about those components.
我们将细说每一个部分。然而，在此之前，请你想出一位圣灵带领你要去辅导的人。在我们继续谈论那些组成部分之前，有一个具体的人在脑海中，会对你的学习很有帮助。
1. Mentoring is Intentional 辅导是有目的性的。
a. Jesus based his mentoring on building a relationship between himself and his disciples. Is there any evidence that his approach to mentoring was planned, well-considered, intentional? Is there any evidence of Jesus’ mentoring was accidental, that it “just happened”? Comment on these examples.
耶稣的辅导，是以他与门徒之间的关系为基础的。可否证明，他的辅导方法是有计划，经过仔细考虑，而且带有目的性的？或是否有证据说明，耶稣的辅导只是偶然，突发的？查考以下几例并给予说明。
i. Simon Peter, the impetuous fisherman 西门比得，一个鲁莽冲动的渔夫。
(1) Luke 5:1-11 路加福音5：1-11
ii. Zacchaeus, the hated tax man撒该 ，被人憎恨的收税官
(1) Luke 19:1-16路19：1-16
iii. The woman who was society’s outcast 被社会遗弃的妇女
(1) John 4:7-15约4：7——15
2. Mentoring is Individualized 辅导针对个体进行
a. The Savior never views anyone as just another name in his heavenly computer file. Like Jeremiah, he has known us from eternity and created us to be unique beings.
在天国的电脑档案里，救主从未把一个人只是看作是另一个名字而已。就像他认识耶利米一样，神在永恒中就认识我们，把我们创造得独一无二。
i. “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations” (Jeremiah 1:5).
“我未将你造在腹中，我已晓得你；你未出母胎，我已分别你为圣；我已派你作列国的先知。”（耶1：5）
b. He recognizes us as unique individuals,
他看我们为独一的个体。
i. The LORD says..,, “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine” (Isaiah 43:1).
“耶和华说---”你不要害怕！因为我救赎了你。我曾提你的名召你，你是属我的。“（赛43：1）
c. He directs our lives, shaping our experiences to personally fit us.
他指导我们的生活，塑造我们个人的经历，使之适合我们的个体。
i. No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it (1 Corinthians 10:13).” 你们所遇见的试探，无非是人所能受的。神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的。在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。“（林前10：13）
d. The Gospel record of Jesus’ training his disciples shows how he dealt with each one according to their personality, their needs, their worldview. Think back to Jesus’ approach to inviting Peter, Zacchaeus, and the Samaritan woman to follow him. Notice: These were three different people. He approached them in three different ways.
福音书中对耶稣训练门徒的记载表明，他是怎样根据他们的性格，需要，他们的世界观来与每一个人相处的。回想耶稣邀请比得，撒该，和撒玛利亚妇女来跟随他时的方法。注意：这里有三个不同的人。他用了三种不同的方法接近他们。
e. What do you know about the person you might mentor? Fill in as much information as you can. You can complete the list later. Are there other areas it would be good for you to know about if you are to mentor this person as an individual? How will this information affect the way you mentor this person?
对于你要辅导的人，你了解多少？将你了解的信息填入以下的表格内。你可以以后完成。如果你要去辅导这个人，有没有别的方面需要你去了解，以便更好地进行个人辅导？这个信息将怎样影响你对他/她的辅导？
Person you might mentor: 你可能要辅导的人是：
Age: 年龄
Hobbies: 爱好
Children (age, gender): 孩子（年龄，性别）
Birth family: 出生家庭
Areas of personal strengths: 个人的长处

Mentoring is Spirit-Empowered辅导由圣灵推动
a. We hear Paul describe how essential the Spirit’s role is in mentoring when he writes to the Colossians.
我们从保罗写给歌罗西信徒的书信中，听到圣灵在辅导过程中的基要作用。
i. We proclaim [Christ], admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me (1:28-29).
我们传扬他，是用诸般的智慧劝戒个人、教导个人，要把个人在基督里完完全全地引到神面前。我也为此劳苦，照着他在我里面运用的大能，尽心竭力。（1：28-29）
b. But mentoring is not anything we can do in our own power. What do these verses say about the importance of involving the Spirit in the work of mentoring?
辅导不能依靠我们自己的力量。以下这些经文说出了圣灵在辅导工作中有怎样的重要性？
i. Philippians 2:13, It is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.
腓2：13，因为你们立志行事，都是神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。
ii. 1 Corinthians 12:3 No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
林前12：3，若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说耶稣是主的。
iii. Romans 10:17, Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
罗10：17，可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。
iv. Psalm 119:9-16, How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands. I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. Praise be to you, O LORD; teach me your decrees. With my lips I recount all the laws that come from your mouth. I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches. I meditate on your precepts and consider your ways. I delight in your decrees; I will not neglect your word.
诗119：9-16，少年人用什么洁净他的行为呢？是要遵行你的话。我一心寻求了你，求你不要叫我偏离你的命令。我将你的话藏在心里，免得我得罪你。耶和华啊，你是应当称颂的！求你将你的律例教训我。我用嘴唇传扬你口中的一切典章。我喜悦你的法度，如同喜悦一切的财物。我要默想你的训词，看中你的道路。我要在你的律例中自乐，我不忘记你的话。
c. How will a mentor put this Scriptural principal into practice?
一个辅导者怎样运用这些经文中的原则？
2. Empowered by Prayer由祷告推动。
a. Paul sincerely wanted the Christians at Philippi to grow in their relationship with Jesus and to become mentors of still others. Notice his prayer for them.
保罗真诚期望腓利比的信徒在与耶稣的关系上长进，并成为更多人的辅导者。请注意保罗怎样为他们祷告？
i. God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ – to the glory and praise of God (Philippians 1:8-11).
腓1：8-11，我体会基督耶稣的心肠，切切地想念你们众人，这是神可以给我作见证的。我所祷告的，就是要你们的爱心，在知识和各样见识上多而又多，使你们能分别是非，作诚实无过的人，直到基督的日子；并靠着耶稣基督结满了仁义的果子，叫荣耀称赞归于神。
(1) What is at the heart of Paul’s prayer?保罗祷告的中心是什么？
(2) What two things does he want to happen as the result of his prayer?
他希望他的祷告能产生的两个结果是什么？
(3) If we follow Paul’s example, what will our prayer life be like for the believers we mentor?
如果我们遵从保罗的榜样，我们当怎样为辅导者祷告，应该有怎样的祷告生活？
(a) What will we pray for? 我们将为哪些事情祷告？
(b) How will we structure our mentoring so we become tools in gaining our desired answer to our prayer?
我们将怎样组织我们的辅导，使我们可以得到祷告所祈求的答案？
3. Empowered by Exemplifying Christian Leadership通过展现基督徒领袖的榜样推动。
a. Paul urged Timothy to train the next generation of Christians leaders just as Timothy was trained by Paul.
保罗督促提摩太，要他按照保罗培养他的方式，培养下一代的基督徒领袖。
i. The things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others (2 Timothy 2:2).
你在许多见证人目前听见我所教训的，也要交托那忠心能教导别人的人。（提后2；2）
ii. The training of future generations of Christian leaders is now our responsibility.
培养未来一代的基督徒领袖，现在是我们的责任。
b. No one can teach what he hasn’t learned for himself. No doubt that’s why God is insistent that people who lead in his kingdom must practice their faith. Consider God’s character description of a Christian leader in 1 Timothy 3:2-7. Notice the things God says are essential for a Christian leader to have mastered.
没有人能把自己没学过的东西教给别人。毫无疑问，那就是为什么神坚持，他国度里的领袖必须实践他们的信仰。留意神在提前3：2-7中对基督徒领袖品格的描述。注意神要求基督徒应具备的品格要素。
i. Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.
提前3：2-7，作监督的，必须无可指责，只作一个妇人的丈夫，有节制，自守、端正，乐意接待远人，善于教导；不因酒滋事、不打人，只要温和，不争竞、不贪财；好好管理自己的家，使儿女凡事端庄、顺服。人若不知道管理自己的家，焉能照管神的教会呢？初入教的不可作监督，恐怕他自高自大，就落在魔鬼所受的刑罚里。监督也必须在教外有好名声，恐怕被人毁谤，落在魔鬼的网罗里。
ii. What would you consider to be the five most important characteristics in this list? Explain your choices.
你认为上面提到的事项中，哪五个品质最重要？解释你的选择。
c. God has not given us this character description of a leader primarily to eliminate anyone from leadership, but to spur us on to authentic Christian leadership. That’s why it is not appropriate for us to look at the type of leader God wants and reason, “I’m not like that. God doesn’t want me to lead.” Rather God’s description urges us on to become an exemplary Christian so we can lead and in that way better honor him for his grace.
神把有关基督徒领袖的品格向我们解释说明，并不是要我们把任何人从领袖的圈子内删除，而是为了激励我们成为真正的基督徒领袖。这就是为什么我们不应看着神想要的那类领袖然后推理说：“我不象那类领袖，神不想让我作领袖。”实际上神的描述激励我们进步成为一个模范基督徒，从而能够领导他人，并以此为他的名荣耀他。
i. Where do you especially need to improve in your walk with the Savior?
在与救主同行中，你在什么地方需要作出特别改进？
ii. Is there someone who might mentor you in that area?
有没有人可以在那个方面给你指导？
iii. When will you ask for his help?你将在什么时候向他提出帮助的请求？
Mentoring Requires Trust in God’s Timetable辅导需要信靠神的时间表
4. The Spirit is the one who brings about spiritual growth through the means of grace. Put in your own words how Paul explains to the Corinthians that no mentor can take credit for another Christians’ walk with the Lord.
圣灵透过恩典的途径带来属灵的成长。用自己的话说出保罗怎样向哥林多信徒解释，辅导者不可将另一位信徒与神同行的功劳归于自己。
a. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor. For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building (1 Corinthians 3:7-9).
林前3：7-9，可见栽种的算不得什么，浇灌的也算不得什么；只有那叫他生长的神。栽种的和浇灌的，都是一样。但将来个人要照自己的工夫得自己的赏赐。因为我们是与神同工的；你们是神所栽种的田地，所建造的房屋。
b. This passage also talks about being willing to adapt to God’s timetable for Christian growth as each Christian responds to God’s grace in his own unique way. What did you learn here about trusting God’s timetable?
这段经文也谈到，当每一位基督徒以自己特有的方式回应神的恩典时，他乐意服从神对基督徒灵命成长的时间安排。你对信靠神的时间表有什么领受？
c. How might the following issues cause a mentor to become frustrated with God's timetable for another believer's growth?
在另一位信徒的成长方面，下面的问题可能会怎样导致一个辅导者对神的时间表丧失信心？
i. Fear that he (the mentor) is not doing an adequate job.
担心他（辅导者）所做的工作不够。
ii. Frustration that he has wasted his time and energy.
懊恼自己白白浪费了时间和精力。
iii. Desire to make the person he is mentoring like him.期望他辅导的人喜欢他。
iv. Feeling it is up to him to make the person he is mentoring change.
感觉被辅导者的变化是他决定的。
v. Pride he knows how the mentoring process should work in this person's life.
自豪地以为，他知道辅导过程将在被辅导者的生命中怎样进行。
vi. Feeling he lacks whatever it takes to mentor another.
感觉自己缺乏辅导他人所需的一切。
vii. Any other issue you might want to add:你想补充的任何可能有的问题。
d. Below is a list of ways a mentor may deal with roadblocks to mentoring. Evaluate their value.
下面是辅导者在辅导过程中可能使用的清除障碍的方法。评述其中的价值。
i. With repentance.悔改。
ii. With continued and increased use of the means of grace.
不断并且增加对恩典途径的使用。
iii. By giving up on mentoring.放弃辅导。
iv. By asking another Christian to help him work through these issues.
请求其他基督徒帮助解决这些问题。
v. By asking God for help with these issues.祈求神的帮助解决这些问题。
vi. By asking the Lord to change his heart.求神改变他的心。
vii. By choosing to act on God's promises, not his own feelings.
选择依靠神的应许来行动，而不是凭自己的感觉。
Conclusion结论
1. The Savior did not wait for Peter, Zacchaeus, the Samaritan woman, or anyone else to come to him. He took the initiative and invited them to follow.
