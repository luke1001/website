圣灵：作为教会的建造者
THE HOLY SPIRIT: HIS WORK AS CHURCH BUILDER
圣灵：作为教会的建造者
Introduction: The Holy Spirit, the silent partner, like a good pair of eyeglasses. The Holy Spirit inspired the Holy Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21).  He is the faith worker and the faith builder and keeper through the Word of God, the Bible.
简介：圣灵，静默的同工，恰似一对合适的眼镜。圣灵默示圣经话语（提摩太后书 3:16; 彼得后书 1:21）祂是信实的工人、信实的建造者、藉着神话语即圣经的持守者。        
Question:  Since there is only one Bible, how come there are so many different Christian churches with different teachings?  Which is the true, saving church?        
问题：既然仅有一本圣经，那为什么会有这么多不同的基督教会、传讲不同的教训？哪一个是真正得救的教会呢？                
I. THE CHURCH  (The Holy Christian Church, the Communion of Saints)  I. 教会（圣而公之教会，圣徒相通）
Ekklesia (Gr.) – church, literally “the called out ones”  This word is used 79 times in the New Testament. In some cases it refers to the Holy Christian Church and in other cases it refers to physical gatherings of people in places.  In every case, whether referring to the invisible or visible church, it is called “ekklesia” because of the true believers in its midst who have been “called out” of this sinful world to be members of the Kingdom of God.        
Ekklesia (Gr.) –教会，字面的意思作“召出来的”解。这个词在新约圣经中被使用了79次。有些地方是指圣而公之教会而在其它地方特指那些聚集在一处的人们。无论何种情形下，无论指代可见还是不可见的教会，之所以被称为“ekklesia”，是因为存在于他其中的那些真信徒，他们从罪恶的世界中被“召出来的”成为了上帝国度里的子民。
The Church is called Holy and Christian because of Christ’s redeeming work.  Ephesians 5:25-27Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her [26] to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, [27] and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. See also I Corinthians 3:11 and Ephesians 2:20.  NOTE: In the Bible the Church is also referred to as “the Bride of Christ” and Jesus is the bridegroom.
教会被称为圣而公之教会是因为基督的救赎之工。以弗所书 5:25-27节 你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子；正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己，[26]要用水藉着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁，[27]可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污、皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。  请参看哥林多前书 3:11和以弗所书 2:20。 注意：在圣经中教会也被喻为“基督的新妇”，而耶稣是新郎。
All true believers and only true believers in Jesus belong to The Holy Christian Church.  John 3:36    Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."
只有那些在基督里的真信徒归属于圣而公之教会。约翰福音 3:36 信子的人有永生；不信子的人得不着永生， 神的震怒常在他身上。”
Membership in the Holy Christian Church is “by faith alone in Jesus”…all true believers are known only by God.  It is, in this sense, an invisible church:   2 Timothy 2:19  Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: "The Lord knows those who are his,"        
圣而公之教会中的会众是“单靠在耶稣里的信心”…只有        神知道所有的真信徒。在此意义上就是指不可见的教会：提摩太后书 2:19   然而 神坚固的根基立住了；上面有这印记说：“主认识谁是他的人，”
Ephesians 2:8-9  Grace alone = salvation     For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- [9] not by works, so that no one can boast.
以弗所书 2:8-9 唯独恩典=救恩   你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信，这并不是出于自己，乃是 神所赐的；[9]也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。
II. CHURCHES II.普世教会
Visible gatherings, people gathered around the Word of God  Matthew 18:20 For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."
可见的集会，人们聚集在神的话语前 马太福音 18:20 “因为无论在哪里，有两三个人奉我的名聚会，那里就有我在他们中间。”
Membership in visible churches may consist of true believers and unbelievers (hypocrites)    Matthew 13:47-49 "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. [48] When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. [49] This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.”
会众在可见的教会中可能由真信徒和不信的人（假冒伪善的人） 马太福音 13:47-49 “天国又好象网撒在海里，聚拢各样水族；[48]网既满了，人就拉上岸来，坐下，拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了。[49]世界的末了也要这样；天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来，”
Why go to church?   Is it important or necessary?      Hebrews 10:24-25  And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. [25] Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
为什么去教会？这是重要或必须的吗？ 希伯来书 10:24-25 又要彼此相顾，激发爱心，勉励行善。[25]你们不可停止聚会，好象那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。
III. THREE CAUSES FOR DIFFERENT TEACHINGS IN VISIBLE CHURCHES (See attachment)
III.在可见的教会里造成不同教导的三种原因（见附件）
The Bible + the traditions of the church        圣经 + 教会的传统
The Bible + human reason        圣经 + 人的理性
The Bible Alone        唯独圣经

IV.  TEST THE SPIRITS AND SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES IV.  试验诸灵和查考圣经
I John 4:1    Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
约翰一书 4:1 亲爱的弟兄啊，一切的灵，你们不可都信，总要试验那些灵是出于 神的不是；因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。
Acts 17:11   Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
使徒行传 17:11 这地方的人贤于帖撒罗尼迦的人，甘心领受这道，天天考查圣经，要晓得这道是与不是。
The most profound work of the Holy Spirit…to confess with a heart of faith: “Jesus loves me, this I know…For the Bible tells me so!”
圣灵最深刻的工作…用信心承认：“耶稣爱我，万不错……因有圣书告诉我！”

THE THIRD ARTICLE OF THE APOSTLES CREED
使徒信经第三条
I believe in the Holy Spirit;  the holy Christian church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins;  the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting.  Amen.
我信圣灵；我信圣而公之教会，我信圣徒相通；我信罪得赦免；我信身体复活；我信永生。阿门。
What does this mean?        这是什么意思？
I believe that I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him.
我相信我不能靠自己的思想或抉择来信我主耶稣基督，或来到祂面前。
But the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.
但圣灵透过福音召我，以恩典启示我，将我分别为圣并保守我在真实的信仰里。同样，祂呼召、聚集、启示，分别为圣整个在地上的基督教会，并保守她和耶稣基督在同一的真实信仰里。
In this Christian church He daily and fully forgives all sins to me and all believers.
在这个基督教会里祂每日完全的赦免我和众信徒的所有罪。
On the Last Day He will raise me and all the dead and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ.
到那日祂要使我和所有的死人复活，并赐予我和在基督里的众信徒永远的生命。
This is most certainly true.        这是真实可靠的。
