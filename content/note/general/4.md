Means of Grace
恩典的工具
2 Corinthians 5:19  God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them.
哥林多后书5:19 这就是神在基督里叫世人与自己和好，不将他们的过犯归到他们身上。
1 John 2:2   He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
约翰一书 2:2他为我们的罪作了挽回祭。不是单为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪。
Jesus paid for every sin of everyone who will ever live.   In Jesus God has pronounced everyone not guilty (objective or universal justification, justification declared for all).   
耶稣为过去，现在和将来的每个人都赎了罪。在耶稣里神已经宣布每个人无罪（客观的或普世的称义，对所有的人称义）。
Ephesians 2:8 It is by grace you have been saved, through faith.
以弗所书 2:8 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信。
Acts 16:31 They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”
使徒行传 16: 31 他们说，当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。
Romans 4:24   God will credit righteousness... [to] us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
罗马书4:24 也是为我们将来得算为义之人写的。就是我们这信神使我们的主耶稣从死里复活的人。
Romans 5:1     Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
罗马书5:1我们既因信称义，就藉着我们的主耶稣基督，得与神相和。
Hebrews 11:6 Without faith it is impossible to please God.
希伯来书11:6 人非有信就不能得神的喜悦。
Although Jesus has forgiven all sins for all people for all times, we only receive his forgiveness when God brings us to believe Jesus is our Savior (subjective or personal justification, justification for me).
虽然耶稣已经赦免了所有时代的所有人的罪，但只有当神领我们归主，相信耶稣是我们的救主时我们才接受他的赦免。（主观的或个人的称义，为我称义）
Ephesians 2:1,2    You were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom
of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
以弗所书2:1-2 你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。那时你们在其中行事为人随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵
John 6:44       No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.
约翰福音6:44 若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有能到我这里来的
Ephesians 2:8,9    For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith– and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God– not by works, so that no one can boast.
以弗所书2:8,9 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信，这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的。也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。
1 Corinthians 2:14         The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him.
哥林多前书 2:14 然而属血气的人不领会神圣灵的事，反倒以为愚拙。并且不能知道，因为这些事惟有属灵的人才能看透。
Romans 1:16   I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.
罗马书1:16 我不以福音为耻。这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的。
Romans 10:17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
罗马书10:17 可见信道是从听道来的，听道是从基督的话来的。
We are not able to bring ourselves to faith in Jesus. People who are spiritually dead cannot make any moves in God’s direction. By the same grace that sent Jesus to be our Savior, the Holy Spirit brings us to faith in Jesus as our Savior. He works this miracle through the power of the gospel, the good news we are right with God through Jesus. That gospel is found in God’s Word and sacraments.
我们无法引领自己信仰耶稣。灵性已死的人是无法向神的方向前进。藉着差派耶稣为我们的救主的同样恩典，圣灵引领我们相信耶稣是我们的救主。他通过福音的大能行使神迹，这福音就是我们因着耶稣与神和好。这福音就在神的话语和圣礼中。
Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed.
提摩太后书3:16 圣经都是神所默示的。
2 Peter 1:21     For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
彼得后书 1:21 因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动说出神的话来。
Although written by human beings, the Bible is actually God’s inspired message to human beings. It is exactly the message God wanted humans to know about him. It contains no errors.
虽然圣经为人类所写，它实际上是神向人类默示的信息。它正是神要人类认识他的信息。它是正确无误的。
John 17:17 [Jesus said to his Father,] Your word is truth.
约翰福音17:17 求你用真理使他们成圣。你的道就是真理。
1 Peter 1:24,25     For all men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers, and the flowers fall, but the word of the Lord stands
forever.
彼得前书 1:24,25 因为凡有血气的，尽都如草，他的美荣，都像草上的花。草必枯乾，花必凋谢。惟有主的道是永存的。所传给你们的福音就是这道。
Matthew 26:56     “This has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”
马太福音26:56 但这一切的事成就了，为要应验先知书上的话。
Psalm 119:45,52,105     I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts. I remember your ancient laws, O Lord, and I find comfort in them. Your word
is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.
诗篇119：４５我要自由而行（或作“我要行在宽阔之地”），因我素来考究你的训词。５２耶和华啊！我记念你从古以来的典章，就得了安慰。１０５你的话是我脚前的灯，是我路上的光。　
We know the Bible is God’s Word because of (1) the Bible’s claims about itself, (2) the testimony of Jesus, (3) the hundreds of fulfilled prophecies, (4) its effect on our lives.
我们知道圣经是神的话语因为（1）圣经这样告诉我们，(2)耶稣的见证，(3)许许多多的实现的预言，(4)对我们人生的影响。
Galatians 2:20 The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
加拉太书 2:20 现在活着的，不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着。并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信神的儿子而活，他是爱我，为我舍己。
Matthew 4:4    Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
马太福音 4:4 耶稣却回答说，经上记着说，人活着，不是单靠食物，乃是靠神口里所出的一切话。
Ephesians 6:16     Take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
以弗所书 6:16 此外又拿着信德当作藤牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭。
John 8:47    “He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”
约翰福音 8:47 出于神的，必听神的话。你们不听，因为你们不是出于神。
Because God uses the Bible to communicate with us and it is through his Word that he brings us to faith and strengthens our faith, Christians will make the study of his Word a top priority. Christians will trust that Word more than they trust scientists or philosophers, more than they trust their own emotions or experiences.
因为神用圣经与我们沟通，并通过他的话语引领我们相信和加固我们的信心，所以基督徒要以学习神的话语为首位。与科学和哲学相比，与他们的感情和经验相比，基督徒要更相信神的话，

A. In order not to be condemned you must make a choice – you must choose to believe.... (God) gives you the Holy Spirit to convict you of your need..., but even after all of this, it is your decision whether to accept God’s free pardon or to continue in your lost condition....   If you are willing to make this decision and have received Jesus Christ as your own Lord and Savior, then you have become a child of God in whom Jesus Christ dwells.
● Dr. Billy Graham, How to be Born Again, p. 193, 202
A．为了不被定罪你必须做个决定—你必须选择相信...（神）让圣灵指明你的需要...，但即使如此，是你决定是否接受神的特赦或继续你迷失的处境...如果你愿意做决定，并且已接受耶稣为你的神和救主，那么你已经成为为神的孩子，耶稣基督就居住在你里面。
比利·葛培理博士，如何重生，p. 193, 202
B. We must not judge by what we feel or by what we see before us. The Word must be followed, and we must firmly hold that these truths are to be believed, not experienced; for to believe is not to experience.... The Word must be believed even when we feel and experience what differs entirely from the Word.                                                                   
● Martin Luther commenting on Psalm130:7
B．我们不应该靠感觉或眼前所见去判断。必须跟从神的话，我们一定要坚定持守所信的，而非经验得来的真理；因为相信不是经验。。。一定要相信神的话即使我们的感觉和经验完全不同于神的话。
马丁· 路德对诗篇130：7的评论
C. Remember,
•  it is not your hold of Christ that saves you – it is Christ;
•  it is not your joy in Christ that saves you – it is Christ;
•  it is not even faith in Christ, though that is the instrument that saves you – it is Christ’s blood and merits.
Therefore,
• look not so much to your hand with which you art grasping Christ, look to Christ;
• look not to your hope, but to Jesus, the source of your hope;
• look not to your faith, but to Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith.
● Charles Spurgeon,1834 –1892; On Hebrews 12:2
C．记住，
不是你持守基督拯救你---是基督；
不是你在基督里的喜乐拯救你---是基督；
甚至不是你在基督里的信仰，虽然它是拯救你的手段---是基督的宝血和美德
因此，
不要盯着你抓住基督的手，仰望基督；
不要盯着你的希望，仰望基督，你希望的源泉；
不要盯着你的信心，仰望基督，你信心的造就者和成全者。
查尔斯·司布真，1834 –1892;；关于希伯来书12：2
D.The Bible doctrine is simply this that when Christ died for our sins, i.e., for the sins of the whole world, God declared the whole world forgiven (justified) and now
God wants us to believe this. Others say: Believe, and thou shalt be justified. God says: Believe that thou hast been justified. And the thing is as simple as that but
what a difference when death stares a person in the face ● Sigurd Christian Ylvisaker, 1884-1959
D．圣经教义就是这样：当基督为我们，即整个世界，的罪而死的时候，神宣告了整个世界已被赦免（称义），现在神要我们相信这点。其他人说：相信，你就能称义。神说：相信你已经称义。事情就这么简单，但是当一个人面对死亡时是多么不同。西格德克里斯琴伊尔维萨克，1884-1959 Sacraments
Like the word Trinity or Triune, sacrament is not found in the Scriptures. In the Scriptures, however, it is apparent that God describes himself in a unique way. So the term triune (three in one) was developed to capture that description. In the same way, when the Bible speaks about Lord’s Supper and Baptism, we recognize that the Spirit is describing unique spiritual gifts he intends for Christians to enjoy and find comfort in. So early Church Fathers coined the term sacrament to capture that teaching.
A sacrament is:
● a sacred act
● instituted (started) by Christ
● that uses earthly elements (water, bread and wine)
● that is connected with God’s Word
● that offers forgiveness of sins
A sacrament is primarily and most importantly something that God does for us: assures us of forgiveness.
A sacrament is not primarily a law or “ordinance” that a Christian is required to do in order to confess faith in Jesus.
Among rituals that the New Testament mentions or that have been practiced in the Christian Church, only Baptism and Lord’s Supper fit the five criteria listed above. For that reason, conscientious Christians apply the term sacrament only to those two rites.
圣礼
像三位一体一词一样，圣经里找不到圣礼一词。然而，在圣经里，显然神以独特方法描述自己。所以发展了术语“三位一体”（三个成一体）来精炼这个描述的内涵。同样，当圣经谈到主的晚餐和洗礼，我们认识到圣灵在描述神赐予基督徒所喜乐和寻求安慰的独特的属灵礼物。所以，早期教会的神父创造术语“圣礼”来理解这一教导。
圣礼是：
● 一个神圣行动
● 由基督设立（开创）
●使用世间元素（水，面包和酒）
● 与神的话相联系
● 给予罪的宽恕
 圣礼主要和最重要地是神为我们所做的：让我们确信罪得赦免。
 圣礼主要的不是为了承认信仰耶稣而要求基督徒去做的律法或“诫令”。
 在新约提及的仪式或一直在教会执行的仪式中，只有洗礼和圣餐符合以上所列的五个标准。因此，尽职的基督徒只对这两个仪式称为圣礼。
The Sacrament of Baptism
圣洗礼
Matthew 3:11 I baptize you with water.
马太福音3:11 我是用水给你们施洗。
Matthew 28:19     ...baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
马太福音28:19 …奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗
Baptism requires the use of water and the use of God’s Word, particularly the words, “In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”
洗礼要求使用水和神的话语，尤其是“以圣父，圣子，圣灵的名义”这句话。
Ephesians 5:25,26         Christ...gave himself up for her [the church, believers] to make her holy, cleaning her by the washing of water through the word.
以弗所书5:25,26 基督…为教会舍己。要用水藉着道，把教会洗净，成为圣洁，
The power source for baptism is not in the water used in baptism, but only in God’s Word.
洗礼的能量来源不是在洗礼所用的水里，而在神的话语里。
Luke 11:38 But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.
路加福音11:38 这法利赛人看见耶稣饭前不洗手，便诧异。
(The Pharisees) observe many other traditions, such as the washing [Greek word: baptitzo] of cups, pitchers and kettles.
(法利赛人) 遵守许多其它传统，比如水杯，水壶，水罐的清洗（希腊语：baptitzo），
The Greek word for baptize means wash. That washing can be done in a variety of ways. Christian freedom, therefore, allows the water of baptism to be applied by wiping, pouring, dripping, and immersing (partially or totally) in water.
洗礼在希腊文里是洗的意思。洗是可以用多种方法完成。因此，用水洗礼，可以自由选择擦，浇，点和浸水(部分或完全地)的方式进行。
Matthew 28:19     Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them.
马太福音28:19 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。
Baptism is intended for “all nations.” No Scripture passage restricts the use of baptism to any gender, race, or age category.
洗礼是为“万民”设立。没有圣经章节对洗礼在任何关于性别，种族，或年龄划分上有限制。
Acts 2:41    Those who accepted his message were baptized.
使徒行传2:41 于是领受他们的人，就受了洗。
Acts 8:12    When they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and
women.
使徒行传8:12 及至他们信了腓利所传神国的福音，和耶稣基督的名，连男带女就受了洗。
When baptism was administered to adults, New Testament practice was to be sure that they believed the gospel and understood the importance of baptism.
当给成人施洗时，新约的常规是要确信他们相信福音并理解洗礼的重要性
Matthew 18:6 ...These little ones [micron] who believe in me.
Note also how the preborn John the Baptist in Luke 1:41, 44 responds to the presence of the preborn Jesus.
马太福音18: 6 …这信我的一个小子 (原文是小子们)。
同样留意路加福音1:41,44中出生前的施洗约翰怎样回应出生前的耶稣的。
Matthew 28:19 Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them.
马太福音28:19 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。
Acts 2:38,39 Repent and be baptized,... for the forgiveness of
your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children.
使徒行传 2:38,39 (彼得说,) 你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵。因为这应许是给你们，和你们的儿女…
Genesis 17:12,13 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised.... My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting
covenant.
你们世世代代的男子…生下来第八日，都要受割礼。…这样，我的约就立在你们肉体上做永远的约。
Colossians 2:11,12 In him you were also circumcised,...having been buried with him in baptism....
歌罗西书(Colossians) 第2章第11，12段
你们在他里面，也受了不是人手所行的割礼，乃是基督使你们脱去肉体情欲的割礼。你们既受洗与他一同埋葬，也就在此与他一同复活。都因信那叫他从死里复活神的功用。 Acts 16:29-34 The jailer...fell trembling before Paul and Silas ... and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household.” Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.... Then immediately he and all his family were baptized.... He was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God -- he and his whole family.
使徒行传16:29,34 禁卒叫人拿灯来，就跳进去，战战竞竞的，俯伏在保罗西拉面前。又领他们出来说，二位先生，我当怎样行才能得救。他们说，当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。他们就把主的道，讲给他和他全家的人听。当夜就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤。他和属乎他的人，立时都受了洗。于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭，他和全家，因为信了神，都很喜乐。
Psalm 51:5 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time mymother conceived me.
诗篇51:5 我是在罪孽里生的。在我母胎的时候，就有了罪。
1 Peter 3:21     This water (the water of the Flood) symbolizes baptism that now saves you also.... It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
彼得前书3:21 这水所表明的洗礼，现在藉着耶稣基督复活。也拯救你。
Matthew 28:19     Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them.
马太福音28:19 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。
We baptize even the smallest of children because (1) they are able to believe; (2) they are part the people Jesus commanded are to be baptized; (3) the promised gift of the Spirit through baptism is for children; (4) baptism replaces the Old Testament sacrament of circumcision; (5) the early church included infants and children; (6) every child is sinful from conception and needs a Savior; (7) God promises that through baptism we are brought to faith in Jesus and saved; and (8) we are commanded to baptize “all nations.”
我们甚至给最小的孩子施洗因为（1）他们能相信；（2）他们是耶稣命令要受洗的人中的一部份；(3) 通过洗礼得到的神应许的圣灵的礼物也是为孩子们预备的；（4）洗礼替代旧约的割礼；（5）早期教会包括婴孩和儿童；（6）每个孩子在母腹中就有罪并需要救主；(7)神应许通过洗礼使我们相信耶稣并得救；（8）神命令我们为“万民”施洗。
Acts 22:16 Be baptized and wash your sins away.
使徒行传 22:16 (求告他的名)受洗，洗去你的罪。
Mark 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
马可福音1:16 信而受洗的必然得救。不信的必被定罪。
1 Peter 3:21     This water (the water of the Flood) symbolizes baptism that now saves you also.... It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
彼得前书3:21 这水所表明的洗礼，现在藉着耶稣基督复活。也拯救你们。
Baptism saves us by bringing us to faith in Jesus. It does not provide an alternate way to be saved. Baptism cannot save us if we reject Jesus as our Savior.
洗礼通过使我们相信耶稣拯救我们。它不提供一个可交替的得救的方法。如果我们拒绝耶稣为救主，洗礼不能拯救我们。
Romans 1:16   [The gospel] is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.
罗马书 1:16 我不以福音为耻。这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的…
Matthew 28:19     Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them.
马太福音28:19 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。
1 Corinthians 14:40 Everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
哥林多前书14:40 凡事都要规规矩矩的按着次序行。
The power of baptism depends on the gospel’s ability to create spiritual life within us and not on the faith of the person doing the baptizing. Although every Christian has the right to baptize, for the sake of good order, baptisms are usually done by the pastor at a Christian’s church.  
洗礼的能力是依靠福音的大能来创造属灵的生命而不是依靠受洗人的信心。虽然每个基督徒有权施洗，为了有良好次序，施洗通常在教会由牧师进行。
Galatians 3:27 For all of you who were baptized into Christ have been [note verb tense] clothed with Christ.
加拉太书 3:27 你们受洗归入基督的，都是(已经)披戴基督了。(注意时态)
Romans 6:4     We were therefore buried with him [Jesus] through baptism...that we too may live a new life.
罗马书6:4 所以，我们藉着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督藉着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。
In baptism God makes an eternal commitment to us. He puts his name on us and claims us as his own. He clothes us in Jesus. He testifies that we were buried with Jesus and we also rose from the dead with Jesus. We have God’s promise that not only as we saved from our sins, but we are transformed to live God pleasing lives.
在洗礼中神向我们做了永远的承诺。他把他的名放我们上面，并认领我们。他给我们披戴耶稣。他见证我们与耶稣一同埋葬并与耶稣从死里复活。我们有神的应许，不仅把我们从罪里拯救，而且改造我们去活出神喜悦的生命。

A.On the History of Infant Baptism
婴孩洗礼的历史
“The ordinance of Baptism receives several illustrations from the monumental evidences of the Catacombs. There are numerous epitaphs of neophytes– a term applied only to newly baptized persons–which indicate that this Christian rite was administered at all ages from tender infancy to adult years . . .” One of many examples is: “Candidis, a neophyte, who lived twenty-one months’” (Withrow, W.H. The Catacombs of Rome and Their Testimony Relative to Primitive Christianity. 6th ed. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1895, pp. 532-533.)
There is also much other archaeological evidence which overwhelmingly testifies to the practice of infant Baptism in the early Church, such as a fragment of a tombstone for a child who died very young, likely less than a month old, which describes the child as, “The Most Blessedly Bathed” (Inscriptiones Latinae Christianae Veteres, I:1520). Another example is from about 206 A.D. in a North African tombstone inscription from Hadrumetum which indicates that this child who died nine hours after birth had been baptized (Inscriptiones Latinae Christianae Veteres, II:4429-A).
A 婴孩受洗的历史
“从地下墓穴的纪念碑的证明提供洗礼的习惯的几个例证。有许多新入教者的墓志铭---一个专用于刚受洗的人的术语---显示这个基督徒仪式是“
对于所有年龄的人执行从幼年到成年。。。“其中一个例子是：“坎迪迪，新入教，在世21个月。”（威斯罗，W。H。罗马地下墓穴和他们相对于早期基督教的见证。第六版伦敦：霍德和斯托顿，1895，pp.532-533.）
有如此之多的考古证据以不可抗拒的事实证明在早期教会给婴孩洗礼的习惯，比如有块幼年死去的孩子的墓碑的碎片，孩子可能不到一个月大，这样描述孩子，“最受祝福的洗礼”（Inscriptiones Latinae Christianae Veteres, I:1520))另一个例子是大约 公元206年，在北非哈德鲁曼特姆的一块墓碑碑铭显示这个才出生9个小时就死了的孩子死前接受了洗礼(Inscriptiones Latinae Christianae Veteres, II:4429-A).
B.Age of Accountability
Some Christians maintain that God does not hold human beings accountable for their sins until they reach a certain point in their lives called the “age of accountability.”
Scripture does teach an age of discretion (See Deuteronomy 1:39; Isaiah 7:15,16; Jonah 4:11). This refers to a spiritual and moral maturity a person gains as he or she grows up and is trained in God’s Word. This discretion is something a person will use to prepare for receiving the Lord’s Supper. It will enable the person to “examine himself” before reception (1 Corinthians 11:28).
However, the “age of discretion” is different from the “age of accountability.” Nowhere does Scripture say that those who have not yet attain the age of discretion are not accountable to God for their sins. Much the opposite, Romans 3:19 insists "the whole world [is] held accountable to God" for its sinfulness and this accountability begins at conception (Psalm 51:5, Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me”).
When it comes to the spiritual life of infants and young children, we can give thanks for the sacrament of baptism which works faith in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. An infant cannot verbalize such a faith, and yet saving faith in Christ is not always something we consciouslythink about. It is simply something that receives what God offers and gives through the gospel, whether that gospel come in the form of the spoken Word or through the sacrament of baptism.
B．问责年龄
某些基督徒主张神不会追究人的罪，直到他们成长到生命中称之为“问责年龄”的某时刻。
圣经的确教导一个懂事（判断力）年龄（读申命记1：39；以赛亚书7:15,16;约拿书4:11).这是指一个人，当他或她成长时获得灵性的和道德的成熟，并在神的话语里得以造就。人用这个懂事具有的判断力来预备领受圣餐。它使人在接受前“监察自己”。（哥林多前书11：28）
然而，“懂事年龄”不同于“问责年龄。”圣经中没有一处说未达到懂事年龄的人不用为他们的罪负责。更相反，罗马书3：19强调“叫普世的人都伏在神的审判之下。”因为他们的罪性和问责开始于母腹（诗篇51:5,我是在罪孽里生的，在我母亲怀胎的时候，就有了罪。“）
当我们谈到婴儿和儿童的属灵生命，我们感谢圣洗礼为了使我们罪得赦免在基督的信心上做功。一个婴儿不能描述这个信心，然而在基督里得救的信心不是我们能有意识地思考。它完全是神通过福音提供和赐给我们，不管福音以口头传播神的话语的形式或通过圣洗礼。
C. Baptism signifies that the sinful nature in us should be overcome by godly sorrow and repentance day after day, and that all its evil deeds and desires be put to death. It also signifies that a new person should daily arise to live before God in righteousness and purity forever.
● Martin Luther, What Baptism Means for our Daily Lives
洗礼意味着通过每天虔诚的内疚和悔改，我们具有的罪的本性得以克服，并治死所有邪恶的行为和欲望。它还意味着一个新人每天以纯洁，充满正义的面貌展现在神面前。
●马丁路德，洗礼对于我们日常生活的意义
D. What happens to children who die without being baptized? The Bible tells us of only one way anyone (including infants) can be right with God, that is, through faith in Jesus. However, that does not mean unbaptized child are not saved. We are bound by God to use Baptism as a means of grace, but God is not. In addition, in Christian homes, that child – even as a preborn child – was exposed to the powerful, faith-generating Word of God. Parents who have lost unbaptized children will trust God's mercy.
But Christian parents find comfort not only in God’s immeasurable mercy but also in his righteousness. God can never do anything wrong. For example, in Genesis 18 Abraham talked with God about the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. During his intercession, Abraham appealed to God’s righteousness, “Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (vs. 25). To Abraham, it was an impossibility that God would send destruction and wrath upon those who did not deserve it. He challenged God that a righteous Judge would certainly do right. In response, God promised to acknowledge the existence of those who were righteous and not to destroy the cities if even ten could be found who had not conformed to wickedness. Unfortunately, ten faithful people could not be found. Even then, however, God proved his righteousness by saving Lot and his daughters from destruction.
D．没有受洗的孩子死后会发生什么？圣经告诉我们只有一种方法任何人（包括婴儿）可以和神在一起，那就是相信耶稣基督。然而，并非说未经洗礼的孩子不得救。神赐给我们用洗礼作为恩典的工具，但神不受限制。另外，在基督徒家庭里，儿童----即使出生前的孩子---- 置身于有威力的，产生信心的神的话语中。失去未受洗的孩子的父母要相信神的仁慈。
但基督徒父母不仅在神无限仁慈中找到安慰，也在他的公义中得安慰。神从不犯错，比如，在创世记18章，亚伯拉罕和神谈论所多玛和蛾摩拉的迫在眉睫的毁灭时。他向神求情，亚伯拉罕呼吁神的公义“审判全地的主、岂不行公义么？”。对亚伯拉罕来说，神不可能降毁灭和愤怒于无辜的人。他向神挑战说一个正义的法官当然做正确的事。神回应，应许如果即使能找到十个不作恶的人，他将留下那些正义的人，不毁灭那城。不幸的是，连十个守信的人都找不到。尽管如此，神仍然救罗得和他的女儿免于毁灭，证明他的公义。
The Sacrament of Lord’s Supper
主的晚餐
Matthew 26:17-28    On the first day of the Feast of Unleaven Bread... Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.... While they were eating, Jesus took bread,
gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, “Drink
from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”
马太福音26:17-28 除酵节的第一天…耶稣(和)十二个门徒坐席…他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说，你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说，你们都喝这个。因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
The celebration of Lord’s Supper began Maundy Thursday evening, the night before Jesus’ death, when he used the celebration of Old Testament Passover to institute (begin) this New Testament sacrament. Lord's Supper is known by other names, Holy Communion ("sharing"), Eucharist ("blessing"), Sacrament of the Altar, Lord's Table, and Holy Supper.
 庆祝主的晚餐开始于耶稣受难的星期四晚上，耶稣死前那晚，他借庆祝旧约逾越节设立新约圣礼。主的晚餐还有其他的名字，也称之为圣餐礼（分享），感恩祭（祝福），祭坛圣礼，主的桌子，和神圣的晚餐。
Matthew 26:27-28    While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.” Then he took the cup, gave thanks
and offered it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”
马太福音26:27,28他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说，你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说，你们都喝这个。因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
1 Corinthians 10:16 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in
the body of Christ?
哥林多前书10:16 我们所祝福的杯，岂不是同领基督的血吗。我们所擘开的饼，岂不是同领基督的身体吗。
The Lord’s Supper is the eating and drinking of bread and wine. Along with bread and wine, one also receives the same body and blood that Jesus gave and shed when he died on the cross.
 主的晚餐是吃饼和喝葡萄酒。伴随饼和酒，领受者得到同样的耶稣舍的身体和宝血，就是耶稣死于十字架上付出和流淌的。
1 Corinthians 11:27-28 Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A
man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.
哥林多前书11:27-28 所以无论何人，不按理吃主的饼，喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身主的血了。人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼，喝这杯。
Hebrews 10:29     How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy
thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
希伯来书10:29 何况人践踏神的儿子，将那使他成圣之约的血当作平常，又亵慢施恩的圣灵，你们想，他要受的刑罚该怎样加重呢。
It is possible to go to Lord’s Supper but not for our blessing. Lord’s Supper is received in an “unworthy manner” when the Christian is not spiritually prepared. When one receives Lord’s Supper this way he is guilty of sinning against the only thing that can forgive his sins.
参加主的晚餐但不得祝福是可能发生的。当基督徒灵里没有准备好时，就是“不按理”领受主的晚餐。一个人这样领受主的晚餐就是干犯唯一
可赦免他的罪的事。
Matthew 26:28     This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
马太福音26:28 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
To be properly prepared to receive Jesus’ meal, the Christian will affirm that he is a sinner and that he is relying on Jesus alone to forgive those sins.
为了正确预备好领受主的晚餐，基督徒要明确自己是罪人而且只有依赖耶稣赦免他的罪。
Luke 22:19,20 This is my body given for you....This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
路加福音22:19,20 这是我的身体，为你们舍的…这杯是用我血所立的新约，是为你们流出来的。
To be properly prepared to receive Jesus’ meal, the Christian will affirm that he will receive Jesus true body and blood along with the bread and wine offer in this meal.
为了正确预备好领受主的晚餐，基督徒要明确他所领受饼和酒时一同得到耶稣的真的身体和宝血。
1 John 3:6 No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
约翰一书3:6 凡住在他里面的，就不犯罪。凡犯罪的，是未曾看见他，也未曾认识他。
Romans 6:1,2 Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means!
罗马书 6:1, 2 …我们可以仍在罪中，叫恩典显多吗？断乎不可!
To be properly prepared to receive Jesus’ meal, the Christian will desire not to go back to the sins for which he seek pardon.
为了正确预备好领受主的晚餐，基督徒要期望不再回到他寻求主原谅的罪中。
1 Corinthians 11:27-29 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of
the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord
eats and drinks judgment on himself.
哥林多前书11:27-29 所以无论何人，不按理吃主的饼，喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身主的血了。人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼，喝这杯。因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的
体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。
2 Thessalonians 3:14-15     If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel
ashamed. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
帖撒罗尼迦后书3:14,15 若有人不听从我们这信上的话，要记下他，不和他交往，叫他自觉羞愧。但不要以他为仇人，要劝他如弟兄。
The Scriptures encourage us to treat others with the same love we have found in God’s grace. Loving others means we will not encourage them to sin. Since it is possible to commit more sin by attending Lord’s Supper in an unworthy way, Christians will restrict this meal only to those who are prepared. People who are unable to properly prepare themselves for this meal, therefore, should not be invited to attend. For example, we would not commune individuals who are insane, suffering from dementia, or uninformed about the miracle of this meal.  Unrepentant Christians will not be invited to Jesus’ meal.
圣经鼓励我们以我们在神的恩典中找到的同样的爱对待别人。爱别人意味着我们鼓励他们不要犯罪。既然不按理领用主的晚餐而犯更多罪是可能发生的，基督徒要只对预备好的人发圣餐。那些没能完全预备好领受圣餐的人不应邀请。比如，我们不可和神经不正常的人，有痴呆症，或对圣餐的奇迹不知道的人交通。不悔改的基督徒将不在邀请之列。
1 Corinthians 10:17 Because (in Lord’s Supper) there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.
哥林多前书10:17 我们虽多，仍是一个饼，一个身体。因为我们都是分受这一个饼。
Romans 16:17 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep
away from them.
罗马书16:17 弟兄们，那些离开你们，叫你们跌倒，背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。
Lord’s Supper also provides Christians with a method of confessing their oneness with faith with those with whom they commune together. Communing together is a statement that those Christians are all part of the same spiritual loaf, that they share the same spiritual ingredients. For that reason Christians will be discerning about the Christian gatherings at which they will commune. If we commune with Christians who believe differently than we do, we give the impression that we are “one loaf” with them, that we agree totally with their beliefs about God. We would not be honest to give that impression. In addition, the Spirit warns believers against allowing themselves to be influenced by those who “cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teachings you have learned.”
主的晚餐还提供基督徒一个方法承认和他们一起交通的基督徒的在信心上合一。共同交通是说那些基督徒是一个面包的一部分，他们分享同样的
灵里的成分。因此基督徒能够分辨与哪些基督徒交通聚会。如果我们与
我们所信不同的基督徒交通，我们感觉是一条面包，我们完全同意他们对神的信仰。有这样的印象我们就不诚实。另外，圣灵警告信徒不要让自己被那些人影响，他们会“导致分歧和设置与你所学的教义相反的路障。“
For those reasons, conscientious Christians and their churches practice “close communion.” That means only those who are close in faith (united in faith) are invited to commune together.  Close communion shows love (1) for those who are “close” by affirming their faith; (2) for Christians of other differing beliefs by encouraging them to examine the items of faith that separate us; (3) for God by respecting his will that we clearly testify to what we believe; (4) for ourselves as we take a stand on what we believe and protect ourselves from misbelief.
因为这些原因，尽职的基督徒和他们的教会执行“内部领圣餐”。它意味着只有那些在一个信仰里（一致的信仰）的人被邀请一起交通。
内部领圣餐显示爱：(1)爱那些通过确定信仰而合一的人；（2）爱信仰上有不同的基督徒，鼓励他们检查在信仰上造成分离的地方；（3）爱神，我们以清楚地见证我们的信仰来尊重他的意愿；（4）爱我们自己，我们持守我们所信立场并保护自己不会误信。
Luke 22:19 This is my body given for you.
路加福音22:19 …这是我的身体，为你们舍的。
Matthew 26:28  This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
马太福音26:28 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。
Matthew 11:28     Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will giveyou rest.
马太福音11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。
John 6:37    Whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
约翰福音6:37 …到我这里来的，我总不丢弃他。
1 Corinthians 11:25,26 Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
哥林多前书11:25, 26 饭后，也照样拿起杯来，说，这杯是用我的血所立的新约。你们每逢喝的时候，要如此行，为的是记念我。你们每逢吃这饼，喝这杯，是表明主的死，直等到他来。
Attending Lord’s Supper is a remarkable blessing. In this meal the Son of God himself touches us in a real and personal way to assure us of forgiveness. In this meal Jesus’ touch tells us of his commitment to us. In this meal we joyfully remember Jesus’ love for us and publicly testify that he is our Savior. For these reasons, a believer will attend communion as often as possible.
参加主的晚餐是个非凡的祝福。在主的晚餐上，神的儿子亲自以真实和个人的方式与我们接触，向我们确保罪的赦免。在主的晚餐上耶稣告诉我们他对我们的许诺。在主的晚餐上，我们满怀喜乐记住神的爱，并公开见证他是我们的救主。为此，一个信徒会尽量多参加领受圣餐。

A. Fasting and other outward preparations may serve a good purpose, but he is properly prepared who believes these words, "Given and poured out for you for the forgiveness of sins." But whoever does not believe these words or doubts them is not prepared, because the words "for you" require nothing but hearts that believe.
● Martin Luther
A 禁食和其他外在的准备可以作为好的目的，但一个人只要相信“为你流出来，使罪得赦。”便已正确地预备好了。而那些不相信这话或怀疑这话的人没有预备好，因为“为你”这话就是要求相信的心。●马丁。路德
B.Attendance at worship and Lord's Supper is usually an accurate barometer of a Christian's relationship with the Savior.
B．参加敬拜和主的晚餐是基督徒和救主的关系的精确气压计。
