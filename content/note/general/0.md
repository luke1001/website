身体的哪部分 What part of the body
Introduction介绍
In the following verses, Jesus is speaking to His disciples (and to us) before His death on the cross. Jesus is instructing the disciples on the necessity of maintaining their spiritual relationship with Him. Jesus wants the disciples (and us) to understand that producing fruit is part of the relationship we have with Him.
在下面的经文中，耶稣在钉十架前和他的门徒（还有我们）说话。耶稣教导门徒与他属灵关系的重要性。耶稣想让门徒（和我们）明白与主相连才能结果子。
John 15: 5-9
5“I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. 6If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. 7If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. 8This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. 9"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.”
约翰福音15：5-9
5 我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子；因为离了我，你们就不能作什么。 6 人若不常在我里面，就象枝子丢在外面枯干，人拾起来，扔在火里烧了。 7 你们若常在我里面，我的话也常在你们里面，凡你们所愿意的，祈求就给你们成就。 8 你们多结果子，我父就因此得荣耀，你们也就是我的门徒了。 9 我爱你们，正如父爱我一样；你们要常在我的爱里。

Take a closer look at verses 5 and 8. They refer to bearing fruit. Name some ways to bear fruit.
再仔细读5节和8节。他们提到了结果子，写下一些结果子的方法。
In the next section, we are going to look at the body of Christ and at the gifts of the Holy Spirit to learn more about how we can bear fruit. In the Bible, the body of Christ is also a reference to the church, or believers in Christ.
在下一节里，我们来看基督的身体和圣灵的恩赐，一起学习更多关于我们如何结果子。圣经中，基督的身体也引申为教会，或者基督徒。
Part 1: What Part of the Body Are You?
第一部分：你是身体哪部分?
The book of Corinthians was a letter written by the Apostle Paul to the Christians that lived in Corinth. This part of the letter was meant to instruct and restore the church, or the believers, in areas of weakness that had developed. Some of the members were arguing over who was more important. Paul is addressing them by using the image of the body. The body is the Church. In this image Jesus Christ is the head of the body, and the individuals are various parts of the body.
哥林多书是使徒保罗写给住在哥林多的基督徒写的信。书信是要教导和重建在一些方面日渐软弱中的教会和信徒。有些人争论谁更重要。保罗用身体的比喻来教导他们。这身体就是教会。在这个比喻中基督耶稣是身体的头，其他信徒是肢体。
1 Corinthians 12: 12-27
林前12：12-27
12The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. 13For we were all baptized byone Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.14Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. 15If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 16And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. 17If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
21The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" 22On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 24while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 25so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 26If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.27Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
12 就如身子是一个，却有许多肢体；而且肢体虽多，仍是一个身子；基督也是这样。 13 我们不拘是犹太人，是希腊人，是为奴的，是自主的，都从一位圣灵受洗，成了一个身体，饮于一位圣灵。 14 身子原不是一个肢体，乃是许多肢体。 15 设若脚说：“我不是手，所以不属乎身子；”它不能因此就不属乎身子； 16 设若耳说：“我不是眼，所以不属乎身子；”它也不能因此就不属乎身子。 17 若全身是眼，从哪里听声呢？若全身是耳，从哪里闻味呢？ 18 但如今　神随自己的意思把肢体俱各安排在身上了。 19 若都是一个肢体，身子在哪里呢？ 20 但如今肢体是多的，身子却是一个。 21 眼不能对手说：“我用不着你；”头也不能对脚说：“我用不着你。” 22 不但如此，身上肢体，人以为软弱的，更是不可少的； 23 身上肢体，我们看为不体面的，越发给它加上体面；不俊美的，越发得着俊美。 24 我们俊美的肢体，自然用不着装饰；但　神配搭这身子，把加倍的体面给那有缺欠的肢体， 25 免得身上分门别类，总要肢体彼此相顾。 26 若一个肢体受苦，所有的肢体就一同受苦；若一个肢体得荣耀，所有的肢体就一同快乐。 27 你们就是基督的身子，并且各自作肢体。
According to verse 12 the church has many parts but --------------------------.
12节中讲教会有许多部分，但是。
What tells us in verse 13 that there is no racial division?------------------ or social distinction? ---------------------
13节中没有宗族分别告诉了我们什么？，没有社会分工不同呢？。
Verses 14-20 were addressed to the members who felt that their gifts/abilities were superior, and to the members who felt that their gifts/abilities were inferior and unimportant. Paul is pointing out that the human body must have diversity to work effectively, so the members of Christ’s body must have diverse gifts to be effective.
14-20节是写给那些自认为恩典能力更高的，和自认恩典能力不足和不重要的。保罗指出人的身体必须有不同才能有效做工，所以作基督身体的必须有不同的恩赐才能有效同工。
Vs.14-17 What are the parts of the body that are mentioned?
14-17节提到了那些肢体？-----------------------------------------------------------------------
What would happen if the individual body parts stop functioning as they should?
如果一个肢体不工作了会发生什么事？-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vs.18 Who arranges the parts of the body?
18节 谁来安排各肢体？------------------------------------
What do these verses tell us about how the church should operate?
这些经文告诉我们教会该怎样运转？-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In verses 21-26 the Apostle Paul develops his line of reasoning to show that a variety of body parts are necessary for the smooth functioning of the body. No one part of the body is able to perform all of the functions.
21-26节 使徒保罗继续列举肢体不同才能身体平稳工作的重要性。没有一个肢体能做整个身体的事。
What do we learn about the body parts that may seem weaker?
关于软弱肢体的经文我们学到什么？------------------
Less honorable?
不俊美的呢?-------------------------------
Why is it important that the body parts have equal concern for each other?
为什么肢体之间彼此相顾很重要？---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are some ways we show concern for each other in the church?
在教会中该怎样彼此相顾？ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write out verse 27.
写下27节-------------------------------------------------------
If we are all part of the body of Christ, what part are you? The next part of the study is to help each person find out what his/her part is. What is your spiritual gift?
若我们是基督的身体，你是哪部分？下面的学习帮助大家找出自己做哪部分肢体。你的属灵恩赐是什么？
What is meant by Spiritual Gift?
属灵恩赐的含义？
Spiritual gifts are a special ability given by the Holy Spirit to every believer, according to God’s grace, to be used for carrying out the ministry of the Church. Every believer in Christ has at least one spiritual gift. God does not give gifts because people deserve them, but because of God love. The gifts are to be used for the growth and health of the Church
属灵恩赐是圣灵给每个信徒的特殊能力，按照上帝的恩典，在教会事工中使用。每一个基督徒至少有一样属灵恩赐。上帝给人恩赐不是因为人应得，而是因着神的爱。这些恩赐使用在教会成长和教会康健上。
Part 2: What Are Your Gifts?
第2部分：你的恩赐是什么？
The church is the body of Christ. All believers are part of the body. But what part are you? How do we carry out our ministry? The Holy Spirit gives to every believer spiritual gifts that are to be used to build up the church. Every believer has a purpose, there are no insignificant people.
教会是基督的身体。所有的信徒都是肢体。你是哪部分?你是如何事工的？圣灵给每个信徒属灵恩赐用来建造教会。每个信徒都有用，没有无关紧要的人。
Spiritual gifts are mentioned in four places in the New Testament: 1 Corinthians 12:1-31; Romans 12:3-16; Ephesians 4:1-13; and 1 Peter 4:7-11.
属灵恩赐在新约中四处被提及：林前12：1-31；罗12：3-16；弗4：1-13；彼前4：7-11。
1 Corinthians 12:1, 4-11林前2：1，4-11
1Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant… 4There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. 6There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.7Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. 8To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, 9to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, 10to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. 11All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.
1 弟兄们，论到属灵的恩赐，我不愿意你们不明白···4 恩赐原有分别，圣灵却是一位。 5 职事也有分别，主却是一位。 6 功用也有分别，　神却是一位，在众人里面运行一切的事。7 圣灵显在各人身上，是叫人得益处。 8 这人蒙圣灵赐他智慧的言语；那人也蒙这位圣灵赐他知识的言语； 9 又有一人蒙这位圣灵赐他信心；还有一人蒙这位圣灵赐他医病的恩赐； 10 又叫一人能行异能，又叫一人能作先知，又叫一人能辨别诸灵，又叫一人能说方言，又叫一人能翻方言。 11 这一切都是这位圣灵所运行，随己意分给各人的。

5)-------------------------6)-------------7)---------------------------8)------------------------------- 9)------------------------------------
Vs.11 Who determines and gives gifts to the members of the church?
11节 谁来决定和赐给教会信徒恩赐？---------------
Spiritual gifts are not talents. Talents are natural abilities which God gives to both believers and unbelievers. Spiritual gifts are part of the Christian living and are given by God only to believers. Talents can be used for many purposes while spiritual gifts are given for the specific purpose of building up the church.
属灵恩赐不是天资。天资是上帝给信徒非信徒的天然能力。属灵恩赐属于基督徒生活，上帝单单给信徒的。天资可以处于很多目的使用，而属灵恩赐是专用来 建造教会的特殊目的。
Name some talents.
列举一些天资。 ------------------------------------------------------
Verses 28-31 provide us with our second list of spiritual gifts.
28-31节提出第二项属灵恩赐。
1 Corinthians 12:28-31林前12：28-31
28And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. 29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? 31But eagerly desire the greater gifts.
28 　神在教会所设立的；第一是使徒；第二是先知；第三是教师；其次是行异能的；再次是得恩赐医病的；帮助人的；治理事的；说方言的。 29 岂都是使徒吗？岂都是先知吗？岂都是教师吗？岂都是行异能的吗？ 30 岂都是得恩赐医病的吗？岂都是说方言的吗？岂都是翻方言的吗？ 31 你们要切切地求那更大的恩赐。我现今把最妙的道指示你们。

Romans 12:3-16
Paul is writing to the Christians who were living in Rome. In this section Paul is speaking about living the new life that is ours through faith. Paul discusses the subject of spiritual gifts as a result of being justified by grace through faith.
罗12：3-16
3For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you. 4Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 6We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith. 7If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; 8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
3 我凭着所赐我的恩对你们各人说：不要看自己过于所当看的；要照着　神所分给各人信心的大小，看得合乎中道。 4 正如我们一个身子上有好些肢体，肢体也不都是一样的用处。 5 我们这许多人，在基督里成为一身，互相联络作肢体，也是如此。 6 按我们所得的恩赐，各有不同。或说预言，就当照着信心的程度说预言； 7 或作执事，就当专一执事；或作教导的，就当专一教导； 8 或作劝化的，就当专一劝化；施舍的，就当诚实；治理的，就当殷勤；怜悯人的，就当甘心。

An important ingredient in using spiritual gifts in the church is the attitude with which you use the gifts.
在教会中用属灵恩赐的一个重要因素是在使用属灵恩赐时的态度。
Love 爱
 9Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.14Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 16Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.
9 爱人不可虚假：恶要厌恶，善要亲近。 10 爱弟兄，要彼此亲热；恭敬人，要彼此推让。 11 殷勤不可懒惰。要心里火热，常常服事主。 12 在指望中要喜乐，在患难中要忍耐，祷告要恒切。 13 圣徒缺乏要帮补，客要一味地款待。14 逼迫你们的，要给他们祝福；只要祝福，不可咒诅。 15 与喜乐的人要同乐；与哀哭的人要同哭。 16 要彼此同心，不要志气高大，倒要俯就卑微的人(“人”或作“事”)。不要自以为聪明。

Ephesians 4:1-13弗4：1-13
Paul is writing to the Christians who lived in Ephesus. The section on spiritual gifts comes from the section on what membership in the church involves.
保罗写信给住在以弗所的基督徒。这部分的属灵恩典讲了在教会中彼此联络的关系。
1As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 2Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 3Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 4There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called— 5one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
1 我为主被囚的劝你们：既然蒙召，行事为人就当与蒙召的恩相称。 2 凡事谦虚、温柔、忍耐，用爱心互相宽容， 3 用和平彼此联络，竭力保守圣灵所赐合而为一的心。 4 身体只有一个，圣灵只有一个，正如你们蒙召，同有一个指望。 5 一主，一信，一洗， 6 一　神，就是众人的父，超乎众人之上，贯乎众人之中，也住在众人之内。

7But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. 8This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men." 9(What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? 10He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) 11It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, 12to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
7 我们各人蒙恩，都是照基督所量给各人的恩赐。 8 所以经上说：“他升上高天的时候，掳掠了仇敌，将各样的恩赐赏给人。” 9 (既说升上，岂不是先降在地下吗？ 10 那降下的，就是远升诸天之上要充满万有的。) 11 他所赐的，有使徒，有先知，有传福音的，有牧师和教师； 12 为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体， 13 直等到我们众人在真道上同归于一，认识　神的儿子，得以长大成人，满有基督长成的身量；

The Christians Peter addressed are undergoing some form of persecution. Peter writes to them to provide encouragement and to describe what the Christians life is all about.
彼得致信的基督徒正在忍受迫害。彼得写信鼓励他们，并描述基督徒生命的样子。
7The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray. 8Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 9Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. 10Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. 11If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
7 万物的结局近了。所以你们要谨慎自守，警醒祷告。 8 最要紧的，是彼此切实相爱；因为爱能遮掩许多的罪。 9 你们要互相款待，不发怨言。 10 各人要照所得的恩赐彼此服事，作　神百般恩赐的好管家。 11 若有讲道的，要按着　神的圣言讲；若有服事人的，要按着　神所赐的力量服事，叫　神在凡事上因耶稣基督得荣耀。原来荣耀、权能都是他的，直到永永远远。阿们。
