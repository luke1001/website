Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus Christ, You have served us with a love that knows no limits. Your service has brought us eternal joy and salvation. As Your grateful steward-disciples, we pray that You empower us to be faithful, loving servants of others. Make us sensitive to their needs. Make us determined to act for their benefit. Make us faithful to demonstrate Christ-like love to others through all the days of our life. We ask this on the basis of Your loving, saving service to us. Amen.

#### I. Our Lord Calls Us To Love Other People  我们的主呼召我们去爱别人

##### A. Our Lord calls us to love all people, even our enemies, as He has loved us. 我们的主呼召我们去爱所有人，甚至我们的敌人，就像他爱我们一样。

Romans 5:6-8 - You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possible dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

罗马书5:6-8 ----6因我们还软弱的时候，基督就按所定的日期为罪人。7为义人死，是少有的；为仁人死，或者有敢作的；8惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，神的爱就在此向我们显明了。

1. Our Lord Jesus has shown us a love that is beyond all deserving. He has suffered and died to cancel out the sin of defiant, despising rebels who have often betrayed His divine love. To a sinful world that says: "I could not care less about You, God," our Lord Jesus says: "I could not care more about you."

    我们的主耶稣所显给我们的爱是我们都不配得的。他经历了受难和受死来除去那些轻视他、抵挡他的悖逆者的罪。他们却常常背叛他圣洁的爱。这罪恶的世界宣称：“神啊，我一点儿也不在乎你”，我们的主耶稣说：“我只在乎你”。

    John 15:12-13 - My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.

    约翰福音15:12-13 - 12你们要彼此相爱，像我爱你们一样，这就是我的命令。13人为朋友舍命，人的爱心没有比这个大的。

2. Our Lord commands us to love others as He has loved us - unconditionally, sacrificially, completely.

    我们的主命令我们像他爱我们一样无条件地、牺牲地、彻底地去爱其他人。

    1 John 4:10-11 - This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.

    约翰一书4:10-11 - 10不是我们爱神，乃是神爱我们，差他的儿子，为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。11亲爱的弟兄啊，神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。

3. Our Lord's sacrificial, rescuing love for us is the compelling reason for us to love others.

    我们主对我们牺牲的 、拯救的爱是我们去爱他人的强有力的理由。

4. "My God, without any merit on my part, out of His pure and free mercy, has given to me, an unworthy, condemned and contemptible creature, all the riches of justification and salvation in Christ. I am no longer in want of anything, except faith that this is so. Having such a Father, who has overwhelmed me with these inestimable riches of His, why should I not freely, with my whole heart and from voluntary zeal, do for Him all that I know will be pleasing to Him and acceptable in His sight? I will therefore give myself, as a sort of Christ, to my neighbor, even as Christ has given Himself to me; I will do nothing in this life except that what I see will be needful, advantageous, and wholesome for my neighbor, since by faith I abound in all things in Christ! (Martin Luther)

    “就我个人而言，我没有任何功德，然而，出于他纯全、无偿的怜悯，我的神将所有在基督里丰富的称义和救赎，赐给我这样一个不配、有罪、可鄙的造物。除了这样的信心以外，我已经不再渴望任何事。拥有如此一位天父，用他不可估量的丰富环绕我，我怎能不该白白的、全心全意地、热情自发地为他做那些，我知道会使他喜悦，在他眼中蒙悦纳的事呢？因此，我将我自己像基督一样向邻舍舍弃自己，就像基督为我舍弃了自己一样；此生中我只会做那些在我看来对我的邻舍是必要的、有益的、完全的事，因为藉着信心，我在基督里凡事富足。（马丁·路德）

    Matthew 5:43-45a - You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy." But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.

    马太福音5:43-45a - 43 “你们听见有话说：‘当爱你的邻舍，恨你的仇敌。'44只是我告诉你们：要爱你们的仇敌，为那逼迫你们的祷告。45这样，就可以作你们天父的儿子。”

5. "To love our enemies is not easy, but it is Christian, and nothing less is."

    “爱我们的仇敌并不容易，但是基督教义无外乎此了(但基督教的道理完全就是这样的啊)。”

##### B. Loving other people is an inescapable obligation for Christ's steward-disciples. 对基督的管家-门徒来说，爱其他人是不可逃避的责任。

Romans 13:8-10 - Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law. The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in those one rule: "Love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no harm to the neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.

罗马书13:8-10----8凡事都不可亏欠人，惟有彼此相爱，要常以为亏欠，因为爱人的就完全了律法。9像那“不可奸淫”，“不可杀人”，“不可偷盗”，“不可贪婪”，或有别的诫命，都包在“爱人如己”这一句话之内了。10爱是不加害与人的，所以爱就完全了律法。

1. It does not matter how much money we may have, we all have a special debt we owe. It is the debt of love that God directs us to pay to others every day of our life.

    我们有多少钱并不重要，我们都背负着一个特别的债务。这就是上帝指引我们在每天的生活中要偿还给别人的爱的债了。

    1 John 4:19-21 - We love because He (God) first loved us. If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. And He has given us this command: "Whoever loves God must also love his brother."

    约翰一书4:19-21 - 19我们爱，因为神先爱我们。20人若说：“我爱神”，却恨他的弟兄，就是说谎话的；不爱他所看见的弟兄，就不能爱没有看见的神。21爱神的，也当爱弟兄，这是我们从神所受的命令。

2. Our Lord inseparably joins the command to love Him with the command to love all people.

    我们的主将爱他的命令和爱所有人的命令不可分割地连在一起。

3. "The person who loves God cannot hate people. Nor can the person who hates God love people." (John Chrysostom)

    “爱神的人不会恨人。恨神的人也不会爱人。”（约翰 克里索斯托 ）

    John 13:34-35 - A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. All people will know that you are My disciples if you love one another.

    约翰福音13:34-35 - 34我给你们一条新命令，就是要你们彼此相爱；我怎样爱你们，你们也要怎样彼此相爱 。35如果你们彼此相爱，众人就会认出你们是我的门徒了。

4. Love for others is an identifying mark of a Christian steward-disciple. A living union with Jesus Christ shows itself in love for others. True faith expresses itself through love.

    爱人是基督徒管家-门徒的一个标志。与耶稣基督连结的生活在爱他人中显明出来。真的信仰通过爱表现出来。

##### C. Our Lord helps us understand the true nature of love. 我们的主帮助我们理解爱的本性。

1 Corinthians 13:4-7 - Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

哥林多前书13:4-7----4爱是恒久忍耐，又有恩慈。爱是不嫉妒，爱是不自夸、不张狂；5不作害羞的事，不求自己的益处，不轻易发怒，不计算人的恶，6不喜欢不义，只喜欢真理；7凡事包容，凡事相信，凡事盼望，凡事忍耐。

1. At its heart, Christian love is firmly devoted to seeking what is best for other people.

    基督之爱的核心是致力于寻求对他人的好处。

2. Some of the characteristics of Christian love are:

    基督之爱的一些特点是：

    a. Sacrificial

    a. 牺牲的

    b. Averse to evil or revenge

    b. 反对邪恶和复仇

    c. Delights in doing good

    c. 喜欢做好事

    d. Forgiving

    d. 宽恕

    e. Selfless

    e. 无私的

    f. Protecting

    f. 保护的

    g. Loyal

    g. 忠诚的

    Romans 15:2 - Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.

    罗马书15：2 我们各人务要叫邻舍喜悦，好让他得到益处、得到造就。

3. "Christianity is more than a belief or creed that saves one for the next world; it is a way of living. It is a life of love and service. The Christian is one who devotes his powers, abilities, and money to help others." (D. C. Cook)

    “基督教教义比为来世得拯救的信仰或信条含义要广。它是指一种生活方式。它是一种爱和服侍的生活。基督徒是一个奉献自己的力量、能力和金钱去帮助他人的人。”（D. C. 库克）

4. It is the nature of love "to quietly accept the challenge of completing the other person."

    爱的本性是“悄悄地接受造就他人的挑战。”

    Philippians 2:4-8 - Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus; who being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death - even death on a cross!

    腓立比书2:4-8----4各人不要单顾自己的事，也要顾别人的事。5你们应当有这样的意念，这也是基督的意念。6他本来有神的形象，却不坚持自己与神平等的地位，7反而倒空自己，取了奴仆的形象，成为人的样式；8既然有人的样子，就自甘卑微，顺服至死，而且死在十字架上。

5. Love looks out for the interests of others. Love willingly sacrifices one's own advantage for the good of the neighbor.

    爱看顾他人的利益。爱会自愿地为了邻舍的益处牺牲自己的好处。

6. Christ's humble servant love for us is both our model and our motivation for loving others.

    耶稣对我们谦卑的、服侍的爱不仅是我们的楷模，也是我们爱他人的动机。

7. Love which expresses itself in active, self-giving service to others is powerful. Stanley Mooneyham, a former director of World Vision, once said: "Love merely talked about is easily turned aside. Love demonstrated is almost irresistible."

    在行动中表现出的、对他人无私的爱是强大的。世界宣明会的前领导者史丹利·蒙利咸曾经说过：“只是说出来的爱容易转离。行出来的爱几乎是不可抵抗的。”

##### II. Our Lord Gives Us Certain Roles In Life That Put Us In Relationships With People Whom We Are To Love And Serve 主在生活中为我们设定了特定的角色，把我们放入到那些我们要去爱和服侍的人的关系中

These roles and relationships are part of our Christian calling. They help determine our responsibilities to care for and serve specific people.

这些角色和关系是我们基督徒呼召的一部分。在我们关心和服侍不同的人的时候，这些角色和关系能帮助我们确定相应的职责是什么。

##### A. Husbands 丈夫

In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.

以弗所书5:25-28a----25你们作丈夫的，要爱你们的妻子，正如基督爱教会，为教会舍己。26要用水藉着道把教会洗净，成为圣洁，27可以献给自己，作个荣耀的教会，毫无玷污，皱纹等类的病，乃是圣洁没有瑕疵的。28丈夫也当照样爱妻子，如同爱自己的身子。

以弗所书5:22-24----22你们作妻子的，当顺服自己的丈夫，如同顺服主。23因为丈夫是妻子的头，如同基督是教会的头，他又是教会全体的救主。24教会怎样顺服基督，妻子也要怎样凡事顺服丈夫。

父母通过用神的话语和旨意引导、指引的方式服侍他们的孩子。

##### D. Children 孩子

Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.

以弗所书6:5-8----5你们作仆人的，要惧怕战兢，用诚实的心听从你们肉身的主人，好像听从基督一般。6不要只在眼前侍奉，像是讨人喜欢的，要像基督的仆人，从心里遵行神的旨意，7甘心侍奉，好像服侍主，不像服侍人。8因为晓得各人所行的善事，不论是为奴的、是自主的，都必按所行的，得主的赏赐。

Titus 2:9-10 - Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.

提多书2:9-10 - 9劝仆人要顺服自己的主人，凡事讨他的喜欢，不可顶撞他，10不可私拿东西，要显为忠诚，以至凡事尊荣我们救主神的道。

彼得前书5:2-3----2务要牧养在你们中间神的群羊，按着神旨意照管他们；不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心；也不是因为贪财，乃是出于乐意；3也不是辖制所托付你们的，乃是作群羊的榜样。

Titus 1:9 - (An elder) must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.

提多书1:9 （长老）坚守所教真实的道理，就能将纯正的教训劝化人，又能把争辩的人驳倒了。

Church leaders are to serve members of the church by instructing them in sound teaching, by serving as wholesome examples to them, by watching over them and by caring for their spiritual welfare.

教会领袖通过用纯正的教导指导教会成员，以完全的榜样作侍奉，照管他们、关心他们的灵性健康来服侍教会成员。

##### H. Church Members 教会成员

Hebrews 13:7, 17 - Remember your leaders, who spoke the Word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith . . . Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you.

希伯来书 13:7,17 - 7从前引导你们、传神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。17你们要依从那些引导你们的，且要顺服，因他们为你们的灵魂时刻警醒，好像那将来交账的人。你们要使他们交的时候有快乐，不至忧愁；若忧愁就与你们无益了。

1. Church members are to serve their spiritual leaders by imitating their godly example and by respecting their authority and cooperating with them.

    教会成员通过效法属灵领袖的虔诚榜样并尊重他们的权柄、配合他们的工作来服侍他们。

    Hebrews 10:24-25 - And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

    希伯来书10:24-25 - 24又要彼此相顾，激发爱心，勉励行善。25你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道那日子临近，就更当如此。

2. Church members are to serve fellow members by encouraging them in their faith and discipleship.

    教会成员通过在信心和门徒的身份中彼此鼓励来彼此服侍。

    Romans 14:1, 13, 15-16, 19-21; 15:1 - Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters. Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.

    罗马书14:1,13,15-16,19-21

    1信心软弱的，你们要接纳，但不要辩论所疑惑的事。

    13所以我们不可再彼此论断，宁可定意，谁也不给弟兄放下绊脚跌人之物。

    15你若因食物叫弟兄忧愁，就不是按着爱人的道理行。基督已经替他死，你不可因你的食物叫他败坏。16不可叫你的善被人毁谤。

    19所以，我们务要追求和睦的事与彼此建立德行的事。20不可因食物毁坏神的工程。凡物固然洁净，但有人因食物叫人跌倒，就是他的罪了。21无论是吃肉，是喝酒，是什么别的事，叫弟兄跌倒，一概不做才好。

    罗马书15:1 我们坚固的人应该担代不坚固人的软弱，不求自己的喜悦。

3. Church members are to serve fellow members by using their Christian freedom in ways that will benefit them and not influence them to fall into sin and/or unbelief.

    教会成员通过一些能使彼此得益处而不会影响他人犯罪和/或不信的方式，使用他们在基督里的自由来彼此服侍。

##### I. Citizens 公民

1 Peter 2:13-14 - Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

彼得前书2:13-14----13你们为主的缘故，要顺服人的一切制度，或是在上的君王，14或是君王所派罚恶赏善的臣宰。

Romans 13:1a, 7 - Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. . . Give everyone what you owe him: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

罗马书13:1a，7 - 1在上有权柄的，人人当顺服他，因为没有权柄不是出于神的，…… 7凡人所当得的，就给他；当得粮的，给他纳粮；当得税的，给他上税；当惧怕的，惧怕他；当恭敬的，恭敬他。

Citizens are to serve their government by submitting to the authority of their government.

Galatians 6:2 - Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

加拉太书6:2 你们各人的重担要互相担当，如此 ，就完全了基督的律法。

1. "To pity distress is human; to relieve it is God-like." (Horace Mann)

    “对苦难表同情显示出人性；若能解除苦难就是像神一样了 。”（霍勒斯·曼）

2. Our Lord calls us to give others more than our pity when they have difficulties. He calls on us to give them our help.

    我们的主呼召我们在他人有困难的时候我们要付出比同情更多的东西。他呼召我们给予他人帮助。

##### B. Our Lord calls us to meet the physical needs of others. 我们的主呼召我们满足他人的物质需要。

James 2:15-16 - Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?

雅各书2:15-16----15若是弟兄或是姐妹，赤身露体，又缺了日用的饮食，16你们中间有人对他们说：“平平安安地去吧！愿你们穿得暖吃得饱”，却不给他们身体所需用的，这有什么益处呢？

1 John 3:16-18 - This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.

约翰一书3:16-18 ----16主为我们舍命，我们从此就知道何为爱，我们也当为弟兄舍命。17凡有世上财物的，看见弟兄穷乏，却塞住怜恤的心，爱神的心怎能存在他里面呢？18小子们哪，我们相爱，不要只在言语和舌头上，总要在行为和诚实上。

1. God wants us to give of the material resources He has given us to meet the genuine physical needs of others.

    上帝想要我们把他赐予我们的物质财富用来满足他人的真实物质需要。

2. "Because You have given much, I too shall give; Out of your great blessings, Lord, each day I live - To every person that I see Who has the need of help from me." (Grace Crowell)

    “因为你赐下众多，我也将给予；主啊，出于你的伟大祝福，每一天我都为那些我见到的需要我帮助的人而活。”（格蕾丝·克罗瓦尔）

3. "You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving."

    “你可以给而不爱，但你不能爱而不给。”

##### C. Our Lord calls us to meet the spiritual needs of others. 我们的主呼召我们满足他人的灵性需求

Matthew 9:36-38 - When He (Jesus) saw the crowds, He had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest field."

马太福音9：36-38----36他看见许多的人，就怜悯他们，因为他们困苦流离，如同羊没有牧人一般。37于是对门徒说：“要收的庄稼多，做工的人少。38所以，你们当求庄稼的主，打发工人出去收他的庄稼。”

Matthew 28:19-20a - Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

马太福音28：9-20a----19所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。20凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守。

1. Christ says to every lost sinner: "Come!" and to every converted sinner: "Go!"

    基督对每个迷失的罪人说：“来吧！”并对每个悔改的罪人说：“去吧！”

2. The day has now come when a Christian who is not praying and working to share the Gospel to make disciples must first explain and then apologize for this omission. God's call to believers today is not to let their Christianity end in what it does for them, but to let it begin by doing something for God and for others. God gives the church the serious work of proclaiming the Gospel to all nations. This is the highest expression of Christian service in the world.

    这日子已经来到，就是当一个基督徒没有祷告，也没有做工分享福音使人作门徒的时候，他必须首先做出解释，然后为这样的疏忽道歉。今天上帝呼召基督徒，不是让他们的基督精神在他们所得的事上结束，而是让基督精神从为神和为人做事开始。上帝赐给教会严肃的工作，就是向万国传扬福音。这是世界上基督徒事工的最高表现。

##### D. Our Lord calls us to show love in many ways. 我们的主呼召我们用多种方式表现爱。

Romans 12:13-21 - Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge: I will repay," says the Lord. On the contrary: "If you enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this you will heap burning coals on his head." Do not be overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.

罗马书12:13-21----13圣徒缺乏要帮补，客要一味地款待。14逼迫你们的，要给他们祝福；只要祝福，不可咒诅。15与喜乐的人要同乐；与哀哭的人要同哭。16要彼此同心，不要志气高大，倒要俯就卑微的人。不要自以为聪明。17不要以恶报恶。众人以为美的事，要留心去做。18若是能行，总要尽力与众人和睦。19亲爱的弟兄，不要自己伸冤，宁可让步 。听凭主怒。因为经上记着：“主说 ：伸冤在我，我必报应。”20所以，“你的仇敌若饿了，就给他吃；若渴了，就给他喝。因为你这样行，就是把炭火堆在他的头上。”21你不可为恶所胜，反要以善胜恶。

1. "What does love look like? It has the hands to help others. It has the feet to hurry to the poor and needy. It has eyes to see misery and want. It has the ears to hear the cries and sorrows of others. That is what love looks like" (Saint Augustine)

    “爱是什么样子？它有手去帮助他人。它有脚快速行到贫穷和需要的人那里。它有眼看到悲惨和渴想。它有耳能听到他人的哀哭和悲声。那就是爱的样子。”（圣奥古斯丁）

2. "Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, to all the people you can, as long as you possibly can." (John Wesley)

    “做一切能做的善，行一切能行的路，见一切能见的人，要尽你所能。”（约翰 ·卫斯理）

##### E. Our Lord calls us to be tireless in doing good for others. 我们的主呼召我们在为他人行善的时候不丧志

2 Thessalonians 3:13 - And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.

帖撒罗尼迦后书3:13 弟兄们，你们行善不可丧志。

Galatians 6:9-10 - Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

加拉太书6:9-10----9我们行善，不可丧志；若不灰心，到了时候就要收成。10所以，有了机会，就当向众人行善，，向信徒一家的人更当这样。

1. "I expect to pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now; let me not defer or neglect it - for I shall not pass this way again."

    “我期望仅仅经过这世界一次；因此让我现在就做我所能做的一切善事，或者展现我能向任何同伴展示的善意；让我不要延期或忽视它，因为我不会再次经过这条路。”

2. "When are we permitted to stop giving to others and serving them? We may stop when our Lord stops giving to and serving us."

    “我们什么时候允许停止给予他人或服侍他们？只有当我们的主停止给予和服侍我们的时候。”

3. "Lord, always be the Master of our lives so that we may always be the servants of others."

    “主啊，请永远做我们生活的主，如此我们就能永远做他人的仆人了。”

#### IV. Our Lord Calls Us To A Lifetime Of Faithful Discipleship 我们的主呼召我们一生都作忠心的门徒

Revelation 2:10b - Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.

启示录2:10b 你务要至死忠心，我就赐给你那生命的冠冕。

##### A. Our Lord calls His steward-disciples to be faithful to Him their whole life long. 我们的主呼召他的管家-门徒一生都对他忠心。

Philippians 1:6 - Being confident of this, that He (God) who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

腓立比书1:6 我深信那在你们心里动了善工的，必成全这工，直到耶稣基督的日子。

Isaiah 41:9b-10 - I said, "You are My servant"; I have chosen you and have not rejected you. So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

以赛亚书41:9b-10----9且对你说：你是我的仆人，我拣选你，并不弃绝你。10你不要害怕，因为我与你同在；不要惊惶，因为我是你的神。我必坚固你，我必帮助你，我必用我公义的右手扶持你。

##### B. Our Lord promises to be with us and to strengthen us so that we may serve Him as stewards and disciples for all our lives. 我们的主承诺与我们同在并坚固我们，如此我们可以一生都作为管家和仆人服侍他。

##### C. Let us respond to this call and promise by dedicating ourselves completely to the service of our Savior and Lord. 让我们通过将自己完全献上服侍我们的救主来回应这样的呼召。

• "Lord Jesus, I belong to You from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. I am sure that I will always be Yours because You have redeemed me. You are the King of my life and have complete, undisputed ownership of all my affections, will and desires. My chief aim in life shall be to please You. So continue to change me and cleanse me and use me as You wish. Keep me loyal to this intention for Your precious Name's sake. Amen."

• “主耶稣，我从头顶到脚底都属于你。我确信我一直属你因为你救赎了我。你是我生命之王，你对我所有的感情、愿望和欲望都有完全的、无可争辩的所有权。我生命的首要目的应当是得你喜悦。因此，请继续改变我，洗净我，按你所愿来使用我。我奉你宝贵的名祈求你使我忠于此愿。阿门。”
