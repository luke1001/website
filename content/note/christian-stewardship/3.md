#### I. What God Teaches Us About Time And Life 神教导了我们哪些关于时间和生命的真理

##### A. The two main words for "time" in the New Testament are the words χρόνος (chronos) and καιρὸς (kairos). χρόνος (chronos) emphasizes that time is a measured period during which something exits and highlights the quantity or the amount of time. καιρὸς (kairos) emphasizes that time is a period of opportunity in which things must or can occur and highlights the quality or the possible uses and benefits of time. 在新约圣经中两个主要表示时间的词是χρόνος (chronos) 和 καιρὸς (kairos)。χρόνος (chronos)着重于事物所存在的一段可衡量的时期，强调时间的数量或数目。καιρὸς (kairos)着重于事物发生的一个时机，强调时间质量或者说对时间的利用或果效。

John 9:4 - As long as it is day, we must do the work of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.

约翰福音9:4 - 趁着白日，我们必须做那差我来者的工；黑夜将到，就没有人能做工了。

John 19:30 - When He had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

约翰福音9:30 - 耶稣尝了那醋，就说：「成了！」便低下头，将灵魂交付神了。

1. Our Lord Jesus Himself lived with the belief that time is a "precious, God-given period of opportunity for people to fulfill God's purposes for their lives." He faithfully carried out God's will and completed His work of earning forgiveness and salvation for all.

    我们的主耶稣自己生活的信念认为时间是“宝贵的，神所赐给人的时期或机会，用以成就神对人生命的旨意。”祂信实的成就了神的旨意，完成了祂所做的——为所有人赢得赦免和救恩的工作。

2. As Christ's steward-disciples and motivated by His self-giving love for us, we are to adopt this same view of time and strive to be faithful in accomplishing God's will for us.

    作为基督的管家-门徒并且被祂对我们无私的爱所驱使，我们选定与之相同的时间观念。并且努力要信实的成就神对我们的旨意。

Genesis 1:3-5 - 3) God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning - the first day."

创世纪1:3-5 - 3神说：「要有光」，就有了光。4神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。5神称光为「昼」，称暗为「夜」。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。

##### B. God created time as He began His work of creating all things. God is the Creator and Owner of time. 神在创造万物之始即创造了时间。神是时间的创造者和主人。

Job 10:12 - You (God) gave me life and showed me kindness, and in Your providence watched over my spirit.

约伯记10:12 - 你将生命和慈爱赐给我；你也眷顾保全我的心灵。

##### C. God gives us our life and the time it contains out of His love and concern for us. 出于祂对我们的爱和关心，神赐予了我们生命和生命中所包含的时间

Psalm 90:10 - The length of our days is seventy years - or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their span is trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.

诗篇90:10 - 我们一生的年日是七十岁，若是强壮可到八十岁；但其中所矜夸的不过是劳苦愁烦，转眼成空，我们便如飞而去。

##### D. The time of life that God gives us is limited and passes quickly. 神赐与我们生命中的时间是有限的并且会很快的消逝。

"Dawn does not come twice to wake a person." - Arabian proverb

-“清晨从不出现两次来叫醒人”- 阿拉伯谚语

"Tempus fugit" - Latin proverb that means "time flies."

-“Tempus fugit" - 拉丁箴言意为“时光飞逝。”

以赛亚书55:6-7----6当趁耶和华可寻找的时候寻找他，相近的时候求告他。7恶人当离弃自己的道路；不义的人当除掉自己的意念。归向耶和华，耶和华就必怜恤他；当归向我们的　神，因为　神必广行赦免。

1 Timothy 2:3-6a - 3) This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4) who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. 5) For there is one God and one mediator between God and people, the man Christ Jesus, 6) who gave Himself as a ransom for all people.

提摩太前书2:3-6a ----3 这是好的，在　神我们救主面前可蒙悦纳。4 他愿意万人 得救，明白真道。5 因为只有一位　神，在　神和人中间，只有一位中保，乃是降世为人的基督耶稣；6 他舍自己作万人的赎价。

##### F. The first and most essential use of time for any one is to be saved from his/her sins through faith in the ransoming, pardoning work of Jesus Christ.
对任何人来说对时间第一要紧的使用就是藉着相信耶稣基督的救赎赦免之功得以从他/她的罪中得救。

2 Corinthians 5:14-15 - 14)For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. 15) And He died for all that those who live should not longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised again.

哥林多后书5:14-15----14原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了；15并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。

1 Peter 2:9 - But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him, who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.

    我们的主希望我们能最佳的使用自己生命，将之用在有永恒意义的事上：训练基督门徒。

3. "There are just three things we can do with life: We can hoard it, squander it, or invest it. The Christian steward-disciple has settled the matter in his/her own heart and mind. He/she says: 'I want my life to count for God. While I pass through this world I want to do as much as possible for the greatest cause on earth. I am highly resolved, God helping me, to invest my time, my talents, my treasures, in the greatest cause known, the kingdom of God.'"

    “我们只有三种方式来对待生命：埋藏、挥霍或是投资。基督徒门徒-管家在他/她的心里已有定意。他/她如此说:‘我愿我的生命对神有价值。当我在这个世界活着的时候我想为这个目标尽力去做。我下定决心，求神帮助我，将我的时间，我的才能，我的财富投资在这个目标上——神的国’”

3. "A person must recognize that he/she does have the time to do all that the Lord expects. Everyone has the same amount of time - 24 hours a day. We all receive the same time pie daily; the differences among people lie in how they slice it. God's expectations for any day are reasonable. They may be hard, but they are achievable."

    “人必须认识到他/她确实有时间来做神所期盼的事。每个人都有同样的事件-一天24小时。我们每天都得到同样份数的时间；人们的不同在于他们怎样来切分。神对每天的的期许都是合理的。可能困难但都是可以做得到的”

5. Guidance for discovering God's will in specific situations from George Mueller

    乔治·慕勒的关于在特定的情形下探求上帝旨意的指导。

    a. "I seek at the beginning to get my heart into such a state that it has no will of its own in regard to a given matter. 90% of the difficulties are overcome when our hearts are ready to do God's will, whatever it may be. When one is truly in this state, it is usually just a little way to the knowledge of what His will is."

    “我在起初的时候力图使自己保持在对相关的事件上没有私心的状态。当我们的心预备好行神的旨意的时候90%的困难就已经克服了。当一个人真的在此状态下时，通常就离明白神的旨意是什么不远了。”

    b. "Having done this, I do not leave the result to my feelings or simple impressions I receive. If I would do this, I make myself vulnerable to great delusions. I seek the will of the Spirit of God through or in connection with the Word of God. The Spirit and the Word must be combined. If I look to the Spirit alone without God's Word, I make myself open to great delusions also."

    “在这样做之后，我不需要将结果依赖于我的感觉或仅仅是我的感受。如果我这样做的话，我就使自己落在自己的幻觉中了。我藉着神的话语或在神的话语之中寻求圣灵的旨意。圣灵和神的话必须相结合。如果我离开神的话去寻求圣灵，我就同样使自己容易受幻觉的影响了”

    c. "Next, I take into account providential circumstances that God has arranged. These more clearly indicate God's will in connection with His Word and Spirit."

    “接着，我考察神所安排的景况。联系到神的话语和圣灵后这些事会更清楚的显明神的旨意”

    d. "Then, I ask God in prayer to reveal His will to me correctly."

    “然后，我在祷告中求神将祂的旨意正确的显明给我”

    e. "So, through prayer, the study of the Word and reflection, I come to a deliberate decision according to the best of my ability and knowledge. If my mind is at peace and continues so after two or three more prayer requests, I proceed according to my decision. In both minor matters and in activities of the greatest significance, I have found this method always to be effective."

    “因此，藉着祷告，查考圣经和深思，我就按照我最好的能力和知识来得出一个审慎的决定。如果我的心里平安并且在两到三次祷告之后仍是这样的话，我就根据我的决定来采取行动。无论大事小事，我发现这种方法都是有效的。”

C. Strive to be both effective (doing the right things) and efficient (doing things the right way).

努力做到即有成效（做正确的事）又有功效（用最佳方式做事情）

J. Use the 80/20 rule (The Pareto Principle). "If all the items are arranged in order of value, 80% of the value would come from only 20% of the items, while the remaining 20% of the value would come from 80% of the items.

V. Work toward having and maintaining a wholesome balance to your life.

1. "Only one life, it will soon be past; Only what's done for Christ will last."

5. This is the beginning of a new day. God has given me this day to use as I will. I can waste it or grow in its light and be of service to Christ and others. What I do with this day is important because I have exchanged a day of my earthly life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever. May I not regret what I have done with it.

    这将是新一天的起始，神把这一天赐给我来自由使用。我可以浪费它或是用此时光来服事基督和他人。我如何来使用这一天的重要性在于我已经为之付出了地上生命的一天。当明天来临的时候，这一天将永远逝去。愿我不会对我如果度过今天而感到后悔。

6. Live this day as if it belongs to God. It does.

    这一天过得如同它是属于神的一样，它的确是。
