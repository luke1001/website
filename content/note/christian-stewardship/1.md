#### LIFE WITH OUR LORD 与主同活

##### Responding To The Lord's Call To Be His Steward-Disciples 回应主的呼召做他的管家-门徒

Goal: To have Jesus Christ present us with His Word-based call to a life of serving as His steward-disciples so that, moved by the power of the Holy Spirit, we respond by committing/recommitting ourselves to be faithful servants of our Lord and Savior.

目标：让耶稣基督用基于祂的话语的呼召带领我们来到一个以耶稣基督的管家-门徒的身份来毕生服事的生命面前，以致我们被圣灵的大能所感动而决心如此来回应主：委身/重新委身自己成为我们救主的忠信仆人。

Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus Christ, as we begin this Bible-based study of Christian stewardship and discipleship, we ask that You grant us Your rich blessing. Increase our understanding of Your Word and will. Strengthen our faith and our allegiance to You. Empower us to live a more devoted life of joyful obedience to You as our Lord. On the basis of Your saving name, we ask this. Amen.

祷告：亲爱的主耶稣，在我们开始学习这门基于圣经的、关于基督徒的管理职分和门徒职分的课程时，我们求你丰丰富富地赐福给我们。求你加增我们对你话语和旨意的理解。求你坚立我们的信心和对你的忠信。求你给我们能力，使我们可以更完全的摆上自己，喜乐地顺服于你做我们的救主。我们奉你救恩的名祈求。阿门。

#### I. The Lord Jesus Calls Us To A Life As His Steward-Disciples 主耶稣呼召我们要以祂的管家-门徒的身份而活

##### A. Jesus Christ Has One Major Interest: He Wants To Make People Into Christian Stewards And Disciples. 耶稣基督特别关注一件事：祂要使人成为基督徒管家和门徒

Matthew 28:19-20a - Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20) and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

马太福音28:19-20a----19 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，

1 Corinthians 4:1 - So then, men ought to regard us a servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.

哥林多前书4:1 人应当以我们为基督的执事，为　神奥秘事的管家。

1. In the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20a), Jesus expresses God's primary will that people be brought to faith in the true God and become His disciples.

    在大使命（马太福音28:19-20a）里，耶稣说明了神主要的旨意是要使人归信真神并成为祂的门徒。

2. The Greek word for disciple is μαθητης (mathetes). This word means "a person who it taught or trained, one who learns and follows."

    希腊文中门徒一词是μαθητης (mathetes). 这个词的意思是“一个受过教育或训练的人，一个学习并跟随的人”

3. In 1 Corinthians 4:1, the Apostle Paul speaks of believers as servants. In the Bible, God uses a number of Greek words that are translated as "servant." The Greek word used in this verse is the word οἰκονόμος (oikonomos). An οἰκονόμος is "a servant who is a manager or administrator who is responsible to care for the things his/her master owns and to use them faithfully according to the master's wishes."

    在哥林多前书4:1，使徒保罗说信徒当为执事（仆人）。在圣经中，神使用了许多不同的词都被翻译为“仆人”。在这节经文中的希腊文是οἰκονόμος (oikonomos)。一个οἰκονόμος是指“一个有管理职分的仆人，他的职责是负责照料他/她的主人所拥有的财产，并忠信的按照主人的意志来使用这些财产”

4. Leighton Ford offers this simple definition of a steward-disciple: "A steward-disciple is a person who is moving with and for Jesus Christ."

    傅礼敦这样简明的定义管家-门徒：“一个管家-门徒是一个与耶稣基督同行且为耶稣基督而行的人”

5. Dr. Martin Luther offers the definition of a steward-disciple as "a little Christ."

    马丁路德博士将管家-门徒定义为“小基督”。

6. A more complete definition of the steward-disciple is: "A steward-disciple is a person who enjoys the Master's love, receives the Master's pardon, accepts the Master's teaching, adopts the Master's lifestyle, joins in the Master's mission, serves the Master's wishes and awaits the Master's glory."

    对管家-门徒更全面的定义是“管家-门徒是一个享有主人的爱，得蒙主人的赦免，接受主人的教导，采取主人的生活方式，参与主人的事工，服事主人的意志并等候主人的荣耀的人”

7. Another way to think of being a Christian steward-disciple is this: "A Christian steward-disciple is a mind through which Christ thinks, a heart through which Christ loves, a voice through which Christ speaks, a hand through which Christ helps." (Guideposts magazine)

    另一种对基督徒管家-门徒的诠释是：“一个基督徒管家-门徒是一个心思想基督所想，内心爱基督所爱，表达说基督所说，双手做基督所做的人” (Guideposts magazine)

##### B. Jesus Calls People To Be His Steward-Disciples 耶稣呼召人成为祂的管家-门徒

John 15:16a - You did not choose Me, but I chose you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last.

约翰福音15:16 - 16不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们，并且分派你们去结果子，叫你们的果子常存。

1. The call to be a steward-disciple originates with Jesus Christ and not with people.

    成为管家-门徒的呼召是由耶稣基督起始而不是从人起始。

    a. In other religions and philosophies, the matter of becoming a member and follower is up to the individual person.

    在其它的宗教或思潮中，成为其中一员的关键在于个人。

    b. In Christianity, the matter of becoming a believer and steward-disciple is not something we can volunteer for or choose in our own natural power. We must be called to it by God Himself.

    在基督教中，成为一名信徒和管家-门徒并不是我们自愿来的，或是按照我们本性的能力所选择的。我们必须是被神自己所呼召。

    Ephesians 2:1-2, 12 - As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air. Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ . . . without hope and without God in the world.

    以弗所书2:1-2, 12

    1你们死在过犯罪恶之中，他叫你们活过来。2那时，你们在其中行事为人，随从今世的风俗，顺服空中掌权者的首领，就是现今在悖逆之子心中运行的邪灵。

    以弗所书2:12 那时，你们与基督无关，在以色列国民以外，在所应许 的诸约上是局外人，并且活在世上没有指望，没有　神。

2. By nature, all people are born in a condition of spiritual death, under the control of sin and Satan and separated from God and His blessings.

    按照本性，所有人出生的时候都是灵里死亡的，在罪和撒旦的权势之下并且与神和祂的祝福分离。

    Mark 1:15, 17a - "The time has come," He said, "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news! . . . "Come, follow Me," Jesus said.

    马可福音1:15- 说：「日期满了，　神的国近了。你们当悔改，信福音！」
马可福音 17a-耶稣对他们说：「来跟从我，」

    2 Thessalonians 2:13b-14 - From the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."

    帖撒罗尼迦后书2:13b-14-----13因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。14神借我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。

3. Jesus calls people to be His believing steward-disciples through the message of His Word of Law and Gospel.

    耶稣藉着祂律法和福音的信息呼召人成为他忠信的管家-门徒。

    a. Jesus' call goes out to sinners, those who are living in rebellion against God and are undeserving of His mercy.

    耶稣的呼召临到罪人，就是在生活抵挡神并且不配得祂的怜悯的人。

    b. Through the Law, God calls sinners to recognize their sin and sincerely regret it, to dread the punishing consequences of their sin and seek God's mercy.

    藉着律法，神呼召罪人认识到他们的罪并且真诚的悔罪，惧怕对他们的罪行所应得的惩罚并且寻求神的怜悯。

    c. Through the Gospel, God calls sinners to believe in His undeserved love for them in Jesus, to receive His forgiveness for their sins and to rejoice in His promise of future glory.

    藉着福音，神呼召罪人相信在耶稣里向他们所有的爱，这本是他们所不配得的。祂对他们的罪的赦免以及欢喜祂所应许的将来的荣耀。

    1 Corinthians 12:3b - No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.

    哥林多前书12:3b - 若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说「耶稣是主」的。

    Philippians 2:13 - For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.

    腓立比书2:13 - 因为你们立志行事都是　神在你们心里运行，为要成就他的美意。

4. God enables people to accept the call to believing steward-discipleship through the faith-creating work of the Holy Spirit. Becoming a steward-disciple is all God's doing.

    神使人接受成为管家-信徒的呼召是藉着圣灵做工使人产生信心。成为一个管家-信徒完全是神的工作。

##### C. The Call To Steward-Discipleship Involves A Two-Way Promise 成为管家信徒的呼召包含两方面的应许

2 Corinthians 8:9 - For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.

哥林多后书 8:9 - 你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典：他本来富足，却为你们成了 贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。

Romans 8:32 - He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all - how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?

罗马书8:32 - 神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？

1. Jesus promises to give us all that He has (provision for our needs, protection, forgiveness, eternal life, guidance, strength, and many other things) to us.

    耶稣应许要赐给我们一切祂为我们所预备的（预备我们所需，保守我们，赦免我们，永生，指引，力量和许多其它的事）

    a. We possess all these things now, although at present, we do not enjoy their full use.

    我们现在已经拥有这些，仅管现今我们还不能完全的享用这些。

    b. God wisely dispenses His blessings in our lives the way a caring, skillful trustee would administer a trust fund for the good of a child. Our God acts, not to harm, but to enhance our lives.

    神满有智慧的在我们的生命里分配祂的赐福，正如一个善于照料，娴熟的托管员将会治理一笔可靠的基金好使孩子得益处。我们的神的作为，不会带来伤害而是对我们的生命有益
    
    • The Rest Of The Steward-Disciple Story
    
    • 其余关于管家-门徒的故事

    Luke 14:33 - In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple.

    路加福音 14:33 - 这样，你们无论什么人，若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的门徒。

    2 Corinthians 5:14-15 - For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died, and He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them and was raised again.

    哥林多后书 5:14-15----14 原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了；15 并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。

2. In loving, thankful response to Jesus Christ, we promise to give all we have (love, loyalty, life, resources, service) to Him.

    若向耶稣基督存有爱、感恩的回应，我们将应许把自己一切所有的（爱、忠诚、生命、财产、服事）都献给祂。

    a. Jesus asks of us all that we are and all that we have, not just part of it.

    耶稣要求我们的全人和我们所全部拥有的，而不是其中的一部份。

    b. Our reason for completely dedicating our whole self and all we have is compelling: "Shall I grudge to spend my life for Him who did not grudge to shed His life-blood for me?" (Beveridge)

    我们完全奉献自己和我们所拥有的一切之缘由是令人信服的：“祂毫不吝惜自己 的生命为我流血，我怎能吝惜自己的生命不献给祂，”(Beveridge)

    c. Consider the poor African Christian woman who sold herself into slavery for money so that she would have something to give to her Savior and her church. She explained: "I wanted to give Jesus an offering that would satisfy my heart."

    留意这个贫穷的非洲基督徒妇女所说的话，她把自己卖为奴隶好得钱来可以奉献 给救主和教会。她如此说：“我想给耶稣的奉献是能足够满足我的心愿的”

##### D. The Path Of Steward-Discipleship Is One Of Enduring Earthly Hardships Until We Enjoy Eternal Glory 管家-门徒之路是要忍受地上的艰难直到我们可以得享永生的荣耀。

Acts 14:22b - We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.
    
使徒行传 14:22b - 我们进入神的国，必须经历许多艰难。

2 Timothy 4:18a - The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom.

提摩太后书4:18a - 主必救我脱离诸般的凶恶，也必救我进他的天国。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿们。

1. Steward-disciples of Jesus will walk a similar life path to that of their Lord, a path of earthly difficulties that ends in heavenly delights.

    耶稣的管家-门徒将会像主一样行完一生，这是经历在地上的艰难却以属天的喜乐结束的道路。

2. The steward-disciple sings with Thomas Shepherd:

    The consecrated cross I'll bear

    Till death shall set me free,

    And then go home, my crown to wear,

    For there's a crown for me.

    管家-门徒会与Thomas Shepherd 一同歌唱：

    神圣十架将背负

    至死之时获自由，

    且回天家佩冠冕，

    因有冠冕为我留。

##### E. The Worth Of Having The Lord And His Blessings Surpasses All Else And Makes All The Costs Of Having Them Insignificant 得以得到主和祂的祝福超越了一切并且让所有为之付上的代价都微不足道了。

Matthew 13:44-46 - 44) The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. 45) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 46) When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

马太福音 13:44-46----44「天国好像宝贝藏在地里，人遇见了就把它藏起来， 欢欢喜喜地去变卖一切所有的，买这块地。45天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子，46 遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。

1. The twin parables (The Hidden Treasure and The Precious Pearl) point out the supreme value of having Jesus Christ and a place in His kingdom. Having Jesus and His kingdom blessings is worth giving up all things in order to possess.

    这一对比喻（埋藏的宝贝和重价的珠子）指出得到耶稣基督和得以在祂的国度中是极为宝贵的。得到耶稣基督和祂国度的祝福值得我们付上所有来获得。

2. "When a person becomes a Christian, he/she takes up infinitely more than he/she gives up."

    “当一个人成为基督徒后，他/她所接受的比他/她所付上的更多”

#### II. The Lord Jesus Desires A Response Of Trust And Obedience To His Gracious Call 主耶稣希望人对祂恩典的呼召有信靠和顺服的回应

##### A. Jesus Desires A Positive Response To His Call To Steward-Discipleship 耶稣希望人对代管家-门徒的呼召有积极的回应。

Matthew 4:18-22 - As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. "Come, follow Me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men." At once they left their nets and followed Him. Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father, Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Him

马太福音4:18-22----18耶稣在加利利海边行走，看见弟兄二人，就是那称呼彼得 的西门和他兄弟安得烈，在海里撒网；他们本是打鱼的。19耶稣对他们说：「来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。」20他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。21从那里往前走，又看见弟兄二人，就是西庇太的儿子雅各和他兄弟约翰，同他们的父亲西庇太在船上补网，耶稣就招呼他们，22他们立刻舍了船，别了父亲，跟从了耶稣。

1. The first disciples responded positively to the Lord's call.

    最初的门徒积极的回应主的呼召。

2. In His remarks to three potential steward-disciples, Jesus teaches important lessons about the call He issues and the response He seeks:

    在主耶稣对三个可能成为管家门徒的评论中，耶稣教导了关于祂的呼召和祂所要的回应的重要教训。

    Luke 9:57-58 - As they were walking along the road, a man said to Him, "I will follow you wherever you go." Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head."

    路加福音 9:57-58----57他们走路的时候，有一人对耶稣说：「你无论往哪里去，我要跟从你。」58耶稣说：「狐狸有洞，天空的飞鸟有窝，只是人子没有枕头的地方。」

    a. Jesus makes no promises of a prosperous or easy life on earth. A steward-disciple must be willing to sacrifice and endure hardships.

    耶稣没有应许一个在地上富裕或轻松的生活。一个管家-门徒必须愿意牺牲并忍受艰难。

    Luke 9:59-60 - He said to another man, "Follow Me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."

    路加福音9:59-60----59 又对一个人说：「跟从我来！」那人说：「主，容我先 回去埋葬我的父亲。」60 耶稣说：「任凭死人埋葬他们的死人，你只管去传扬　神国的道。」

    b. Jesus' work is both urgent and important. A steward-disciple cannot put Jesus off until later. He must let Jesus have top priority in his/her life.

    耶稣的工作是紧急和重要的。一个管家-仆人不能把耶稣放在后面。他必须把耶稣看作他/她生命中的头等大事。

    Luke 9:61-62 - Still another said, "I will follow You, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family." Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."

    路加福音9:61-62----61 又有一人说：「主，我要跟从你，但容我先去辞别我家里的人。」62 耶稣说：「手扶着犁向后看的，不配进　神的国。」

    c. Jesus wants no one and nothing to prevent us from following Him. A steward-disciple must give undivided attention to the task of serving Jesus.

    耶稣不愿任何人任何事阻挡我们来跟从祂。一个管家-仆人必须好不分心的来做成服事耶稣的工作。

##### B. Jesus Desires A Response Of Trust In Him As The Lord 耶稣希望人的回应是相信祂为主的。

John 6:66-69 - From this time, many of His disciples turned back and no longer followed Him. "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve. Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."

约翰福音6:66-69----66 从此，他门徒中多有退去的，不再和他同行。67 耶稣就 对那十二个门徒说：「你们也要去吗？」68 西门·彼得回答说：「主啊，你有永生之道，我们还归从谁呢？69 我们已经信了，又知道你是　神的圣者。」

1. Steward-discipleship is based on the personal conviction that Jesus is our Savior and Lord.

    管家门徒是基于个人的认信，相信耶稣是我们的救赎者和主。

2. The Greek word Κύριος (Kurios), which we translate as "Lord" means "one who is in control and to whom others owe allegiance." As our Lord, Jesus is in the position of supreme authority over us. We owe Him our unquestioning, absolute loyalty.

    希腊文Κύριος (Kurios)，我们们通常把它翻译为“主”，它的意思是“能够主宰且是别人所效忠的人”。耶稣作为我们的主，具有高过我们所有人的权柄，我们对祂负有毫不质疑绝对的忠诚。

3. We must always remember that Jesus gives us what no one else does. He gives us eternal life.

    我们必须常常记得耶稣赐给我们的是任何人都不能给予的。祂赐给我们永生。

##### C. Jesus Desires A Response Of Obedience To Him As the Lord 耶稣希望一个顺服祂为主的回应

Luke 6:46 - "Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord', and do not do what I say?"

路加福音 6:46 - 「你们为什么称呼我『主啊，主啊』却不遵我的话行呢？ 　　　　

John 14:23-24a - Jesus replied, "If anyone loves Me, he will obey My teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love Me will not obey My teaching."

约翰福音14:23-24a----23耶稣回答说：「人若爱我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必 爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。24不爱我的人就不遵守我的道。你们所听见的道不是我的，乃是差我来之父的道。

1. Obedience to Jesus' commands is not optional. It is essential to being a steward and a disciple.

    顺服耶稣的命令并不是一个可选项。这对于成为一个管家和仆人来说是至关重要的。

2. Our obedience or lack of obedience reveals much about our love or lack of love for Jesus.

    我们的顺服或不顺服大大显示出我们是否爱耶稣。

3. Consider the artist who painted a picture of Jesus and then confessed, "If I would love Jesus more, I would paint Him better."

    思考有个艺术家为耶稣做了一张画像，之后他坦承，“如果我更爱耶稣，我将会把祂画的更好。”

##### D. Jesus Desires That His Steward-Disciples Serve Him With An Eager, Willing Spirit  耶稣希望祂的管家-仆人以愿做和渴求的心来服事祂

Luke 17:7-10 - "Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat?' Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink? Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty."

路加福音17:7-10----7你们谁有仆人耕地或是放羊，从田里回来，就对他说：『你快来坐下吃饭』呢？8岂不对他说：『你给我预备晚饭，束上带子伺候我，等我吃喝完了，你才可以吃喝』吗？9仆人照所吩咐的去做，主人还谢谢他吗？10 这样，你们做完了一切所吩咐的，只当说：『我们是无用的仆人，所做的本是我们应分做的。』」

1. Our Lord wants us to have the mindset of humble, diligent servants, who understand their duty and carry it out.

    我们的主希望我们有谦卑、勤勉的仆人之心，能明白他们的职责并付之以实践。

2. Jesus wants us to be people who serve Him gladly and without complaint.

    耶稣希望我们成为毫无怨言、欢喜服事祂的人。

#### III. The Lord Rejects All Other Responses 主拒绝所有其他的回应

In this section, we will examine a number of frequently given, but totally unacceptable responses to the Lord's call to discipleship.

在这一节中我们将查考一系列对主耶稣门徒的呼召常有的，但却完全不可接受的回应。

##### A. "Jesus, I Do Not Want You As My Savior-Lord." (Outright Rejection)

“耶稣，我不愿你作为我的救主”（直接的拒绝）

John 3:36b - "Whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."

约翰福音3:36b - 不信子的人得不着永生，　神的震怒常在他身上。

John 8:24b - "If you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins."

约翰福音8:24b - 所以我对你们说，你们要死在罪中。你们若不信我是基督，必要死在罪中。」

Those who reject Jesus' call will, in turn, be rejected by Him and will be forced to suffer the damning consequences of their sins.

那些拒绝耶稣的呼召的人将要反过来被耶稣拒绝并且将要遭受他们罪所带来的咒诅。

##### B. "Jesus, I Will Take You As My Savior, But Not As My Lord." (Cheap Grace) “耶稣，我愿你做我的救赎者，但不要你做我的主”（廉价的恩典）

1. This response suggests that a person can take Jesus' blessings and then go on and live however that person pleases without the response of thankful obedience. Someone has expressed this attitude in these words: "Jesus, I am glad that You died for me, but I am not willing to live for You."

    这样的回应显示出一个人愿意接受耶稣的祝福接着去过一个这个人自己要的生活毫无感恩顺服的回应。有人这样表达出这种态度“耶稣，我很高兴你为我而死，但是我却不愿意为你而活”

    Jude 4b - They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.

    犹大书4因为有些人偷着进来，就是自古被定受刑罚的，是不虔诚的，将我们 神的恩变作放纵情欲的机会，并且不认独一的主宰—我们主耶稣基督。

    Luke 9:23 - Then He said to them all: "If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me." (Here Jesus requires followers to renounce the idea that they own their own lives and also to voluntarily endure hardship for Him.)

    路加福音9:23 -耶稣又对众人说：「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，天天背起他的十字架来跟从我。(在这里耶稣要求追随祂的人弃绝他们掌控自己生活的想法并且自愿的为祂忍受艰难)

2. No one has the option of rejecting Jesus' Lordship over his/her life. Whoever will not have Jesus as Lord cannot have Him as Savior either.

    没有人有资格选择拒绝耶稣做他/她们生命的主。无论谁不愿耶稣为主也都不能得到耶稣做他们的救主。

3. Cheap grace is a great problem in the Christian church. Note Neil Strait's comment: "Christ on our cross is the way Calvary reads. He died for us - in our place. We, then, are in debt to Him. It is strange that, so often, we act as if we owe Him nothing."

    廉价的恩典是基督教会的重大问题。注意Neil Strait 的评论：“在我们十字架上的基督是髑髅地上的耶稣。祂为我们而死。我们因此亏欠祂。然而，我们却常常表现得好像对祂毫无亏欠”

##### C. "Jesus, You are important, but not all-important to me." (Divided Love) “耶稣，你很重要，但对我来说并不是至关重要的”（拆分的爱）

Matthew 6:24 - "No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money."

马太福音6:24 - 「一个人不能事奉两个主；不是恶这个、爱那个，就是重这个、轻那个。你们不能又事奉　神，又事奉玛门。」

Matthew 10:37 - "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me."

马太福音10:37 - 爱父母过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；爱儿女过于爱我的，不配作我的门徒；

1. Jesus must be pre-eminent in the life of His steward-disciples, not just prominent.

    耶稣必须是在祂的管家-门徒生命中居首位而不仅仅是比较重要。

2. Consider the case of the reluctant lover. He professed his great love for a woman, but shared his affection with another woman.

    想想一个勉为其难的爱人的例子。他深爱着一个女人，又同时与另一个女人热恋。

##### D. "Jesus I will consider the matter of Your call later. I have other things to do now." (Pre-occupation and Delay) “耶稣我会以后考虑你的呼召，我现在还有其他的事要做”（牵挂和拖延）

Luke 12:19-20 - And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry." But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?" This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself, but is not rich toward God.

路加福音12:19-20----19然后要对我的灵魂说：灵魂哪，你有许多财物积存，可 作多年的费用，只管安安逸逸地吃喝快乐吧！』20神却对他说：『无知的人哪，今夜必要你的灵魂；你所预备的要归谁呢？』

2 Corinthians 6:1-2 - As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain. For He says, "In the time of My favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, 'Now is the time of God's favor; now is the day of salvation.'

哥林多后书6:1-2----1 我们与　神同工的，也劝你们不可徒受他的恩典。2 因为 他说：「在悦纳的时候，我应允了你；在拯救的日子，我搭救了你。」看哪，现在正是悦纳的时候！现在正是拯救的日子；

1. Jesus wants a prompt response to His call. Delay in this matter is "the deadliest form of denial."

    耶稣希望人对祂的呼召有迅速的回应。这时的拖延是“致命的拒绝”。

2. God graciously extends His call and is free to withdraw it as He wishes. Anyone who postpones consideration and response to His call plays a dangerous game with God's mercy and risks losing all opportunity to become a steward-disciple. God's gracious call is truly a "limited time offer."

    神恩赐的扩展祂的呼召并且祂可凭自己的意愿撤回。任何人拖延对待或回应祂的呼召都是冒着失去所有成为管家-门徒的风险的机会，拿神的恩典来做危险的赌博，神恩赐的呼召实在可称为“限时的机会”

##### E. "Jesus, I Will Just Stay Neutral Toward You." (Spiritual Fence-Straddling) “耶稣我想与你和平共处”（灵里的墙头草）

Matthew 12:30 - He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

马太福音12:30 - 不与我相合的，就是敌我的；不同我收聚的，就是分散的。」

Revelation 3:15-16 - "I know your deeds, that you are neither cold, nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth." (Jesus to the church in Laodicea)

启示录3:15-16----15 我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。 16 你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。

A person cannot remain indifferent to Jesus Christ. Not to choose for Him is to choose against Him.

人不可能对耶稣持无关紧要的态度。不选择跟从祂即是选择抵挡祂。

#### IV. Your Personal Response To The Lord's Call 你对主呼召的个人回应
##### A. Christ's Call To Be His Steward-Disciples Has Come To You 从基督而来要成为祂管家-仆人的呼召临到你了。

1. "Today, as on the memorable occasions when He first gave the command, 'Follow Me!' the Savior again and again repeats His call to steward-discipleship. It is a call to those who have not know Him before, but who need Him above all else. It is a call to those who, like Peter, have until now followed Him only from a distance. It is a call to those who, like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, have been His disciples only in secret. It is a call to those who, like the multitudes of His day, have been following Him only out of curiosity. It is a call to those who have been His followers in name only, because they have hoped to find some personal advantage in it. It is a call to those who, like Judas, have been disloyal to Him. It is a call to every man, woman, and child, to repent, to follow Him, to take up their cross, and to lose their life in this world for His sake that they might find eternal life in heaven."

    “今天，在这纪念祂首次发出‘来跟从我’的命令的时刻，救主再次多番的重复祂对管家-仆人的呼召。这个呼召是对那些之前不认识祂，但却无比的需要祂的人发出的。这个呼召是对像彼得一样还是远远的跟随祂的人发出的。这个呼召是对像尼哥底母和亚利马太一样暗暗的做祂门徒的人发出的。这个呼召是是像在那时仅仅因为好奇而追随祂的人发出的。这个呼召是对那些仅在名义上做祂门徒的人发出的，因为这些人是想要靠此为自己得些好处。这个呼召是向像犹大一样背叛祂的人发出的。这个呼召是向每个男人、女人、孩童发出的，要召他们悔改、跟随祂，背起自己的十字架，为祂的缘故舍弃在这个世上的生命以至于可在天上得永生”

2. Through His Word, the Lord Jesus calls you to deeper commitment as His steward-disciple.

    透过祂的话语，主耶稣呼召你更深的委身做祂的管家-门徒。

##### B. Consider The Lord's Call With The Greatest Of Care 要竭力留心主的呼召

Luke 14:25-27 - 25) Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them He said, 26) "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters - yes, even his own life - he cannot be My disciple. 27) And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple." * (Note: the word "hate" in verse 26 means "to love less than Jesus")

路加福音14:25-27----25有极多的人和耶稣同行。他转过来对他们说：26「人到我这里来，若不爱我胜过爱（原文为恨）自己的父 母、妻子、儿女、弟兄、姊妹，和自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒。27凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒。(注释：在26节中的“恨”意为胜过对耶稣的爱)

1. Jesus requires unconditional devotion to Him above all others.

    耶稣要求我们对祂有超越一切的无条件的委身。

    Luke 14:28-30 - Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, saying, "This fellow began to build and was not able to finish."

    路加福音14:28-30----28你们哪一个要盖一座楼，不先坐下算计花费，能盖成不 能呢？29恐怕安了地基，不能成功，看见的人都笑话他，说：30『这个人开了工，却不能完工。』

2. Jesus summons us to give deep, serious thought to the matter of being His steward-disciple.

    耶稣要我们深刻、严肃的思考成为祂管家-仆人的事。

3. Jesus also cautions us against an "easy believism", that is, fostering illusions of spiritual success and victory without the cost of self-sacrifice.

    耶稣还警告我们抵挡“肤浅的信仰”，就是抱有属灵成功的幻想和无需任何牺牲的得胜。

    Luke 14:31-33 - Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple?

    路加福音14:31-33----31 或是一个王出去和别的王打仗，岂不先坐下酌量，能用 一万兵去敌那领二万兵来攻打他的吗？32 若是不能，就趁敌人还远的时候，派使 者去求和息的条款。33 这样，你们无论什么人，若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作 我的门徒。」

    Hebrews 2:3 - How shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation?

    希伯来书2:3 - 我们若忽略这么大的救恩，怎能逃罪呢？

4. Jesus warns us of the impending judgment of God on our lives. He advises that we take the way of escape provided through faith in Him as our Savior.

    耶稣警告我们那从神而来的审判即将临到我们的生活中，祂劝告我们藉着相信祂做我们的救主来脱离。

    1 Thessalonians 1:5a, 6b - Because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. . . You welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.

    帖撒罗尼迦前书1:5a - 因为我们的福音传到你们那里，不独在乎言语，也在乎权能和圣灵，并充足的信心。

    帖撒罗尼迦前书1:6b - 并且你们在大难之中，蒙了圣灵所赐的喜乐，领受真道就效法我们，也效法了主；

    Philippians 2:13; 4:13 - It is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose. . . I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.

    腓立比书2:13 - 因为你们立志行事都是　神在你们心里运行，为要成就他 的美意。

    腓立比书4:13 - 我靠着那加给我力量的，凡事都能做。

5. God helps us overcome our sinful resistance to Jesus' call. God the Holy Spirit works powerfully through God's Word to persuade us to believe in Jesus Christ, embrace His Word and accept His call to be His believing servants.

    神帮助我们克服我们罪性中对神呼召的抗拒，圣灵有力的藉着神的话语劝服我们相信耶稣基督，接受祂的话语并且领受祂的呼召成为祂忠信的仆人。

    Philippians 3:7-11 - But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of know Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider these rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ - the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death, and so somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.

    腓立比书3:7-11----7 只是我先前以为与我有益的，我现在因基督都当作有损的。8 不但如此，我也将万事当作有损的，因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事，看作粪土，为要得着基督；9 并且得以在他里面，不是有自己因律法而得的义，乃是有信基督的义，就是因信　神而来的义，10 使我认识基督，晓得他复活的大能，并且晓得和他一同受苦，效法他的死，11或者我也得以从死里复活。

6. The Holy Spirit works in us the conviction that Jesus Christ and His blessings is worth giving up everything in order to posses. Because of the Holy Spirit's persuasive work, we can eagerly pursue the life of faith and steward-discipleship to which Christ calls us.

    圣灵在我们里面工作，使我们确信耶稣基督和祂的赐福是值得我们放弃所有来获得的。因为圣灵的劝导，我们可以渴望寻求信心的生活并做按照基督的呼召做管家-仆人。
