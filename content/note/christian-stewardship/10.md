#### I, Reviewing The Five Step Approach To Discovering Spiritual Gifts 复习发现属灵恩赐的五个步骤

A. Explore The Possibilities. Through your study of spiritual gifts and your taking of the Spiritual Gifts and Talents Survey, you are on the way to identifying your spiritual gifts. You will want to reflect on the meaning of the gifts themselves and the meaning they have for you personally as a steward-disciple of Jesus Christ. Continued reading and study of the Bible and helpful Bible-based materials will aid you in gaining a more complete understanding of the gifts which the Lord gives His people.

探索可能性。 通过你对属灵恩赐的学习和属灵恩赐与天赋的测验，你正在确认你自己的属灵恩赐。你会想要把恩赐的自身含义与对你自己作为主耶稣基督管家-门徒的意义对照。继续阅读及学习圣经和有帮助的以圣经为基础的参考材料，会帮助你获得关于上帝赐给他子民的恩赐更加全面的理解。

B. Experiment With As Many As Possible. You will have to try the particular gifts you have discovered through the survey to know whether you actually have them or not. Consider service opportunities that will give you a chance to use the abilities God has given you. Experiment with each possible gift by trying to use them in the ministry of the Church.

尽可能多地去试验。 你必须去试着使用这些通过测试所发掘的特殊的恩赐，这样才能知道你是否真的拥有这些恩赐。多考虑那些能使你有机会运用上帝所赐能力的服侍的机会。通过在教会的事工中使用的方式试验每一种可能拥有的恩赐。

C. Examine Your Feelings. It is a encouraging sign when you experiment with a gift and find that you enjoy what you are doing with it. Dislike for the service areas of a particular gift may indicate that you do not possess a certain gift. You should find some satisfaction in using your gifts.

检验你的感觉。 当你试验一种恩赐并发现你在使用它的时候很享受，这就是一种令人鼓舞的预兆。不喜欢一种特定恩赐的服侍领域也许暗示着你并不拥有这项恩赐。你应该在使用你的恩赐的时候觉得愉快。

D. Evaluate Your Effectiveness. Spiritual gifts are given to be used for the benefit of others. God has designed each gift to help accomplish specific objectives. As you use your gifts, you should see positive (although not always dramatic) results taking place. Employ your gifts and patiently wait for signs of effectiveness. If, after faithful effort, you are not experiencing some positive results, it may be that you do not have that particular gift.

评估你的效力。 属灵恩赐是为了他人的益处被赐下的。上帝设计每种恩赐是为了帮助达成特定的目的。当你使用你的恩赐的时候，你应该看到积极的（虽然并不总是戏剧性的）结果发生。发掘你的恩赐并耐心等待有效果的征兆。如果在付出真正的努力后，你没有经历到好的结果，也许是因为你并不拥有那种特定恩赐。

E. Expect Confirmation From Fellow Believers. God gives spiritual gifts to build up others members of the Body of Christ. Other Christians can help you recognize your gifts and give you confirmation of them. Ask for feedback and evaluation from caring, concerned members of the Church to help you assess whether you have the gifts that you are trying to identify.

期待同工的肯定。 上帝赐下属灵恩赐是为了建立基督身体的其他肢体。其他的基督徒能帮你认出你的恩赐并为你确认。向教会中热心的、关心的肢体寻求反馈和评价，来帮助你评估是否拥有你试图确认的恩赐。

#### II. The Faithful Management Of Our Bodies And Minds 信实地管理我们的身体和心灵

A. Our Lord has created us with wonderful bodies and minds.

我们的主为我们创造了奇妙的身体和心灵。

Psalm 139:13-14 - For You created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Your works are wonderful. I know that full well."

诗篇139:13-14----13我的肺腑使你所造的。我在母腹中，你已覆庇我。14 我要称谢你，因我受造奇妙可畏。你的作为奇妙，这是我心深知道的。

Job 38:36 - (God asks Job the question) "Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?"

约伯记38:36 （上帝问约伯）谁将智慧放在怀中？谁将聪明赐于心内？

B. Our Savior has mercifully redeemed us so that we can willingly manage our bodies and minds for His glory and use.

我们的救赎主仁慈地拯救了我们，因此我们乐意为了他的荣耀和使用管理我们的身体和心灵。

Romans 12:1 - Therefore, I urge, you brothers, in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God - which is your spiritual worship.

罗马书12:1 所以弟兄们，我以神的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上，当做活祭，是圣洁的，是神所喜悦的，你们如此侍奉，乃是理所当然的。

1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.

哥林多前书6:19-20----19 岂不知你们的身子就是圣灵的殿吗？这圣灵是从神而来，住在你们里头的；并且你们不是自己的人，20 因为你们是重价买来的，所以要在你们的身子上荣耀神。

* When Robert Varley said: "It remains to be seen what God can do with a person who is entirely consecrated to Him," Dwight L. Moody answered, "By the grace of God I will be that person." In a similar way, Christians who believe the Gospel of the Savior's forgiving grace will answer in the strength the Holy Spirit gives: "Since Christ has redeemed all there is of me, He shall have my total powers. All that I am and all that I have I lay at His feet to be used according to His will."

* 当罗伯特·瓦利说：“我们仍然可以看到上帝能用一个神圣奉献的人做什么。”德怀特·莱曼·穆迪回答：“因神的恩典我将作那个人。”同样地，相信救赎主宽恕恩典的基督徒将用圣灵赐下的能力回答：“既然基督救赎了我的一切，他就拥有我所有的力量。我所是的及我所拥有的都因着他的意愿放在他脚下供他使用。”

Haggai 2:8 - "The silver is mine and the gold is mine," declared the Lord.

哈该书2:8 万军之耶和华说：“银子是我的，金子也是我的。”

Psalm 24:1 - The earth is the Lord's, and everything is in it, the world, and all who live in it.

诗篇24:1 地和其中所充满的，世界和住在其间的，都属耶和华。

1. Our Lord is the Owner of all things, including all material treasures.

    我们的主是万物的所有者，包括所有的物质财富。

    1 Chronicles 29:12a, 14b - Wealth and honor come from You; You are the Ruler of all things . . . Everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your hand.

    历代志上29:12a，14b

    12a 丰富尊荣都从你而来，你也治理万物。

    14b 因为万物都从你而来，我们把从你而得的献给你！

2. Whatever money and possession we have come solely from the Lord's gracious blessing.

    无论我们拥有的财富还是产业都只来自主的慷慨祝福。

B. Our Lord calls us to manage our money and possessions for Him.

我们的主呼召我们为他管理我们的财富和产业。

Luke 19:13 - So he (the master) called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas (a mina was equal to about 3 months of income). "Put this money to work," he said, "until I come back."

路加福音19:13 便叫了他的十个仆人来，交给他们十锭银子，说 ：“你们拿去做生意，直等我回来。”

Matthew 6:33 - But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

马太福音6:33 你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。

1. All we have is to be used to fulfill God's purpose in our own life and to assist in fulfilling that purpose in the lives of others.

    我们所拥有的就是被用来在我们的生命中成就主的目的，并帮助在他人的生命中成就主的目的。

2. "I will place no value on anything I have or may possess except in its relation to the kingdom of God. Anything I have will be given or kept according as giving or keeping it I shall promote the kingdom of my Savior." - David Livingstone, missionary to Africa

    “除了与主国度相关的事物，我不认为任何我拥有的或也许拥有的事物有任何价值。任何我所拥有的事物都将通过施与或保存的方式用于我推进救主的国度这件事。”——大卫·利文斯通，非洲传教士

3. "Money management is not an option. The Christian choice is not 'to manage or not to manage.' The choice is between effective and ineffective management." -Waldo Werning

    “管理财富并不是一项选择。基督式的选择并不是 ‘管理或不管理’。这个选择是介于有效和无效管理之间的。”——沃尔顿·沃宁

C. Our Lord calls us to be content with what He permits us to have or achieve under His blessed direction of our lives.

我们的主呼召我们满足于他允许我们拥有的或达到我们在他的祝福下的生命方向。

Hebrews 13:5 - Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."

希伯来书13:5 你们存心不可贪爱钱财，要以自己所有的为足。因为主曾说：“我总不撇下你，也不丢弃你。”

1 Timothy 6:6-10 - But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

提摩太前书6:6-10----6然而，敬虔加上知足的心便是大利了。7因为我们没有带什么到世上来，也不能带什么去。8只要有衣有食，就当知足。9但那些想要发财的人，就陷在迷惑、落在网罗和许多无知有害的私欲里，叫人沉在败坏和灭亡中。10贪财是万恶之根！有人贪恋钱财，就被引诱离了真道，用许多愁苦把自己刺透了。

D. Our Lord calls us to forsake worry over material possessions by assuring us that He will provide for the earthly needs of His committed followers.

我们的主呼召我们放弃对物质产业的担忧，他使我们确信，他会为他忠实的门徒提供世上所需。

Matthew 6:25-34 - Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. they do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?" For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

马太福音6:25-34----25所以我告诉你们：不要为生命忧虑吃什么，喝什么；为身体忧虑穿什么。生命不胜于饮食吗？身体不胜于衣裳吗？26你们看那天上的飞鸟，也不种，也不收，也不积蓄在仓里，你们的天父尚且养活它。你们不比飞鸟贵重得多吗？27你们哪一个能用思虑使寿数多加一刻呢？28何必为衣裳忧虑呢？你想，野地里的百合花怎么长起来？它也不劳苦，也不纺线。29然而我告诉你们：就是所罗门极荣华的时候，他所穿戴的还不如这花一朵呢！30你们这小信的人哪！野地里的草今天还在，明天就丢在炉里，神还给它这样的妆饰，何况你们呢？31所以，不要忧虑说:“吃什么？喝什么？穿什么？”32这都是外邦人所求的。你们需用的这一切东西，你们的天父是知道的。33你们要先求他的国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。34所以，不要为明天忧虑，因为明天自有明天的忧虑；一天的难处一天当就够了。

#### Ⅳ. Christian Principles For Giving 基督教的施舍准则

A. 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 are two of the best chapters in the Bible to study the matter of principles for Christian giving. Please read over these two chapters and note how Saint Paul unfolds precious truths for steward-disciples to understand and apply in the area of giving back to God from the financial and material blessings He has given us.

哥林多后书8章和9章是圣经中学习基督教施舍事物准则的最好的篇章。请通读这两章经文并注意圣保罗如何为管家-门徒展开了一些宝贵的真理，使他们理解并把这些真理应用于归还主赐下的经济和物质祝福的领域中。

B. Ten Important Scriptural Principles Of Christian Giving

基督徒施舍的十个重要圣经准则

2 Corinthians 8:3 - For I testify that they (the Macedonian believers) gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability.

哥林多后书8:3 我可以证明他们是按着力量，而且也过了力量，自己甘心乐意地捐助。

1. Christians give according to their resources, their awareness of needs and opportunities, and especially according to the strength of their faith and love.

    基督徒通过他们的资源、他们意识到的需要和机会，尤其是通过他们的信心和爱的力量来施舍。

    There are 3 main factors that determine the size and amount of gifts believers give for God's work. The factors are the amount of resources God has allowed them to gain, the understanding they have of the work God wants them to do and the level of their faith in and love for God. The most important of these factors is the level of faith and love. The Macedonian Christians are a good example of this. They were not wealthy people, but they did understand the need of their fellow believers in Judea and the opportunity they were being given to support God's work. Above all, they had a very strong faith in Christ and a deep love for the Lord and for people. This led them to give very generously and far more that Paul thought that they could.

    有三个主要因素决定了信徒为上帝的工作献出的礼物的大小和数量。 这些因素有：上帝允许他们获取的资源的数量；他们对上帝想要他们做的工作的理解；还有他们对上帝的信心和爱的程度。这些因素中最重要的是信心和爱的程度。马其顿的基督徒是一个很好的例子。他们并不富有，但他们能够理解犹大地区信徒的需要和能为上帝的工作施舍的机会。最重要的是，他们对基督有着坚定的信心，对主和人们有着深沉的爱。这就带领他们施舍非常慷慨并远超过保罗认为他们所能施舍的。

    2 Corinthians 8:5b - But they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.

    哥林多后书8:5b 更照神的旨意，先把自己献给主，又归附了我们。

2. Christian giving begins with the believer willingly giving one's own self to the Lord as the first gift.

    基督徒的施舍始于信徒自愿把自己作为献给主的第一份礼物。

    Christian giving is first an attitude of devotion in the heart. Then it becomes an action in one's life. Christian giving begins with a believer's heart gratefully devoted to God, a heart which says, "God, all I am and all I have are yours. Take me and use me for Your purposes."

    基督徒的施舍首先是一种心中有奉献的态度。然后再成为一个人生活 中的行为。基督徒的施舍始于信徒感激地奉献上帝的心，这颗心会说：“主啊，我所是的及我所有的全都是你的。因你的目的拿走我，使用我。”

    2 Corinthians 8:7 - But just as you excel in everything - in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us - see that you also excel in this grace of giving.

    哥林多后书8:7 你们既然在信心、口才、知识、热心和待我们的爱心上，都格外显出满足来，就当在这慈惠的事上也格外显出满足来。

3. Giving is an ability that God graciously gives His believers and at which they can improve and excel.

    施舍是上帝仁慈地赐给他的信徒的一种能力，使他们能够在其上得到进步和超越 。

    Giving for God's purposes is an ability that God lovingly empowers His Christians to do. As a gift of God's grace, giving is a quality that enriches the lives of Christ's disciples. It is an ability that believers can make progress in and at which they should seek to excel out of thanks for the Lord's saving love for them.

    为上帝的目标施舍是一种上帝慈爱地授予基督徒行事的能力。作为神恩典的礼物，施舍是能够丰富基督徒生命的一种品质。这是一种能力，信徒能在他们应寻求其上和其中取得进步，并当为神给他们的拯救的爱寻求献上感谢。

    2 Corinthians 8:9 - For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.

    哥林多后书8:9 你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典。他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。

4. Christian giving is a believing response to the sacrificial work and gift of Jesus Christ

    基督徒施舍是对耶稣基督献祭工作和礼物的信仰回应。

    Giving for God's work is inspired by and characteristic of God's great gift to us in Jesus Christ, our Savior. Although the Lord Jesus possessed all riches as the glorious Son of God, He gave them all up for us. He chose to live a humble life of obedience and to suffer and die for our sins so that we might share in all the riches of God. Christian giving is to done in the awareness of this great gift of saving grace and in appreciation for the One who gave it to us.

    为上帝的工作施舍是以神在我们救主耶稣基督身上赐给我们的伟大礼物所激励和为特点的。尽管主耶稣作为上帝荣耀之子拥有所有的财富，但他为我们放弃了一切。他选择过一种顺从谦卑的生活，并为我们的罪经历痛苦和死亡，如此我们也许能在主的所有财富上有份。基督徒施舍是在意识到这样拯救恩赐的伟大礼物和对赐给我们这样礼物的主的感激之上所完成的。

    2 Corinthians 8:11-12a - Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means. For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable.

    哥林多后书8：11 如今就当办成这事。既有愿做的心，也当照你们所有的去办成，12a 因为人若有愿做的心，必蒙悦纳。

5. Christian giving flows from a Spirit-worked willingness to give.

    基督徒施舍来自圣灵感化去施舍的愿望

    The Holy Spirit creates a willingness and eagerness in Christians to give for God's causes. He produces this willingness and eagerness as a fruit of the faith that He creates and strengthens in believers through the Gospel in Word and Sacrament. God -pleasing giving cannot be produced by the Law or mere human persuasion or pressure.

    圣灵在基督徒心中创造了为了上帝的缘故去施舍的愿望和热心。通过福音的语言和圣礼，他创造并坚固了信徒的信心，这信心的果实乃是他所创造的施舍的愿望和热心。蒙神喜悦的施舍无法通过律法或只是人的劝说、压力所产生。

    2 Corinthians 8:12 - For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable, according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.

    哥林多后书8:12 因为人若有愿做的心，必蒙悦纳，乃是照他所有 的，并不是照他所无的。

6. Christians give according to the way that God has blessed them.

    基督徒施舍是通过神所祝福的途径进行的

    God's people cannot give what they do not have. Christians can only give from what they have first received from God. God has blesses His disciples in varying amounts of material resources. He loves all His believers the same. However, in His wisdom, He is pleased to give some of His followers more material possessions than He gives to others. So, one Christian may not be able to give the same amount as another who has been blessed with more. However every believer can give generously according to the way God has blessed him/her.

    神的子民无法施舍他们没有的东西。基督徒只能施舍那些他们先从上帝那里得来的。上帝在不同的物质资源数目上祝福他的门徒。他同样地爱着所有的信徒。但是，因着他的智慧，他喜欢赐给一些门徒更多的物质产业超过其他门徒。因此，一个基督徒也许不能像其他被神祝福赐予更多产业的信徒那样给予同样的施舍。但是每个信徒都能通过神对他/她的祝福来慷慨施舍。

    2 Corinthians 8:13-14a - Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality. At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need.

    哥林多后书8:13-14a----13我原不是要别人轻省，你们受累，14a 乃要均平，就是要你们的富余，现在可以补他们的不足，使他们的富余，将来也可以补你们的不足。

    2 Corinthians 9:12 - This service you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expression of thanks to God.

    哥林多后书9:12 因为办这供给的事，不但补圣徒的缺乏，而且叫许多人越发感谢神。

7. Christian giving is carried out in loving, cooperation with fellow believers in Christ.

    基督徒施舍是通过与同在基督中的信徒的爱和合作所实施的。

    Christian giving concerns not only ourselves, but also our brothers and sisters in faith in God's family. Believers give as part of the Church to help meet the needs of others. Christians give to mutually benefit each other. Giving is an activity meant to help the entire family of believers. It is to be done with a compassionate, cooperative spirit.

    基督徒施舍不仅关乎我们自身，也关乎同在上帝家中的其他兄弟姐妹。信徒的施舍作为教会的一部分来帮助提供他人的需要。基督徒施舍是双方受益的。施舍是一种对帮助全体信徒家庭的重要行为。需要 用慈悲、合作的心才能完成。

    2 Corinthians 9:5a - So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gifts you had promised.

    哥林多后书9:5a 因此 ，我想不得不求那几位弟兄先到你们那里去，把从前所应许的捐资预备妥当。

8. Christian Giving requires planning and commitments

    基督徒施舍需要计划和承诺

    The vital step between the attitude of willingness to serve God through giving and the action of giving itself is the thoughtful, decisive commitment of what amount and in what manner to give. The Corinthians had promised a generous gift for God's work. They understood that Christian giving requires more than fond wishes and empty words. They knew it requires a thoughtful, specific, decided resolve for the gift to actually be made. Making thoughtful promises to give is part of Christian giving.

    在通过施舍服侍上帝的意愿的态度和施舍行为本身之间最重要的一个步骤就是经过深思熟虑的、下定决心的关于施舍多少及如何施舍的承诺。哥林多人为上帝的工作许诺了丰盛的捐资。他们懂得基督徒施舍需要比美好的愿望和空话更多的东西。他们知道需要一种深思熟虑、详细的、下定的决心才能使捐资真正的被施舍。做出深思熟虑的施舍的承诺是基督徒施舍的一部分。

    2 Corinthians 9:6 - Remember this, whoever sows sparingly will reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

    哥林多后书9:6 少种的少收，多种的多收，这话是真的。

    2 Corinthians 9:7b-8 - God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all you need, you will abound in every good work.

    哥林多后书9:7b-8----7b 因为捐得乐意的人是神所喜爱的。8 神能将各样的恩惠多多地加给你们，使你们凡事常常充足，能多行各样善事。

    2 Corinthians 9:11 - You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.

    哥林多后书9:11 叫你们凡事富足，可以多多施舍，就藉着我们使感谢归于神。

9. Christian giving is a believing response to the gracious, trustworthy promises of God .

    基督徒施舍是对神仁慈的、可信靠的承诺的信心的回应

    God give us many promises in His Word to summon us to trust Him and to strengthen us to serve Him. Our gracious, faithful Lord invites us to believe in His Word and to respond to it with obedient action and loving service. He gives us confidence that He will keep His promises to preserve us and provide for us. Because we have that assurance, we are free and bold to do things for Him. Notice how great God's promises are: He promises His steward-disciples "generous" reaping, being "rich in every way," and "having all you need."

    上帝因他的话语赐给我们许多承诺，为了召唤我们相信他并坚固我们去服侍他。我们仁慈、信实的主邀请我们信他的话语并用顺服的行为和爱心的服侍来回应。他使我们相信，他会保守承诺，保护我们，提供我们一切所需。因为我们有了那样的保证，我们才能自由并大胆地为他做事。注意上帝的承诺是多么伟大：他承诺他的管家-门徒 “丰盛”的收获，“凡事富足”，“凡事常常充足”。

    2 Corinthians 8:8 - I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.

    哥林多后书8:8 我说这话，不是吩咐你们，乃是藉着别人的热心试验你们爱心的实在。

    2 Corinthians 9:13a - Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves.

    哥林多后书9:13a 他们从这供给的事上得了凭
据。

10. Christian giving is an evidence or proof of the genuineness of our faith and love.

    基督徒施舍是我们信心和爱心真实的证据或证明。

    Giving for the work of the Lord is a clear indicator of where our faith and hearts really are. True faith in Christ and sincere love for Him will show themselves in the tangible, visible form of giving. A person's heart is closely attached to his/her money. Generous giving is one way in which a believer shows that God possesses his/her heart. Note General Sam Houston's remark when a fellow church member rebuked him for making a gift to the church that the member thought was too large. General Houston said: "When I was baptized, my wallet was baptized also."

    为神的工作施舍清楚地表明了我们的信和心灵在哪里。对基督的忠实信仰和真爱会以实在的、可见的施舍的形式表明出来。一个人的心与他/她的金钱联系紧密。慷慨的施舍是基督徒表明神在他/她心中的一种方式。记住山姆·休斯顿将军在一个教会成员指责他为教会赠与了那位成员认为太大的礼物时的话。休斯顿将军说：“当我受洗的时候，我的钱包也受洗了。”

C. Helpful Guidelines For Our Giving To God

我们为上帝的施舍的有用的指引

1 Chronicles 29:11-12 - Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom; You are exalted as head over all. Wealth and honor come from You; You are the ruler of all things. In Your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.

历代志上29:11-12----11耶和华啊，尊大、能力、荣耀、强胜、威严都是你的；凡天上地下的都是你的；国度也是你的，并且你为至高，为万有之首。12丰富尊荣都从你而来，你也治理万物。在你手里有大能大力，使人尊大强盛都出于你。

1. Recognize God as the Generous Giver And Ultimate Owner of all that you are and have.

    认出上帝是慷慨大方的赐予者并你所是及所有的最终所有者。

    1 Corinthians 16:2a - On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income.

    哥林多前书16:2a 每逢七日的第一日，各人要照自己的进项抽出来留着。

    Proverbs 3:9a - Honor the Lord with your wealth

    箴言3:9a 你要以财物尊荣耶和华。

2. Set aside a generous, God-honoring percentage of your income for God's work

    为了上帝的工作，从你的收入中抽出慷慨的、荣耀神的份。

    Under the Old Testament Covenant with Israel, God required that His people give Him a tithe (10%) of their income. God's Old Testament people gave required sacrifices and freewill gifts in addition to the tithe. In the New Testament God commands His people to give generously in proportion to the blessings He has given them. While He teaches His steward-disciples to give back a percentage of their income for God's honor and use, He does not specify what that percentage has to be. Many Christians today use 10% as a helpful percentage to guide them in their giving. However, we are not to use that percentage in a legalistic way to tell Christians how much they must give. Nor are we to use the 10% figure as a limiting amount on how much Christians can give back to God. Many believers have the practice of giving beyond 10% of their income for God's glory and work. God wants you to set aside a percentage of your income that you think is a proper, honoring response to His blessings (both physical and spiritual) to you.

    在与以色列在旧约所立的约下，上帝要求他的子民缴纳十一税。旧约中神的子民不但缴纳十一税，还献出所必须的祭品和出于自愿献上的礼物。在新约中上帝要求他的子民慷慨地献出他祝福给他们的份。当他教导他的管家-门徒为了神的荣耀和所需把他们收入的一部分献给主，他并没有明确指出应该献出多少。今天很多基督徒用10%作为他们施舍的一个参考的比例。但是，我们并不是要用这个比例来以合法的方式来告诉基督徒他们必须捐献多少。我们也不能计划用10%来作为基督徒能归还给上帝的限额。为了神的荣耀和工作，很多基督徒实际上捐献的钱超过他们收入的10%。上帝想要你留出收入中你认为合适的、能荣耀地回应他祝福的（身体和心灵上的）一部分。

3. Inform yourself about the work of your local church and the work of your church throughout the world to become aware of the needs and opportunities for service to God. Examine also the charitable causes that are worthy of support. Then, decide in a thoughtful, prayerful manner how much you will give to each of them.

    告诉你自己你在当地教会里和整个世界上教会中的工作来认识到服侍上帝的需要和机会。同样调查那些需要支持的慈善事业。然后，以深思熟虑的、经过祷告的方式决定你会给它们捐献多少。

    1 Chronicles 28:10, 14, 17a, 18b - David praised the Lord in the presence of the whole assembly, saying: "But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your hand. . . I know, my God, that You test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things I have given willingly and with honest intent. . .keep this desire in the hearts of Your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to You."

    历代志上29:10,14,17a，18b

    10所以大卫在全体会众面前称颂耶和华，说：

    14我算什么，我的民算什么，竟能如此乐意奉献。因为万物都从你而来，我们把从你而得的献给你。

    17a我的神阿，我知道你察验人心，喜悦正直。我以正直的心乐意献上这一切物。

    18b求你使你的民常存这样的心思意念，坚定他们的心归向你，

4. Bring your offerings to church regularly and make each gift a part of your heartfelt worship.

    有规律地向教堂敬献祭品并让每份礼物成为你诚心敬拜的一部分。
