#### LIFE WITH OUR LORD 与主同在的生活

##### Managing Spiritual Gifts For Our Lord (Part 1) 为我们的主管理属灵恩赐（第一部分）


Goal: To gain a better understanding of the Lord's blessing of spiritual gifts to His steward-disciples and of His purpose in giving them.

目标：为了更好地理解主赐予我们对他的管理-门徒事工的属灵恩赐，和他赐予我们属灵恩赐的目的。

Prayer: Dear Lord Jesus, You have given us so much. By Your gracious will, we enjoy the forgiveness of sins, eternal life, the desire and strength to serve You. Another of the blessings we enjoy is our personal set of spiritual gifts. We ask You to help us understand and appreciate our spiritual gifts. May Your Holy Spirit, working through Your Word, enable us to see how these gifts help us in our life with You as steward-disciples. Amen.

祷告：亲爱的主耶稣，你赐给我们如此多。因你仁慈的旨意，我们罪得赦免，享有永生，并有侍奉你的愿望和力量。你使我们得享你另一个恩赐，就是我们自己支配属灵恩赐。求你帮助我们理解并珍惜我们的属灵恩赐。愿你的圣灵通过我们的言语做工，使我们能看到我们作为你的管家-门徒的这些恩赐如何在我们生活中帮助我们。阿门。

#### I. Our Lord Has Made His Steward-Disciples His "Priests" 我们的主使他的管家-门徒作他的“祭司”

1 Peter 2:5, 9 - You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. . . But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.

彼得前书2：5,9 

5你们来到主面前，也就像活石，被建造成灵宫，作圣洁的祭司，藉着耶稣基督奉献神所悦纳的灵祭。

9惟有你们是被拣选的族类，是有君尊的祭司，是圣洁的国度，是属神的子民，要叫你们宣扬那召你们出黑暗、入奇妙光明者的美德。

##### A. Our Lord has made each of His believers a "priest" to offer spiritual sacrifices to Him in thankfulness for His great sacrifice for us. 我们的主使每一个信他的人做“祭司”，因他为我们的伟大牺牲满怀感谢地向他献上属灵祭

1. A priest of God is essentially a person who goes to God on behalf of others and who goes to others on behalf of God.

    上帝的祭司从本质上来说是代表其他人走向神，代表神走向他人。

2. Church historian Philip Schaff defines the concept of a priest this way: "The right and duty of every believer to read the Word of God in his native language, to go directly to the throne of grace in prayer, and to take an active part in all of the affairs of the church according to his peculiar gift and calling."

    教会历史学家菲利普·沙夫用这种方式定义祭司的概念：“每个信徒都有权利和责任用自己的母语阅读上帝的话语，在祷告中直达恩典的宝座，并通过他特殊的恩赐和召唤积极参与到教会的事工中去。”

3. Cyril Eastwood gives these important insights into the priesthood of all believers: "Christ continues His ministry through His people. The church does not exist for her own purpose, but only as a servant of Christ. She serves God's purpose, but must never control it. She serves the world, but must never forsake it. Servanthood is the key to priesthood. This service, however, is an obligation; and no one may contract out of it. It is the priesthood of all believers and not merely some. So having received the benefits of Christ's Passion, the believer goes out into the life of the world to render to Christ that form of service or that ministry for which God has equipped him."

    西里尔·伊斯特伍德把非常重要的洞察力赋予所有信徒的祭司职分：“基督通过他的民众继续他的事工。教会并不是因她自己的目的所存在，而只是作为基督的仆人存在。她服务于上帝的目的，但是必不能控制。她服务于世界，但必不放弃。仆人职分是祭司职分的关键。但是，这种侍奉是一种义务，无人能不受其约束。因这是所有信徒的祭司职分，不只是其中一部分人的。所以既然得了基督受难的好处，信徒进入这世上的生活，以服侍的形式回报基督，因为上帝已装备他。”

#### II. The Holy Spirit Gives Spiritual Gifts To Believers 圣灵赐予信徒属灵恩赐

1 Corinthians 12: 1, 4, 7, 11 - Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant . . . There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them . . .. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. . . All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.

哥林多前书12:1,4,7,11

1弟兄们，论到属灵的恩赐 ，我不愿意你们不明白

4恩赐原有分别，圣灵却是一位

7圣灵显在各人身上，是叫人得益处。

11这一切都是这位圣灵所运行、随己意分给各人的。

##### A. The Holy Spirit also gives Christians special spiritual gifts ("charismata" in Greek) that are intended to be a blessing to them and to others. 圣灵同样赐予基督徒特殊的属灵恩赐（希腊语作“恩赐”），原是作为对他们和他人的祝福。

1. Spiritual gifts are divine endowments of special abilities for service given to members of the Body of Christ.

    属灵恩赐是赐予基督的肢体的特殊能力的神圣禀赋，为使其做侍奉。

2. Spiritual gifts are special attributes granted by the Holy Spirit to believers in Christ according to God's grace to be used for carrying out the ministry of the Church.

    属灵恩赐是被圣灵保证的特殊属性，通过神的恩典赐予基督的信徒，用来开展教会的事工。

3. Some characteristics of spiritual gifts are:

    属灵恩赐的特点有：

    a. Spiritual gifts are divine endowments that God gives only to believers in Christ.

    a. 属灵恩赐是上帝单单赐予基督教徒的神圣天赋。

    b. Each believer in Christ has at least one spiritual gift, but usually has a number 
of them.

    b. 每位基督徒至少拥有一项属灵恩赐，但通常都有很多恩赐。

    c. God gives spiritual gifts as free and precious favors and not because people have earned them or are deserving of them.

    c. 上帝白白赐下属灵恩赐作为珍贵礼物，不是因为人们赢得或是应得的。

    d. God gives spiritual gifts so that believers will develop and use them together with other believers for the spiritual growth and health of God's Church.

    d. 上帝赐下属灵恩赐，因此，信徒得以与其他信徒共同发展并使用这些恩赐来使神的教会的兴旺发展。

    e. God gives spiritual gifts in varying amounts and degrees as He wishes.

    
    e. 神随己意赐下不同数量和级别的属灵恩赐.


4. Spiritual gifts are different from talents.

    属灵恩赐和天赋有区别

    a. Talents are natural abilities which God gives to both believers and unbelievers, while spiritual gifts are given by God only to believers.

    a. 天赋才能是上帝同时赐给信徒和不信的人的天生能力，但是属灵恩赐是神只赋予信徒的。

    b. Talents can be used for many purposes while spiritual gifts are given for the specific purpose of building up the Church.

    
    b. 天赋可以被用于各种目的，但是属灵恩赐只能被用于兴建教会这一特殊目的。

5. Spiritual gifts are different from Christian roles and responsibilities

    属灵恩赐与基督徒角色和责任不同

    a. Christian roles are areas of Christian service which each believer has an obligation to fulfill, such as witnessing, praying, serving, giving, instructing.

    a. 基督徒角色是属于基督徒侍奉的范围，每个信徒都有义务去实现，例如见证、祷告、侍奉、施与、教导。

    b. Spiritual gifts are special endowments to believers to enable them to serve with greater effectiveness where they are gifted.

    b. 属灵恩赐是赐给信徒的特殊才能，当其被赐下时，能使信徒的服侍更有效。

    c. Many Christian roles have a corresponding spiritual gift. For example: witnessing is a Christian role and evangelism is a spiritual gift.

    c. 很多基督徒角色有相应的属灵恩赐。例如，见证是一种基督徒角色，而传福音是一种属灵恩赐。

#### III. God Has Given And Continues To Give A Variety Of Spiritual Gifts 上帝已经赐下并将继续赐下不同的属灵恩赐

Romans 12:6-8 - We each have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching; then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

罗马书12:6-8 按我们所得的恩赐，各有不同：或说预言，就当照着信心的程度说预言；或作执事，就当专一执事；或作教导的，就当专一教导；或作劝化的，就当专一劝化；施舍的，就当诚实；治理的，就当殷勤；怜悯人的，就当甘心。

1 Corinthians 12:8-10 - To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.

哥林多前书12:8-10 这人蒙圣灵赐他智慧的言语，那人也蒙这位圣灵赐他信心，还有一人蒙这位圣灵赐他医病的恩赐，又叫一人能行异能，又叫一人能作先知，又叫一人能辨别诸灵，又叫一人能说方言，又叫一人能翻方言。

1 Corinthians 12:28 - And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.

哥林多前书12:28 神在教会所设立的：第一是使徒，第二是先知，第三是教师，其次是行异能的，再次是得恩赐医病的，帮助人的，治理事的，说方言的。

Ephesians 4:11-12 - So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up.

以弗所书4:11-12 他所赐的有使徒，有先知，有传福音的，有牧师和教师。12为要成全圣徒，各尽其职，建立基督的身体。

##### A. God lists spiritual gifts that He gave/continues to give in a number of places in the New Testament epistles. These gifts can be grouped in different categories. 上帝在新约书信里列出了他赐下/将继续赐下的属灵恩赐。这些恩赐可以按不同的种类分组。

4. With the completion of the Bible and the establishment of the Christian Church, the purpose for which God gave foundational gifts has been fulfilled. We do not expect these gifts to be given now or in the future.

    随着圣经的完成和基督教会的建立，上帝赐下基础恩赐的目的已达到。我们也当明白这些恩赐无论现在还是将来都不会再有了。

Hebrews 2:3b-4 - This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

希伯来书2:3b-4 这救恩起先是主亲自讲的，后来是听见的人给我们证实了。4神又按自己的旨意，用神迹奇事和百般的异能，并圣灵的恩赐，同他们作见证。

##### C. Some of these gifts are Confirmatory/Signifying Gifts. 有些属灵恩赐是确认/标志性的。

1. A confirmatory or signifying gift is a spectacular gift given to demonstrate God's powerful reality and to affirm the truth of His Word as the Gospel was being spread throughout the world and the Church was being established.

    确认/标志性的属灵恩赐是一种奇妙非凡的恩赐，用来演示上帝强大的真相，并确保他话语的真理作为福音传遍世界并建立教会。

2. The gifts of miracles, healing, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are such gifts.

    行异能、医治人、说方言、翻方言属于此种恩赐。

    在使徒的时代，上帝赐下奇妙的能力去行异能，医治人，说方言和翻他们事先并不懂的可辨识的异国语言。

4. These exciting abilities were essential for the time they were given. Like the foundational gifts, the purpose for which God gave them has been fulfilled. We do not look for them to continue to be given in our times.

    这些令人惊叹的能力在当时是非常重要的。就像上帝向他们赐下的基础恩赐，已经被实现了。在我们的时代我们并不会再去寻求它们继续被赐下。

##### C. A Five Step Approach to discovering spiritual gifts 发现属灵恩赐的五个步骤

1. Explore The Possibilities. We will be doing this in the rest of this lesson and in the next. We will look at certain spiritual gifts and other talents in more detail.

    探索可能性。 在这节课接下来的部分及下节课我们会持续进行这一步骤。我们会注重于特定属灵恩赐及其他天赋的更多细节。

2. Experiment With As Many As Possible. You will begin to identify your spiritual gifts by taking a Spiritual Gift Analysis. If you do not try to use them, you will have a hard time knowing whether you have them or not. Volunteer to serve in areas of ministry where you can put your possible gifts into practice.

    尽可能多地去试验。 你将要开始用分析属灵恩赐的方法来确认你的属灵恩赐。如果你不试着使用它们，你很难知道自己是否拥有它们。志愿去在事工的领域中服侍，那样你可以把可能拥有的恩赐付诸实践。

3. Examine Your Feelings. Feelings can be unreliable. Christians are first and foremost guided by what the Scriptures say, not by their feelings. God, however, does give us our feelings. He uses them in a secondary way to help direct us. When we experiment with a gift and enjoy using it, that is an encouraging sign. Personal satisfaction and enthusiasm for service are indications that we have gifts in certain areas.

    检验你的感觉。 感觉可能不可靠。对基督徒来说，首先并最重要的是受圣经话语的引导，而不是受自己感觉的引导。但是，上帝确实赐给我们感觉。他用感觉来为我们做第二步的引导。 当我们试验一种恩赐并享受使用它，这就是一种令人鼓舞的迹象。各人对服侍的喜悦和热情是我们在特定领域拥有恩赐的标志。

4. Evaluate Your Effectiveness. Spiritual gifts are meant to be used for the benefit of others. As you use your gifts, you should see positive, though not necessarily astounding, results taking place. If you are not seeing positive results, it may be that you do not have a particular gift.

    评估你的效率。 属灵恩赐注定是为了他人的福利而使用的。当你使用你的恩赐的时候，你当看积极的结果，即使这种结果并不令人惊讶。如果你不看积极的结果，也许是你并不拥有特别的恩赐。

5. Expect Confirmation From The Body. Spiritual gifts are given to build up other members of the Church. Other Christians will recognize your gift and give you confirmation of it. It you think that you have a certain gift, but no one else is agreeing with you, you may reconsider whether you have that gift.

    期待肢体的证实。 属灵恩赐是为建立教会其他肢体而赐下的。其他基督徒会认出你的恩赐并为你确认。如果你认为自己拥有某种恩赐，但是其他人都不赞同你，你也许要重新考虑是否拥有那种恩赐。

    Note: Follow through each of these five steps with prayer that the Lord Himself will guide and direct you as you seek to live in thankful joy for His saving love for you.

    注释：当你寻求活在感恩的喜悦和他救恩的爱中的时候，跟随这五个步骤的每一步，祷告上帝亲自带领和指引你，

#### V. Examining Helpful Spiritual Gifts and Natural Talents 检验有益的属灵恩赐和天赋才华。

We want to take a closer look at spiritual gifts and some natural talents that God continues to give to His believers and wants to be used in the ministry of His Church. Give careful attention to them. 

我们想进一步了解属灵恩赐和某些天赋才华，上帝持续赐下它们给信徒并想使它们被用在教会的事工上。仔细注意它们。
