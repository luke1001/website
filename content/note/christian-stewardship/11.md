#### LIFE WITH OUR LORD 与主同行的生活

##### Striving To Live A Holy Life For Our Lord 为我们的主努力过圣洁的生活


Goal: To gain more scriptural understanding and spiritual strength from the Lord Jesus so that we may live holier, God-pleasing lives.

目标：为了从主耶稣那里得到对圣经更好的理解及更多的属灵力量，以使我们可以过一种更圣洁、为主喜悦的生活。

Prayer: Dear Lord God, You have made us Your very through our Savior, Jesus Christ. For this we give You hearty thanks. You have also called us to live as Your children by imitating the holiness of Jesus in our lives. For this we ask Your mighty help. Lead us to accept Your high and holy standards for our lives. Grant us the godly desire and spiritual strength to live righteously for You. In the holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask this. Amen.

祷告：亲爱的主上帝，通过我们的救主耶稣基督你使我们成为你独有的(儿女),我们为此衷心感谢你。你同样呼召我们在我们的生活中学耶稣圣洁的样式作为你的儿女而活。我们为此祈求你大能的帮助。引导我们在生活中接受你高而圣洁的标准。赐予我们神圣的愿望及属灵的力量为你过公义的生活。奉我主耶稣基督圣洁的名求，阿门。

#### I. Our Lord Calls Us To Adopt Holy Standards For Our Lives 我们的主呼召我们为我们的生活采取圣洁的标准

##### A. The Lord calls us to live holy lives. 主呼召我们过圣洁的生活

2 Timothy 1:9 - God has saved us and called us to a holy life - not because of anything we have done but because of His own purpose and grace.

提摩太后书1:9 神救了我们，以圣召召我们，不是按我们的行为，乃是按他的旨意，和恩典。这恩典是万古之先，在基督耶稣里赐给我们的。

1 Thessalonians 4:7 - For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.

帖撒罗尼迦前书4:7 神召我们，本不是要我们沾染污秽，乃是要我们成为圣洁。

1 Peter 1:15-16 - But just as He who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: "Be holy, because I am holy."

彼得前书1:15-16----15那召你们的既是圣洁的，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。16因为圣经上记着说： “你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。”

1. Our Lord calls us to be holy in response to His saving work for us and to reflect God's holiness in every aspect of our lives.

    我们的主呼召我们成为圣洁为了回应他对我们的救赎大业并要我们在生活中的每个方面反映出上帝的圣洁。

    a. The Greek word for "holy" is ἅγιος (hagios). To be ἅγιος or holy basically means "to be spiritually and morally separated from sin and dedicated to God"

    希腊语 中“圣洁”这个词是 ἅγιος (hagios)。成为 ἅγιος 或成为圣洁基本上是说“在灵性上及道德上从罪中分离出来并献给神”。

    b. The God of grace, who has declared us to be holy and innocent of our sins because of Jesus Christ, now calls us to live up to the high standards of being like Him in His moral perfection and in His abhorrence of sin.

    那宣称我们因耶稣基督成为圣洁及从罪中脱离的恩典的神，现在呼召我们活出一个高标准的生活，就是在道德完美和痛恨罪恶方面都像祂一样。

    1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 - It is God's will that you should be holy; that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know Gpd; and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you. For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you His Holy Spirit.

    帖撒罗尼迦前书4:3-8----3 神的旨意就是要你们成为圣洁，远避淫行。 4 要你们各人晓得怎样用圣洁尊贵，守着自己的身体。 5 不放纵私欲的邪情，像那不认识神的外邦人。 6 不要一个人在这事上越分，欺负他的弟兄。因为这一类的事，主必报应，正如我预先对你们说过，又切切嘱咐你们的。 7 神召我们，本不是要我们沾染污秽，乃是要我们成为圣洁。 8 所以那弃绝的，不是弃绝人，乃是弃绝那赐圣灵给你们的神。

2. The Lord is most serious about this call to holiness.
    
    我们的主严肃认真的要求我们成为圣洁

    a. Holiness of life is God's abiding will for us. God's moral will applies to us at all times in our life. It is essential, not optional. We are not free to neglect or ignore it. We are bound to follow it.

    生活的圣洁是上帝对我们的不变的旨意。上帝的道德旨意在我们生活的任何时候都是适用的。这是基本的，不是可选择的。我们没有忽视或不管它的自由。我们必须要遵守。

    b. To reject God's call to holiness is to reject God and to invite His just punishment on one's self.

    弃绝神要求我们成为圣洁的呼召就是弃绝神并会招致祂公义的惩罚降在人身上。

##### B. We are to obey the call to holiness in willing, thankful response to our Lord's immeasurably costly redemption of our lives.我们要顺从这要我们成为圣洁的呼召，自愿地、感恩地回应我主对我们生命不可测量的救赎的付出。

1 Peter 1:15-19 - But just as He who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: Be holy, because I am holy." Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear. For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.

彼得前书1:15-19----15 那召你们的既是圣洁，你们在一切所行的事上也要圣洁。 16 因为经上记着说，你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的。 17 你们既称那不偏待人，按各人行为审判人的主为父，就当存敬畏的心，度你们在世寄居的日子。 18 知道你们得赎，脱去你们祖宗所传流虚妄的行为，不是凭着能坏的金银等物。 19 乃是凭着基督的宝血，如同无瑕疵无玷污的羔羊之血。

Consider the comment of a slave girl who was purchased at an auction and then given her freedom. She asked about the man who purchased her and set her free and said: "He has paid for me and set me free. Now I must go and serve him for the rest of my life."

思考一下一个奴隶女孩的话，她在一个拍卖会上被买下并被赐予自由。她向人打听那个买下她并放她自由的人，并说：“他买下了我并放我自由。现在我要用余生服侍他来报答他。”

##### C. The call to holy living is a call to serve God willingly by doing what is right. 呼召过圣洁的生活其实是呼召通过做正确的事来甘心乐意的服侍神。

Romans 6:11-13a - In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness.

罗马书6:11-13a----11 这样，你们向罪也当看自己是死的。向神在基督耶稣里却当看自己是活的。 12 所以不要容罪在你们必死的身上作王，使你们顺从身子的私欲。 13 也不要将你们的肢体献给罪作不义的器具。

1. Because our Lord Jesus has brought us from spiritual death to spiritual life, we are to consider ourselves dead to sin and its claims on us and are to firmly refuse to serve it.

    因为我主耶稣把我们从灵性的死亡中带到灵性的生命中，对于罪及其对我们的辖制而言我们要看自己是已经死了的，并要坚决拒绝服侍它。

    Romans 6:13b, 18 - But rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness . . . You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.

    罗马书6：13b, 18

    13倒要像从死里复活的人，将自己献给神。并将肢体作义的器具献给神。

    18你们既从罪里得了释放，就作了义的奴仆。

2. Instead, we are to consider ourselves alive to God and are to devote ourselves to serve the cause of righteousness as willing slaves of the Lord and the good He desires from us.

    相反，我们要看自己在神里是活着的，并要使我们成为主的仆人致力于服事公义的事工和祂愿我们做的好事中去。

    Romans 6:20-23 - When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

    罗马书6：20-23----20 因为你们作罪之奴仆的时候，就不被义约束了。 21 你们现今所看为羞耻的事，当日有什么果子呢？那些事的结局就是死。 22 但现今你们既从罪里得了释放，作了神的奴仆，就有成圣的果子，那结局就是永生。 23 因为罪的工价乃是死。惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里乃是永生。

3. While those who serve sin receive spiritual death, those who have been set free from sin's control through Christ and who serve God in faith-demonstrating righteousness receive the wonderful blessing of eternal life.

    当那些服侍罪的人得到灵性的死亡时，那些通过基督从罪的权势下得释放的，并那些在信心中显明是以公义来服侍神的人得到了永生的美好祝福。

##### D. The call to holy living is also a call to live as God's children of light in all aspects of their life. 呼召过圣洁的生活同样是呼召在生活中的各方面作神的光明之子。

Ephesians 4:17-20 - So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

以弗所书4：17-20----17 所以我说，且在主里确实的说，你们行事，不要再像外邦人存虚妄的心行事。 18 他们心地昏昧，与神所赐的生命隔绝了，都因自己无知，心里刚硬。 19 良心既然丧尽，就放纵私欲，贪行种种的污秽。 20 你们学了基督，却不是这样。

1. No longer are we to live as those who are separated from God because of their unbelief. We are to make a radical break from indulging in spiritually sinful things.

    我们不要再像那些因为不信而与神隔绝的人那样生活了。我们要与沉溺在灵性罪恶的事情彻底决裂。

2. Saint Augustine's experience illustrates both the struggle we have against sin's power in our lives and the God's pleasing resolution to this matter. In the early days of his spiritual struggle, Augustine prayed: "Lord, save me from my sins, but not quite yet." Sometime later, he prayed: "Lord, save me from my sins, except for one I want to continue." Later, he offered the final prayer: "Lord, save me from all my sins and save me now!"

    圣奥古斯丁的经历阐述了我们在生活中反抗罪的权势的挣扎和对这件事神喜悦的解决方式。在他早期灵性的困境中，奥古斯丁祷告：“主啊，从我的罪中拯救我，但不用着急。”过了些时候，他祷告：“主啊，从我的罪中拯救我，但除了我想继续犯的罪。”再过些时候，他作了最终的祷告：“主啊，从我所有的罪中拯救我，现在就拯救我！”

    Ephesians 4:21-24 - Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires: to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

    以弗所书4:21-24----21 如果你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理， 22 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人。这旧人是因私欲的迷惑，渐渐变坏的。 23 又要将你们的心志改换一新。 24 并且穿上新人。这新人是照着神的形像造的，有真理的仁义，和圣洁。

3. We are to "change clothes" spiritually. We are to take off the old self by refusing to live according to the corrupted desires of the sinful nature. We are to put on the new self by living according to the holy desires of the believing nature.

    我们要在灵性上“换新衣”。我们要拒绝按照罪性中败坏的欲望而活从而脱去旧人，我们要按照在信的性情中产生的圣洁愿望而活从而穿上新人。

    Ephesians 4:25-32, 5:3-4 - Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin"; Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold. He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you . . . But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.

    以弗所书4:25-32----25 所以你们要弃绝谎言，各人与邻舍说实话。因为我们是互相为肢体。 26 生气却不要犯罪。不可含怒到日落。 27 也不可给魔鬼留地步。 28 从前偷窃的，不要再偷。总要劳力，亲手作正经事，就可有余分给那缺少的人。 29 污秽的言语，一句不可出口，只要随事说造就人的好话，叫听见的人得益处。 30 不要叫神的圣灵担忧。你们原是受了他的印记，等候得赎的日子来到。 31 一切苦毒，恼恨，忿怒，嚷闹，毁谤，并一切的恶毒，（或作阴毒）都当从你们中间除掉。 32 并要以恩慈相待，存怜悯的心，彼此饶恕，正如神在基督里饶恕了你们一样。

    以弗所书5:3-4----3 至于淫乱，并一切污秽，或是贪婪，在你们中间连提都不可，方合圣徒的体统。 4 淫词，妄语，和戏笑的话，都不相宜，总要说感谢的话。

4. God directs us to express holiness in specific ways in our life:

    上帝带领我们在生活中以特定的方式表现圣洁。

    |  We are to avoid 我们要避免的  |  We are to practice 我们要实行的  |
    |   ------  |  -------  |
    |  Lying 说谎  |  Speaking the truth 讲真话  |
    |  Sinful anger 罪性的生气  |  Righteous anger against sin 针对罪的公义的生气  |
    |  Stealing 偷窃  |  Productive work and sharing with others 有成效的工作并与别人分享  |
    |  Unwholesome talk 有害的交谈  |  Edifying talk 有益的交谈  |
    |  Bitterness, rage 怨恨，怒气  |  Kindness, compassion 善意，热情  |
    |  Brawling, slander, malice，Greed 争吵，诽谤，恶意，贪心  |  	Christ-like forgiveness 基督式的宽恕  |
    |  Obscenity, foolish talk, coarse joking 淫秽，愚蠢的谈话，粗鄙的笑话  |  	Thanksgiving 感恩  |

    Ephesians 5:1-2 - Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

    以弗所书5:1-2----1 所以你们该效法神，好像蒙慈爱的儿女一样。 2 也要凭爱心行事，正如基督爱我们，为我们舍了自己，当作馨香的供物，和祭物，献与神。

5. As God's dear children, we are to imitate Him. We are to live a life of sacrificial love for God and for others, just as Jesus did for us.

    作为神亲爱的孩子，我们应当效法他。我们应当过一种为神和他人奉献的生活，正如耶稣为我们所做的一样。
    
    •  Consider the reminder a father gave to his son as the son was about to move away from his childhood home. The father told the son he dearly loved and was concerned about: "Son, remember whose child you are!" We are to remember that we are children of God Himself.
    
    • 思考一位父亲对他即将离家的儿子说的话作为提醒。这位父亲告诉他所深爱及关心的儿子：“儿子，记住你是谁的孩子！”我们应当记住我们是上帝的儿女。

    Ephesians 5:5-6 - For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person - such as man is an idolater - has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.

    以弗所书5:5-6----5 因为你们确实的知道，无论是淫乱的，是污秽的，是有贪心的，在基督和神的国里，都是无分的。有贪心的，就与拜偶像的一样。 6 不要被人虚浮的话欺哄。因这些事，神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。

6. We are to live with a keen awareness of God's just punishment of sin.

    我们应当在生活中清楚地意识到神对于罪的公义的惩罚。

    Ephesians 5:7-11 - Therefore do not be partners with them. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of light consists of all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

    以弗所书5:7-11----7 所以你们不要与他们同伙。 8 从前你们是暗昧的，但如今在主里面是光明的，行事为人就当像光明的子女。 9 光明所结的果子，就是一切良善，公义，诚实。 10 总要察验何为主所喜悦的事。 11 那暗昧无益的事，不要与人同行，倒要责备行这事的人

7. We are to make no compromises with evil. Instead, we are to be living contradiction to ungodliness.

    我们不要向罪妥协。相反，要反对不虔诚的生活。

#### II. Our Lord Provides Strength To Live Holier Lives 我们的主赐我们力量去过更加圣洁的生活

##### A. God's saving grace in Jesus Christ prepares us to live godly lives. 上帝在耶稣基督里救赎的恩典预备我们过神圣的生活

Titus 2:11-14 - For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared for all men. It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope - the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself a people that are His very own, eager to do what is good.

提多书2:11-14----11 因为神救众人的恩典，已经显明出来， 12 教训我们除去不敬虔的心，和世俗的情欲，在今世自守，公义，敬虔度日。 13 等候所盼望的福，并等候至大的神，和（或作无和字）我们救主耶稣基督的荣耀显现。 14 他为我们舍了自己，要赎我们脱离一切罪恶，又洁净我们，特作自己的子民，热心为善。

1. God's grace in Jesus Christ not only saves us from sin, it also sanctifies us to live God-honoring lives of purity.

    主在耶稣基督里的恩典不仅救我们脱离罪，也使我们成圣过荣耀神的纯洁的生活。

2. The glorious Son of God became the Son of Man that we, the sons and daughters of men, might become the glorifying sons and daughters of God.

    上帝荣耀之子成为人子，因此我们这些人类的子女，也可能成为上帝荣耀的子女。

##### B. Jesus, the Vine, enables His disciples, the branches, to produce the good fruit of a godly life. 耶稣是葡萄树，使他的使徒，葡萄枝子，结出神圣生活的好果子。

John 15:1-5 - I am the true vine and My Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit He trims clean so that it will be even more fruitful. You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in Me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from Me you can do nothing.

约翰福音15:1-5----1 我是真葡萄树，我父是栽培的人。 2 凡属我不结果子的枝子，他就剪去。凡结果子的，他就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多。 3 现在你们因我讲给你们的道，已经干净了。 4 你们要常在我里面，我也常在你们里面。枝子若不常在葡萄树上，自己就不能结果子。你们若不常在我里面，也是这样。 5 我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面，这人就多结果子。因为离了我，你们就不能作什么。

1. Just as branches are always dependent on the vine for life and strength, so we are always dependent on Jesus, our Savior and Lord, for our spiritual life and strength.

    正如枝子永远要依靠葡萄树获取生命和力量，我们的灵性生命和力量也一直依靠耶稣，我们的救主。

2. Jesus enables us to bear godly fruit in our lives as a result of our believing union with Him.

    藉着我们相信与祂的合一，耶稣使我们在生命中能结神圣的果子。

##### C. God is faithful in keeping His promises to aid us in godly living our whole life long. 上帝是信实的，他信守承诺，帮助我们一生过神圣的生活。

1 Corinthians 1:8-9 - He (God) will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord is faithful.

哥林多前书1:8-9----8 他也必坚固你们到底，叫你们在我们主耶稣基督的日子，无可责备。 9 神是信实的，你们原是被他所召，好与他儿子，我们的主耶稣基督，一同得分。

1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 - May God Himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful and He will do it.

帖撒罗尼迦前书5:23-24----23 愿赐平安的神，亲自使你们全然成圣。又愿你们的灵，与魂，与身子，得蒙保守，在我主耶稣基督降临的时候，完全无可指摘。 24 那召你们的本是信实的，他必成就这事。

1. We can be confident that the God who started the gracious work of sanctifying us will complete it.

    我们能确信，神即在我们身上展开了这项满有恩典的工作就一定会完成它。

2. We can be sure that the grace of God will keep us wherever His will leads us.

    我们能确信无论神的旨意将我们带领到何处，祂的恩典都会保守我们。

#### III. Our Lord Leads Us To Make Progress In Living Holier Lives 我们的主带领我们在过更加圣洁的生活上取得进步
##### A. The Lord has made us spiritually new people who have holy desires. 我们的主使我们成为灵性上的新人，有着圣洁的愿望。

2 Corinthians 5:17-18a - Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ.

哥林多后书5:17-18a----17 若有人在基督里，他就是新造的人。旧事已过，都变成新的了。 18 一切都是出于神，他借着基督使我们与他和好，

1. John Newton, the write of the hymn, "Amazing Grace", made this comment on God grace at work in his life: "I am not what I ought to be. I am not what I wish to be. I am not what I hope to be. But, by the grace of God, I am not what I was."

    约翰·牛顿，赞美诗“奇异恩典”的作者，对神在他生命中的恩典作出如下评论：“我不是我应成为的人。我不是我期盼成为的人。我不是我希望成为的人。但是，因着上帝的恩典，我不再是过去的自己。”

    Psalm 40:8 - To do your will, O my God, is my desire; Your law is within my heart.

    诗篇40:8 我的神阿，我乐意照你的旨意行。你的律法在我心里。

    Psalm 119:104, 112 - I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path . . . My heart is set on keeping your decrees to the very end.

    诗篇119:104 我借着你的训词，得以明白。所以我恨一切的假道。

    诗篇119:112 我专心遵行你的律例，永不改变，遵行到底。

2. Through His Word and the work of the Holy Spirit, God works in us both a hatred of sin and a love for living according to His holy will. We realize that God's will is the great good we desire and that disobedience to His will is the great evil we abhor.

    通过他的话语及圣灵的工作，上帝通过他的圣洁旨意用对罪的恨恶和对生活的爱在我们里面作工。我们意识到神的旨意是我们想要极大的善，不遵行他的旨意是我们所恨恶的邪恶。

##### B. The Lord leads us to separate ourselves from people who are wicked influences. 我们的主带领我们从哪些有邪恶影响的人中分别出来。

1 Corinthians 15:33 - "Do not be misled: 'Bad company corrupts good character.'

哥林多前书15:33 你们不要自欺，“滥交朋友是会败坏品德的。”

Psalm 101:4, 7 - Men of perverse heart shall not be far from me: I will have nothing to do with evil . . . No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.

诗篇101:4 弯曲的心思，我必远离。一切的恶人（或作恶事），我不认识。

诗篇101:7 行诡诈的，必不得住在我家里。说谎话的，必不得立在我眼前。
1. God teaches us to recognize that some people are bad spiritual influences on us and that we must stay away from them and their wickedness so that it does not damage or destroy our faith in and love for God.

    上帝教导我们认出一些人对我们的灵性有坏的影响，我们必须远离他们和他们的邪恶，如此这恶才不能毁坏或摧毁我们对上帝的信仰和爱。

2. After his conversion to Christianity, Saint Augustine was approached by a woman with whom he had previously had a sinful sexual relationship. She tried to get him to return to his old sinful ways and said: "Augustine, It is I, your old friend." He refused her by replying: "But, it is no longer I, your old Augustine."

    在转信基督教后，一个与圣奥古斯丁有过罪恶性关系的妇人接近了他。她试图使他转回旧有的罪性道路上，并说：“奥古斯丁，是我，你的老朋友。”他用下面的回答拒绝了她：“但是，我已经不是我了，不是你以前的旧奥古斯丁了。”

##### C. The Lord leads us to stay away from and remove unwholesome influences in our lives.  我们的主带领我们远离并除去我们生命中有害的影响。

Psalm 119:10 - I have kept my feet from every evil path so that I may obey Your word.

诗篇119:10 我一心寻求了你。求你不要叫我偏离你的命令。

Psalm 101:3a - I will set before my eyes no vile thing.

诗篇101:3a 邪恶的事，我都不摆在眼前。

Acts 19:18-19 - Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practiced open sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. (A drachma was about a day's wage.)

使徒行传19:18-19----18 那已经信的，多有人来承认诉说自己所行的事。 19 平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书价，便知道共合五万块钱。

1. John Newton's life rule: "I make it a rule of Christian duty never to go to a place where there is not room for my Master as well as myself."

    约翰·牛顿的人生法则：“我把这个基督徒职责作为一个准则：从不去那些没有为我主和我自己留有空间的地方。”

2. A young man, living away from home while attending college, received a package from his mother that contained a beautiful portrait of Jesus Christ. The young man hung the portrait on his dormitory wall.
