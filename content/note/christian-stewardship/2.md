#### LIFE WITH OUR LORD 与主同活

##### Fighting The Battle For Life 为生活而战

Goal: To understand more clearly and to fight more successfully the great spiritual battle to preserve our faith and to grow in our steward-disciple life with our Lord Jesus.

目标：更清楚的明白并且更成功的打灵里的争战，从而保守我们的信心并且在我们与主同活的生命中成长。

Prayer: Dear Jesus, our merciful and mighty Lord, we ask Your blessing on our study of Your Word. Make us more aware of the great battle for spiritual life that we must fight against very deadly enemies. Impress on us Your great conquest of our enemies and the divine help You give us. Enable us to fight wisely and well with the power You provide so that we may share in Your eternal victory. On the basis of Your all-sufficient saving work we ask this. Amen.

祷告：亲爱的耶稣，我们满有恩典和大能的主，我们求你祝福我们对你话语的学习。求你使我们意识到我们必须与那危险的敌人打那灵里的争战。求你使我们深深知道你已经胜过了我们的敌人并且你将赐给我们从神而来的能力。求你帮助我们藉着你赐的能力满有智慧的打那美好的仗，好使我们可以分享你那永恒的得胜。藉着你全备的救赎之功我们如此祈求。阿门。

#### I. Our Life With The Lord Jesus Is Under Attack 我们同主耶稣的生活会遭受攻击

##### A. The Steward-Disciples Of Jesus Christ Are Involved In An Ongoing Spiritual War 耶稣基督的管家-仆人正在一场进行中的属灵争战里

Romans 5:1 - Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

罗马书5:1 - 我们既因信称义，就借着我们的主耶稣基督得与　神相和。

1 Timothy 6:12a - Fight the good fight of faith.

提摩太前书6:12a - 你要为真道打那美好的仗。

1. While the Lord's steward-disciples enjoy a most wonderful peace with God, they find themselves involved in a bitter fight to retain their faith and to progress in their spiritual life as Christ's believing servants.

    做主的管家仆人得享从神而来的平安的同时，也会发现他们正处于一场艰苦的争战来竭力持守他们的信心，并且做为基督忠信的仆人在他们的属灵生活中渐渐成长。

    Ephesians 6:12 - For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

    以弗所书6:12 - 因我们并不是与属血气的争战，乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。

2. The battle is not a battle against mere human opponents. The Lord's steward-disciples find themselves fighting against the powerful, supernatural forces of evil.

    这场争战的对手并不是人。主的管家-仆人要意识到他们是与强大的、灵里的魔鬼的权势争战。

##### B. We Face Powerful Enemies With Deadly Designs 我们面对的是强大的恩典和致死的阴谋

1. The Devil or Satan
    
    魔鬼或撒旦

    Revelation 12:9 - The great dragon was hurled down - that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.

    启示录12:9大龙就是那古蛇，名叫魔鬼，又叫撒但，是迷惑普天下的。它被摔在地上，它的使者也一同被摔下去。

    1 Peter 5:8 - Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

    彼得前书5:8- 务要谨守，警醒。因为你们的仇敌魔鬼，如同吼叫的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人。

    2 Corinthians 11:3 - But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

    哥林多后书11:3 - 我只怕你们的心或偏于邪，失去那向基督所存纯一清洁的心，就像蛇用诡诈诱惑了夏娃一样。

    a. The Devil, the great deceiver and enemy of God, is a personal enemy of all people, especially of believers in Jesus Christ.

    魔鬼就是最大的欺骗者和神的敌人，是所有人的敌人，特别是那些在耶稣基督里的人的敌人。

    b. The Devil works tirelessly to draw people away from their allegiance to the Lord Jesus and into a state of unbelief and spiritual death.

    魔鬼不知疲倦的把人从忠心顺服主拉向不信和灵里死亡的境地。

2. The Sinful World (in the sense of all people, items, ideas, beliefs, and other things, which Satan uses to oppose God's will and to harm the spiritual life of people)

    罪恶的世界（意指所有的人，事物，思想，信念和其他所有被撒旦用以抵挡神的旨意和伤害人属灵生命的事物）

    1 John 2:15-16 - Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world - the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes, and the boasting of what he has and does - comes not from the Father, but from the world.

    约翰一书2:15-16----15 不要爱世界和世界上的事。人若爱世界，爱父的心就不在他里面了。16 因为，凡世界上的事，就像肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲，并今生的骄傲，都不是从父来的，乃是从世界来的。

    James 4:4 - You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

    雅各书4:4 你们这些淫乱的人哪，岂不知与世俗为友就是与　神为敌吗？所以凡想要与世俗为友的，就是与　神为敌了。

    a. "Anything that cools my love for Christ is the world." (John Wesley)

    “任何减少我对基督的爱的事物就是世界”（约翰卫斯理）

    b. The sinful world is the willing ally of the devil, who is the false 'god of this world.'

    罪恶的世界是魔鬼所乐意的盟友，魔鬼是虚假的“世界的王”。

    c. The sinful world is also hard at work to destroy our allegiance to Jesus either by trying to draw us away from Him or to force us away from Him.

    罪恶的世界也竭力做工要破坏我们 对耶稣的顺服，它或是要把我们从耶稣身边拉开 或是迫使我们远离耶稣。

    Colossians 2:8 - See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.

    歌罗西书2:8 你们要谨慎，恐怕有人用他的理学和虚空的妄言，不照着基督，乃照人间的遗传和世上的小学就把你们掳去。

    d. The sinful world employs "Trojan-horse" tactics to enslave people to its power. In appealing and deceptive ways, it leads people to base their lives on something else than the sure foundation of the Lord Jesus Christ and His Word.

    罪恶的世界采取“特洛伊木马”的策略来奴役人在它的权柄下。藉着吸引人和欺骗的手段，它使人把生命建立其它的事物上而不是在主耶稣和祂的道这真实的基础之上。

3. Our Sinful Nature

    我们的罪性

    Galatians 5:16-21 - So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy drunkenness, orgies and the life. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.

    加拉太书5:16-21----6 我说，你们当顺着圣灵而行，就不放纵肉体的情欲了。17 因为情欲和圣灵相争，圣灵和情欲相争，这两个是彼此相敌，使你们不能做所愿意做的。18 但你们若被圣灵引导，就不在律法以下。19 情欲的事都是显而易见的，就如奸淫、污秽、邪荡、20 拜偶像、邪术、仇恨、争竞、忌恨、恼怒、结党、纷争、异端、21 嫉妒、醉酒、荒宴等类。我从前告诉你们，现在又告诉你们，行这样事的人必不能承受　神的国。

    Romans 8:6-8, 13a - The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace, because the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. . . For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die.

    罗马书8:6-8, 13a----6 体贴肉体的，就是死；体贴圣灵的，乃是生命、平安。7 原来体贴肉体的，就是与　神为仇；因为不服　神的律法，也是不能服，8 而且属肉体的人不能得　神的喜欢。

    罗马书8:13a 你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；

    a. Our sinful nature is that part of us which disbelieves and defies God and His will. It, too, is a willing ally of Satan.

    我们的罪性就是我们生命中不信神反抗神和祂旨意的部分。这也是撒旦所乐意的盟友。

    b. The sinful nature fiercely fights against our Spirit-created and Spirit-directed believing nature, which trusts, loves and obeys God perfectly.

    罪性拼命的抵挡我们从灵生的蒙圣灵指引的性情，从灵生的性情信靠，热爱并完全的听从神。

    c. The sinful nature strives to destroy us by leading us into sin, unbelief and spiritual death.

    罪性努力要藉着引领我们犯罪，不信和灵里的死亡来毁坏我们。

    d. The sinful nature is a vicious enemy inside us, which works to betray and defeat us from within.

    罪性是在我们里面罪恶的敌人，它在我们里面做工要背叛打垮我们。

##### C. Temptations 试探

Matthew 18:7a - Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come.

马太福音18:7a - 这世界有祸了，因为将人绊倒；绊倒人的事是免不了的

1. Temptations are a reality for us. Every living person encounters efforts to lead them to sin against God.

    试探对我们来说是真实存在的。每个活着的人都会遭遇那些会导致他们得罪神的事。

2. "The human race began in a garden - a wonderful garden in which there was only one forbidden fruit. Because we fell victim to a single prohibition, we must now walk through a world which hangs heavy with forbidden fruit. And our forward progress is unceasingly impeded by an ever increasing crop of enticing fruit trees loaded with spiritual poison."

    “人类开始于花园中，那是一个极为美好的园子，在那里只有一个被禁止吃的果树。因着我们在这唯一的禁令上的失败，我们现在必须行在这个满是禁果的世界上。并且我们前行的路程不断的被那些不断增长的作物所阻挡，这些作物上挂满了诱人的属灵毒药。”

    2 Corinthians 11:14-15a - And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.

    哥林多后书11:14-15a----14这也不足为怪，因为连撒但也装作光明的天使。15所以他的差役，若装作仁义的差役，也不算希奇。

    Hebrews 11:25 - He (Moses) chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.

    希伯来书11:25 他(摩西)宁可和　神的百姓同受苦害，也不愿暂时享受罪中之乐。

3. Our spiritual enemies make temptations attractive to us - things that bring pleasure and satisfaction. These temptations appear to be harmless and innocent. They may even seem to be things that are good and serve our best interests.

    我们灵里的敌人常用试探吸引我们 - 就是那些会带来愉悦和满足的事。这些试探看起来像是无害、清白的。甚至他们还可能看起来像是一些美好的能满足我们需要的事。

4. In fact, these spiritual deceptions are dangerous and deadly.

    事实上，这些灵里的欺骗是危险和致命的。

    Matthew 13:20-22 - The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.

    马太福音13:20-22----20 撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，当下欢喜领受，21 只 因心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了。22 撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有世上的思虑、钱财的迷惑把道挤住了，不能结实。

5. In this section of the Parable of the Four Soils, Jesus points out that temptations come in various forms through the different circumstances of a person's life. Hardships, concerns of daily life, prosperity are all occasions for temptations to come to people.

    在本节四个撒种的比喻中，耶稣指出试探会以何种形式，藉着人生命中的各种环境来临。艰难，对日常生活的挂虑，财富都是试探临到人的机会。

    James 1:13-15 - When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by His own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown gives birth to death.

    雅各书1:13-15----13人被试探，不可说：「我是被　神试探」；因为　神不能被 恶试探，他也不试探人。14但各人被试探，乃是被自己的私欲牵引诱惑的。15私欲既怀了胎，就生出罪来；罪既长成，就生出死来。

6. God does not tempt people to sin. That is the work of the steward-disciple's spiritual enemies.

    神不试探人犯罪。这是管家-仆人灵里的敌人所做的工作。

7. Each person is responsible for how he/she handles the temptations he/she encounters.

    每一个人都有要对他/她如何处理他/她所面对的试探负责。

8. God warns that temptations that go unopposed and are not overcome by resistance or by repentance will result in spiritual death.

    神警告我们如若是试探畅通无阻并且不藉着抵抗和悔改胜过的话将面临灵里的死亡。

    James 1:2-4, 12 - Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. . . Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.

    雅各书1:2-4----2 我的弟兄们，你们落在百般试炼中，都要以为大喜乐；3 因 为知道你们的信心经过试验，就生忍耐。4 也当成功，使你们成全、完备，毫无缺欠。

    雅各书1:12 受试探的人是有福的，因为他经过试验以后，必得生命的冠冕；这是主应许给那些爱他之人的。

9. God has a purpose in permitting us to be tempted. He desires that temptation help develop our spiritual perseverance, an essential component for our growth and maturity as His stewards and disciples.

    神准许我们被试探是含有深意的。祂愿这试探帮助我们培养我们灵里的坚忍，这对于我们做祂管家和仆人的成长和成熟来说是至关重要的部分。

10. American president, John Quincy Adams, commented on the value of temptations in this way: "Every temptation is an opportunity for us to get closer to God."

    美国总统，约翰·昆西·亚当斯，这样评价试探的价值：“每一次试探都是我们更亲近神的机会”

11. Dr. Martin Luther said to temptation's benefits: "If I live longer, I certainly want to write a book on temptations, for without these a person cannot appreciate Holy Scripture, faith, or the fear and love of God. The person who has never been in temptations cannot know what it means to have hope."

    马丁路德博士说过试探的益处：“如果我活得长些，我肯定想写一部关于试探的书，因为若没有试探人就不能对圣经，信心或是对神的惧怕和爱心存感激。一个从未受试探的人不能知道心存盼望的意义。”

#### II. Our Spiritual Enemies Are Able To Make Alarming Gains That Weaken And Harm Us 我们灵里的敌人确能得逞使我们软弱和伤害我们。

The Devil, the sinful world, and our sinful nature are a powerful team. They are capable of causing great spiritual damage to the lives of steward-disciples. Consider some of the following "successes" they have achieved among those who carry the name "Christian."

魔鬼，罪恶的世界和我们的罪性是一个强有力的组合。他们能够对管家-仆人的生活造成巨大灵里伤害。思考下述的他们在那些所谓的“基督徒”身上的“成功”之作。

A. A low level of commitment to Jesus Christ (Example: Being willing to enjoy the blessings Jesus offers, but not being willing to live according to His Word) 

低程度的对耶稣基督的委身（例如：愿意享受耶稣所赐的祝福，却不愿意按照祂的话语而行）

B. A low level of commitment to the Christian Church (Example: belonging to a church, but only attending worship occasionally and supporting it with offerings or service sporadically) 

低程度的对基督教会的委身（例如：属于一间教会，但仅偶尔参加聚会并且零星的参与服事和奉献）

C. A failure to share the Gospel with others (Example: Not bothering to invite others to learn God's Word, No great concern for the spiritual and eternal welfare of others.)

缺乏与人分享福音（例如：不愿意邀请别人来学习神的话语，不关心别人灵里的需要和永生里的福祉）

D. A distaste for God's Word (Example: Low percentages and number of church members attending Bible classes and conducting personal or family devotions)

厌恶神的话语（例如：教会中的会友中仅有少数人参加圣经学习和带领个人或家庭灵修）

E. Doctrinal laxity and compromise (Examples: Treating false teachings as matters of minor concern, expressing fellowship without clear and full agreement in matters of faith)

对教义的疏忽和妥协（例如：把错误地教导视为小问题，在对信仰问题不一致和不清楚的情形下轻易的团契相交）

F. A lack of spiritual discernment (Example: An inability to recognize false teachings and unbiblical practices)

缺乏灵里的分辨（不能够认出错误的教导和不符合圣经的行为）

G. A belief in "no-fault" forgiveness (Example: Insisting that God forgives sins to a person even though that person is unrepentant and continues in his/her sinful ways)

相信“无过错责任”的赦免（例如：坚持认为即便人不悔改并且不断犯罪，神也会赦免人的罪）

H. Universalism - "God will take everyone to heaven" (Example: Contending that God is too loving to send anyone to hell and that He will spare all people or the "sincere" people apart from faith in Jesus Christ)

普救论 - “神会救所有的人进天堂”（例如：主张神爱世人以至于绝不会让任何人下地狱并且祂将容忍所有人或那些“真诚的”人不需要相信耶稣基督）

I. A low sense of personal esteem (Example: Failing to appreciate the great sense of worth we have as objects of God's creative and redeeming work)

不自尊（例如：没有认识到我们因着是神的造物和救赎的工作而有的价值）

J. A failure to disciple openly unrepentant church members (Example: Tolerating openly sinful actions of a person who shows no signs of sorrow or regret without caring to confront the person committing them)

不能责备公开不悔改的教会会友（例如：容忍公开犯罪、毫不懊悔或后悔的人，不去对付这样做的人）

K. An insensitivity to sin in one's own life (Failing to combat sin's working in and through us)

对人自己生活中的罪毫无感觉（对于在我们身上的罪或藉着我们而行的罪，我们都不与之争战）

#### III. Our Lord Aids Us In The Battle For Life 为生活中的争战里，我们的主帮助我们

##### A. The Lord Jesus Is Our Champion. He Has Defeated Our Spiritual Enemies And Frees Us From Their Control Over Our Lives. 主耶稣是我们的冠军。祂已经击败了我们灵里的敌人并把我们从它们对我们生活的辖制中解放出来。

Hebrews 2:14-15, 17-18 - Since the children have flesh and blood, He (Jesus) too shared in their humanity so that by His death, He might destroy Him who holds the power of death - that is, the devil - and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. . . For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way, in order that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that He might make atonement for the sins of the people. 18) Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.

希伯来书2:14-15----14儿女既同有血肉之体，他（耶稣）也照样亲自成了血肉之体，特要借着死败坏那掌死权的，就是魔鬼，15并要释放那些一生因怕死而为奴仆的人。

希伯来书2:17-18----17 所以，他凡事该与他的弟兄相同，为要在　神的事上成为慈悲忠信的大祭司，为百姓的罪献上挽回祭。18他自己既然被试探而受苦，就能搭救被试探的人。

2 Thessalonians 3:3 - But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.

帖撒罗尼迦后书3:3 - 但主是信实的，要坚固你们，保护你们脱离那恶者。

1. Our Lord has defeated the devil for us and shields us in our battle against him.

    我们的主已经为我们击败了魔鬼并在我们与它的征战中保护我们。

    a. Our Lord's victory means that the devil is no longer able to successfully accuse us of sin and have us condemned to hell.

    我们主的得胜意味着魔鬼不再能成功的控告我们的罪并咒诅我们下地狱。

    b. Our Lord's victory means that the devil can be thwarted in his attempts to lead us into sin.

    我们主的得胜意味着在魔鬼想要带领我们犯罪的尝试可以被挫败。

    John 16:33b - In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.

    约翰福音16:33b - 在世上，你们有苦难；但你们可以放心，我已经胜了世界。

    Galatians 6:14 - May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to Me, and I to the world.

    加拉太书6:14 - 但我断不以别的夸口，只夸我们主耶稣基督的十字架；因这十字架，就我而论，世界已经钉在十字架上；就世界而论，我已经钉在十字架上。

    1 John 5:5 - Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.

    约翰一书5:5 - 胜过世界的是谁呢？不是那信耶稣是　神儿子的吗？

2. Our Lord has overcome the world and permits us to overcome it as well.

    我们的主也胜过了世界并使我们也能胜过世界

    a. Our Lord's victory means that we progressively fall out of love with the attractions of the sinful world apart from God.

    我们主的得胜意味着我们正渐渐的不再爱慕罪恶世界中远离神的诱惑。

    b. Our Lord's victory means that we have power to resist the captivating forces of the sinful world.

    我们主的得胜意味着我们有能力来抵抗来自罪恶世界中的诱惑力量。

    Romans 6:6 - For we know that our old self was crucified with Him (Jesus) so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.

    罗马书6:6 - 因为知道我们的旧人和他同钉十字架，使罪身灭绝，叫我们不再作罪 的奴仆.

    Romans 8:1-4 - Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so He condemned sin in sinful man, in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.

    罗马书8:1-4----1 如今，那些在基督耶稣里的就不定罪了。2 因为赐生命圣灵的律，在基督耶稣里释放了我，使我脱离罪和死的律了。3 律法既因肉体软弱，有所不能行的，　神就差遣自己的儿子，成为罪身的形状，作了赎罪祭，在肉体中定了罪案，4 使律法的义成就在我们这不随从肉体、只随从圣灵的人身上。

3. Our Lord has defeated the power of sin and has set us free from bondage to it.

    我们的主已经击败的罪的权势并且把我们从它的捆绑之下解救出来。

    a. Our Lord's victory means that we are now free from the condemning power of sin and our sinful nature.

    我们主的得胜意味着我们现在不在罪和我们罪性的咒诅能力之下了。

    b. Our Lord's victory means that we are also free from the controlling power of sin and our sinful nature. We are no longer bound to serve it.

    我们主的得胜意味着我们也从罪和我们罪性的掌控之下被解救出来了。我们不再被捆绑来服事它。

##### B. Our Lord Provides Spiritual Cleansing From Our Sins Through His Perfect, Once-For-All Sacrifice. 我们的主藉着祂完全一次的牺牲来帮助我们在灵里洁净我们的罪。

Hebrews 9:26b, 14 - But now He (Jesus) has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself. . . How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God.

希伯来书9:26b 但如今在这末世显现一次，把自己献为祭，好除掉罪。

希伯来书9:14 何况基督借着永远的灵，将自己无瑕无疵献给　神，他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心，除去你们的死行，使你们事奉那永生　神吗？

##### C. Our Lord Provides Us With An Example Of Perseverance Which We Are To Follow 我们的主给我们做了坚忍的榜样，是我们所当效法的

Hebrews 12:1-3 - Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

希伯来书12:1-3----1我们既有这许多的见证人，如同云彩围着我们，就当放下各样的重担，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程，2仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在　神宝座的右边。3那忍受罪人这样顶撞的，你们要思想，免得疲倦灰心。

##### D. Our Lord Limits The Ability Of Our Spiritual Enemies To Tempt Us And Provides Us With A Way To Endure Each Temptation 我们的主限制我们灵里的敌人试探我们的能力并为我们每一次忍受试探都开了一条出路。

1 Corinthians 10:13b - And God is faithful, He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.

哥林多前书10:13b - 神是信实的，必不叫你们受试探过于所能受的；在受试探的时候，总要给你们开一条出路，叫你们能忍受得住。

1. God keeps our spiritual enemies on a leash. They can go only so far in their efforts to harm us.

    神使我们灵里的敌人尽在祂的掌控之中。它们只能够仅仅的伤害我们。

2. Consider the small boy in a store who is being given boxes to hold by a man up on a ladder. When questioned by a customer if the man was putting too much into his arms, the boy replied, "My father knows how much I can carry."

    试想有一个在商店中的小男孩拿着一个站在梯子上的大人给他的箱子。有一个顾客问他那个大人放在他手里的东西是不是过于沉重了。这个男孩回答说“我父亲知道我能拿多重的东西”

##### E. Our Lord Provides Us With Spiritual Armor, With Which We Can Successfully Resist Our Enemies 我们的主为我们提供属灵军装，藉此我们可以成功的抵挡我们的敌人

Ephesians 6:13-18 - Therefore, put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.

1 Corinthians 9:24-27 - Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize! Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

哥林多前书9:24-27----24岂不知在场上赛跑的都跑，但得奖赏的只有一人？你们也当这样跑，好叫你们得着奖赏。25凡较力争胜的，诸事都有节制，他们不过是要得能坏的冠冕；我们却是要得不能坏的冠冕。26所以，我奔跑不像无定向的；我斗拳不像打空气的。27我是攻克己身，叫身服我，恐怕我传福音给别人，自己反被弃绝了。

In addition to this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.

以弗所书6:13-18----13 所以，要拿起　神所赐的全副军装，好在磨难的日子抵挡仇敌，并且成就了一切，还能站立得住。14 所以要站稳了，用真理当作带子束腰，用公义当作护心镜遮胸，15 又用平安的福音当作预备走路的鞋穿在脚上。16 此外，又拿着信德当作盾牌，可以灭尽那恶者一切的火箭；17 并戴上救恩的头盔，拿着圣灵的宝剑，就是　神的道；18靠着圣灵，随时多方祷告祈求；并要在此警醒不倦，为众圣徒祈求，

1. Use God's Word to help you fight temptations.

    使用神的话语来帮助你与试探争战。

2. "Once we lose sight of the Word, the ways and means of help are no more. I say this as one who has himself found it to be so. I have suffered various and many temptations, and they were very grievous. But as soon as I laid hold of some saying of Scripture and relied on it as a holy anchor, the temptations were driven away - temptations which I should not have been able to bear, much less overcome, for even a short time without the Word." (Dr. Martin Luther)

    当我们不瞩目神的话语时，帮助的途径就没有了。我这样说是以一个过来人的经历说的。我经过了很多各种试探，那都是非常剧烈的。但只要我一旦抓住一些经文并紧紧的依赖在上面，好像一个神圣的锚。试探就被赶跑了——这些试探是我不能够承担的，即便是在短暂的一刻失去了神的话语，都无法胜过。（马丁路德博士）

3. Use prayer to help you fight temptations.

    使用祷告来帮助你与试探争战。
4. "Christ, who was tempted in our flesh, is the best intercessor before God in all temptations." (Dr. Martin Luther)

##### G. Practice Ongoing Repentance (Confessing Your Sins And Being Assured Of Our Lord's Continued Pardon For Them) 操练持续的悔改（承认你的罪并得确保我们的主不断的赦免我们的罪）

1 John 1:8-2:2 - If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar and His word has no place in our lives. My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense - Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not only for ours, but also for the sins of the whole world.

约翰一书1:8-2:2----8 我们若说自己无罪，便是自欺，真理不在我们心里了。9 我 们若认自己的罪， 神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪，洗净我们一切的不义。10我们若说自己没有犯过罪，便是以　神为说谎的，他的道也不在我们心里了。1我小子们哪，我将这些话写给你们，是要叫你们不犯罪。若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督。2他为我们的罪作了挽回祭，不是单为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪。

1. The Lord's followers will still sin in spite of their great struggle not to. The sinful nature of Christians will, at times, break through and lead believers to sin. This reality greatly distresses the steward-disciples of Jesus.

    主的跟随者尽管他们努力不情愿但仍会犯罪。基督徒的罪性将会，时时的，显露出来使得信徒犯罪。这个事实使耶稣的管家-仆人深深的为之苦恼。

2. When this happens, God points us to the practice of daily repentance. By confessing our sins and clinging to God's promise of forgiveness in Jesus, God allows us to find spiritual cleansing for our sin-troubled soul and divine comfort for our guilty conscience.

    当这样的事发生的时候，神向我们指出要操练天天的悔改。藉着承认我们的罪和仰赖神在耶稣里赦罪的应许，神许可我们在为罪所困扰的生命之中找到灵里的清洁，并且内疚的良心可得从神而来的安慰。

3. The practice of ongoing repentance is like breathing for our soul. As we confess our sins, we expel the bad and deadly things and as we claim God's pardon, we take in the good, life-giving things into our system.

    操练持续的悔改好像我们生命中的呼吸，当我们承认自己罪的时候，我们排出败坏、致死之物，当我们呼求神的赦免之时，我们得到美好，赐生命的之物在我们里面。

##### H. Look Forward To The Lord's Eternal Blessing On Those Who Fight The Battle For Life Successfully 盼望主永生的赐福给予那些为生命打美好的仗的人。

2 Timothy 4:7-8 - I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day - and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.

提摩太后书4:7-8----7那美好的仗我已经打过了，当跑的路我已经跑尽了，所信的道我已经守住了。8从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按着公义审判的主到了那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。
