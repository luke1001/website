下面是几种简明的方法，你会发现用于分享基础基督教信息，引领他人相信他们的救主方面很有帮助。

#### The Simple Truth 简单真理

1. God Has Every Reason To Be Angry With You

    上帝有千万种理由向你发怒

    Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. (Matthew 5:48)

    所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。（马太福音5:48）

    All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)

    因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。（罗马书3:23）

    The wages of sin is death. (Romans 6:23a)

    因为罪的工价乃是死。（罗马书6:23a）

2. God Still Loves You Enough To Make You His Friend

    上帝依然爱你，使你做他的朋友

    For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)

    神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音3:16）

    The blood of Jesus, God's Son, purifies us from every sin. (1 John 1:7)

    他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。（约翰一书1:7）

    While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)

    惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死。（罗马书5:8）

3. Your Sins Are Forgiven! It Is God's Gift To You! Believe It!

    你罪已得赦免！这是上帝给你的恩赐！相信它！

    The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23b)

    惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。（罗马书6:23b）

    Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved. (Acts 16:31)

    当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。（使徒行传16:31）

4. Thank God For His Precious Gift With A Life Of Love

    用爱的生命感谢上帝赐给你的珍贵礼物

    This is love; not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. (1 John 4:10-11)

    不是我们爱神，乃是神爱我们，差他的儿子为我们的罪作了挽回祭，这就是爱了。亲爱的弟兄啊，神既是这样爱我们，我们也当彼此相爱。（约翰一书4:10-11）

    I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer yourselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God - which is your spiritual worship. (Romans 12:1)

    所以弟兄们，我以神的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上，当作活祭，是圣洁的，是神所喜悦的，你们如此侍奉，乃是理所当然的。（罗马书12:1）

#### God's Good News For You 上帝给你的好消息

1. God Has A Wonderful Gift For You

    上帝为你预备了美妙非凡的礼物

    Heaven or eternal life is a free gift from God that no one can earn or deserves.

    天堂或永生是来自上帝的免费礼物，没人能赢得或值得拥有这份礼物。

    People may say:

    人们可能会说：

    "Free? There is no such thing. Everything else I get I have to work for."

    “免费？根本没有这样的东西。我得到的每件东西都需要付出劳动。”

    "I always thought that God expected us to work or to do good to get to heaven."

    “我一直以为上帝希望我们做工或通过好行为来上天堂。”

    The truth is: Eternal life is free with no conditions attached to it. There is nothing you or I have to do - or can do - to earn it.

    事实是：永生是免费的，其上没有附加任何条件。你我并没有必须做的或能做的去赢得它。

    God says:

    上帝说：

    The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus, our Lord (Romans 6:23b)

    惟有神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。（罗马书6:23b）

    For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

    你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是神所赐的；也不是出于行为，免得有人自夸。（以弗所书2:8-9）

2. We Have A Major Problem, Our Sin

    我们有个主要问题，就是我们的罪

    If we wanted to meet God's standard for earning eternal life, we would have to be perfect. But none of us are. In fact, we are all sinners who have done many wrong things against God that deserve His punishment instead of His reward.

    如果我们为了赢得永生而去达到上帝的标准，我们就必须是完美的。但没人是完美的。事实上，我们都是罪人，做了很多违背主的错事，应受他的惩罚，而不是奖赏。

    People may say:

    人们可能会说：

    "Are you saying that I will never make it to heaven by my own efforts?"

    “你是说我从来不需要为上天堂而努力？”

    "I cannot possibly live a perfect life!"

    “我不可能过完美的生活！”

    The truth is: We are all imperfect, and because of our sin, we all deserve hell.

    事实是：我们都是不完美的，因为我们的罪，我们都该下地狱。

    God says:

    上帝说：

    Be perfect, therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect. (Matthew5:48)

    所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。（马太福音5:48）

    For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23a)

    因为世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。（罗马书3:23）

    For the wages of sin is death. (Romans 6:23a)

    因为罪的工价乃是死。（罗马书6:23a）

    How will you escape being condemned to hell? (Matthew 23:33b)

    怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？（马太福音23:33b）

3. God Is Just, But Also Merciful

    上帝是公义的，也是仁慈的

    God is a holy and just God, who must punish us for our sin, but He is also a loving and merciful God who wants all people to have eternal life.

    上帝是圣洁公义的，他必须因我们的罪惩罚我们，但他也是慈爱仁慈的神，他想要所有人都得永生。

    People may say:

    人们可能会说：

    "I have a difficult time understanding how the God who condemns us can also be the one who saves us?"

    “我很难理解责罚我们的上帝同时也可以是拯救我们的神。”

    "Are you telling me that God is right when He condemns us, but that He gets no joy out of seeing people go to hell?

    “你是在告诉我当上帝责罚我们时，他是对的，但是看着人们下地狱他并不能得到喜悦？”

    The truth is: God loves us and want us to have eternal life, but He is also just and cannot simply ignore our sins. God is deeply concerned about our bad situation.

    事实是：上帝爱我们，愿意我们得永生，但是他是公义的，不能简单地忽视我们的罪。上帝非常关心我们的糟糕境况。

    God says:

    上帝说：

    He does not leave the guilty unpunished. (Exodus 34:7b)

    必追讨他的罪。（出埃及记34:7b）

    God wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. (1 Timothy 2:4)

    他愿意万人得救，明白真道。（提摩太前书2:4）

    For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live! (Ezekiel 18:32)

    主耶和华说：我不喜悦那死人之死，所以你们当回头而存活。（以西结书18:32）

4. Jesus Christ Has Paid For Our Sins And Gained Eternal Life For Us

    耶稣基督已经赎了我们一切的罪并为我们获得永生

    Out of His great love, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, into the world and punished Him for our sins so that we might have forgiveness and eternal life.

    因着他的大爱，上帝赐下他的儿子耶稣基督到这个世界，并为我们的罪惩罚他，以此让我们能被宽恕并得永生。

    People may say:

    人们可能会说：

    "How could God possibly think of sacrificing His own perfect, precious Son for me?"

    “上帝怎么可能会想为我们牺牲他自己完美宝贵的儿子？”

    "Do you mean that Jesus Christ did these humanly impossible things for me?"

    “你的意思是耶稣基督为了我们做这些人类不可能做到的事情？”

    The truth is: When Jesus lived His holy life and died on the cross, He paid for the sins of everyone, including you.

    事实是：当耶稣基督过了圣洁的一生并死在十字架上，他赎了每个人的罪，包括你的。

    God says:

    上帝说：

    The Lord has laid on Him (Jesus) the iniquity of us all. (Isaiah 53:6b)

    耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。（以赛亚书53:6b）

    He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. (1 John 2:2)

    他为我们的罪作了挽回祭，不是单为我们的罪，也是为普天下人的罪。（约翰一书2:2）

    The blood of Jesus, His Son, purifies us from all sin. (1 John 1:7b)

    他儿子耶稣的血也洗净我们一切的罪。（约翰一书1:7b）

5. God Invites Us To Believe In Jesus And Have Eternal Life

    上帝邀请我们相信耶稣并得永生

    God invites us to believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior so that we enjoy His pardoning love and eternal life. We can trust His reliable promise.

    上帝邀请我们相信耶稣基督作为我们的救主，因此我们能享有他赦免的爱和永生。我们能相信他可靠的承诺。

    People may say:

    人们可能会说：

    "God actually wants me to enjoy these rich gifts of pardon for my sins and heaven with Him?"

    “上帝实际上是想让我享受诸如宽恕我的罪、与他同在天国这些丰盛的礼物？”

    "This promise of forgiveness and eternal life through Jesus seems too good to possibly be true?"

    “这种通过主耶稣得赦免和永生的承诺看起来好的有点不真实。”

    The Truth is: God freely gives us His gifts of pardon and eternal life to us through Jesus Christ and what He has done for us. We can trust God to keep His promise.

    事实是：上帝通过耶稣白白地赐我们赦罪和永生的礼物以及所有他为我们所做的。我们要相信上帝会信守承诺。

    God says:

    上帝说：

    Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved - you and your household. (Acts 16:31)

    当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。（使徒行传16:31）

    For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)

    神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音3:16）

    A faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time. (Titus 1:2)

    盼望那无谎言的神在万古之先所应许的永生。（提多书1:2）

2. We are imperfect people who have done many wrong things. Our sins against God and others bring us serious consequences. How do our sins effect our relationship with God and His treatment of us?

    我们并不完美，做了很多错事。我们违背神的罪及其他的罪给我们带来严重后果。我们的罪是如何影响我们与神的关系和他如何对待我们的？

    a. Isaiah 59:2 - But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.

    a. 以赛亚书59:2 但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝。你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。

    a. Isaiah 53:3-5 - He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hid their faces He was despised and we esteemed Him not. Surely He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered Him stricken by God, smitten by Him and afflicted. But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed.

    a. 以赛亚书53:3-5 他被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患。他被藐视，好像被人掩面不看的一样；我们也不尊重他。他诚然担当我们的忧患，背负我们的痛苦；我们却以为他受责罚，被神击打苦待了。哪知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚，我们得平安；因他受的鞭伤，我们得医治。

    b. John 3:16-17 - For God so love the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.

    b. 约翰福音3:16-17 神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。因为神差他的儿子降世，不是要定世人的罪，乃是要叫世人因他得救。

6. What gives us the confidence that we have eternal life?


    是什么给了我们永生的信心？

    a. 1 John 5:11-13 - And this is the testimony God has given us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.

    a. 约翰一书5:11-13 这见证就是神赐给我们永生，这永生也是在他儿子里面。人有的神的儿子就有生命；没有神的儿子就没有生命。我将这些话写给你们信奉神儿子之名的人，要叫你们知道自己有永生。

    b. 2 Timothy 3:14-15 - But as for you continue in what you have learned and become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ?

    对那些信他作救主的人来说，耶稣基督说了哪些确信的美妙话语？

    a. John 10:27-30 - My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand. I and the Father are one.

    a. 约翰福音10:27-30 我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我；我又赐给他们永生，他们永不灭亡，谁也不能从我手里把他们夺去。我父把羊赐给我，他比万有都大，谁也不能从我父手里把他们夺去。我与父原为一。

    b. Romans 8:38-39 - For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

    b. 罗马书8:38-39 因为我深信无论是死、是生、是天使、是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。

9. What do those who trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior become?

    那些信奉耶稣基督为救主的人会成为什么？

    a. John 1:12 - Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.

    a. 约翰福音1:12 凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。

    b. Romans 8:17 - Now if we are children, the we are heirs - heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may share in His glory.

    b. 罗马书8：17 既是儿女，便是后嗣，就是神的后嗣，和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦，也必和他一同得荣耀。

10. God wants us to always have and never lose the eternal life we posses through faith in Jesus Christ. What encouragement and instruction does He give us so that we will always keep this great gift and blessing?

    上帝愿意我们永远拥有、永不失去因我们信奉耶稣基督所得的永生。因着上帝给予我们的哪些激励和指引，我们能永远存留这样好的恩赐和祝福？

    a. 1 John 2:24-25 - See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is what He promised us - even eternal life.

    a. 约翰一书2:24-25 论到你们，务要将那从起初所听见的常存在心里。若将从起初所听见的存在心里，你们就必住在子里面，也必住在父里面。主所应许我们的就是永生。

    b. 2 Peter 3:17-18 - Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen.

    b. 彼得后书3:17-18 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既然预先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们。

#### III. Dealing With Objections 处理反对意见

A. Why people may object to the message of God's Word that you are sharing with them.

为何人们可能会反对那些你与他们分享的神的话语信息？

1. They have sincere questions about what you are saying and would like clarification or more information.

    他们对你所说的有疑问，为的是要真诚地弄清楚或得到更多信息。

2. They have a sinful nature that resists talking about their relationship with God. They may raise objections (consciously or unconsciously) to discourage or divert you from talking with them about this important topic. By doing this, they may attempt to make you God's defense attorney rather than His witness to them.

    罪的本质阻止他们讨论与神的关系。他们会提出反对（有意识的或无意识的）来打击你或转移你正在与他们讨论的这个重要话题。通过这样做，他们试图把你从上帝的见证者变成上帝的辩护者。

B. Some Helpful "Dos" and "Do Nots" when people object to your sharing of God's Word with them.

当人们反对你跟他们分享神的话语时，有些有用的“要”和“不要做”的事。

1. Do not argue. Arguing does not get a person into God's kingdom. We are commissioned to win souls, not arguments.

    不要争论。争论并不能让人进入神的国度。我们的使命是赢得灵魂，不是赢得争论。

2. Do not insult or mock the person if he/she reveals a lack of proper understanding of the Gospel message. There was a time when we did not understand God's Word. We are to aid people so they can gain a good understanding.

    不要侮辱或嘲笑那些表现出对福音消息缺乏正确理解的人。我们也有不理解神的话语的时候。我们要帮助他们获得正确的理解。

3. Do not be intimidated by people with great intelligence. All people are sinners in need of the Savior. While some people may have greater knowledge than we do on many matters, they may be completely ignorant of the Gospel, which is the higher wisdom of God and the only power that can save them.

    不要被那些智力超凡的人吓倒。所有人都是罪人，都需要救主。在很多事情上有些人也许比我们懂得更多的知识，他们也许会完全不懂福音，但福音正是上帝的更高的智慧，也是唯一能拯救他们的力量。

4. Keep a friendly attitude and your sense of humor. These will keep the lines of communication open with others so that you can effectively deal with the objection.

    保持友好的态度和幽默感。这些能使你与他人的沟通之道保持畅通，这样你就能更有效地处理这些反对意见。

5. Do not take objections personally. The person's problem is not with you, but with the Lord and His Word.

    不要把反对意见认为是针对个人的。人的问题与你无关，但与上帝和神的话语有关。

6. Do not feel bad if you cannot give expert answers to the person's challenges to your sharing. Some, but not all, of us are call to be "expert witnesses" for God, who know the Bible extremely well and have the ability to explain and defend its message in almost any situation. None of us know everything. We are to witness to what we do know. We will find that some challenges will prompt us to learn more and to grow in our ability to respond to objections people may raise. We should also remember that not every question or objection raised by a person deserves an answer.

    如果人们对你的分享提出挑战，即使不能给出专业的答案也不要沮丧。我们中的一些人， 不是全部，被呼召作上帝的“专家见证者”，他们对圣经非常了解，也有能力在任何情况下解释并维护圣经的信息。我们没有人无所不知。我们只是见证我们知道的事情。我们会发现一些挑战促使我们学习更多知识并在我们对人们可能提出的反对意见的回应上取得长进。我们也应该记住，并不是人们提出的每个问题或反对都是值得回答的。

7. Do not be afraid to honestly admit your lack of knowledge on certain matters. To say: "I do not know how to answer that, but I know someone who can" or to say "I do not know how to answer that, but I will try to find out for you" and then go on to share the basic Law and Gospel message with that person is better than trying to make up an answer that you are not sure of.

    不要害怕诚实地承认你在某些事情上缺乏知识。你可以说：“我不知道怎么回答这个问题，但我知道有人能回答。”或说：“我不知道怎么回答这个问题，但是我会试着为你找答案。”然后继续与人分享律法和福音的消息，这好过试图编造一个你也不确定的答案。

C. A Four point method of dealing with objections.

处理反对意见的四点法。

1. Determine what the real objection is

    确认真正反对的是什么

    Try to determine what is really behind the objection the person makes. The stated objection may not be the real one. Few people tell you what they really think. The objection may be an attempt to cover up for something else.

    试着确认人们提出的反对意见背后的真相。被提出的反对也许并不是问题的所在。很少有人能告诉你他们真正想的是什么。反对意见可能是试图掩饰其他的事情。

2. Accept the objection

    接受反对意见

    Acknowledge the objection. This does not mean that you are agreeing with the person. It means that you are letting the person know that you heard what he/she said and are trying to see things from his/her point of view. There are several ways to accept objections. Some examples are: "Many people feel that way," or "I used to think that way" or "I am glad to hear you say that" or "I am sad to hear you say that" or "I appreciate you honesty" or "Yes, but". (Your response must fit the situation)

    承认反对意见。这并不意味着你同意这人所说的。这意味着你让这个人知道你正在听他/她所说的，并试着从他/她的角度来理解。接受反对意见有几种方式。例如：“很多人都那么觉得，”或“我以前也那么认为，”或“我很高兴听你说那个”或“你那么说我很难过，”或“我欣赏你的诚实”或“是的，但是”。（你的回应必须符合情境）

3. Return the conversation to the witnessing message

    把谈话转回到见证信息上

    By raising the objection, the person has caused you to temporarily leave the important topic of the person's relationship with God. It is important to turn the conversation back to that topic. A good method for doing this is to pick out a key word or thought from the objection and, in a few sentences, use that word or thought to go back to the main subject, the Savior.

    通过提出反对，这个人已经让你暂时从人与神的关系这个重要话题上离开。把谈话转回这个话题非常重要。这么做的一个好办法就是从反对意见中选取一个关键词或重要观点，用几句话，从这个词或观点回到“救主”这个主要话题。

4. Share The Good News

    分享好消息

    Only the Gospel can bring a person to saving faith in Jesus. A person must have a saving relationship with Christ before other spiritual matters are going to make any real sense to him/her. Only faith in Jesus Christ can ultimately overcome the objections raised in unbelief.

    惟有福音能领人信耶稣得救。人必须先与基督的拯救相连，否则他/她不可能，哪怕是一点点地去理解其他属灵的事，惟有对耶稣基督的信心能彻底超越不信的人提出的反对意见。
