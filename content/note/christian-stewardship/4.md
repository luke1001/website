#### I. Our Lord Instructs Us About His Word And Its Use 我们的主将祂的话语和运用指教我们

##### A. The Lord has given us His powerful Word to bless our lives. 主已将祂大能的话语赐给我们好祝福我们的生命。

John 20:21 - But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name

约翰福音20:21 耶稣又对他们说：「愿你们平安！父怎样差遣了我，我也照样差遣你们。」.

1. The Word of God introduces us to Jesus as the Christ, the one who give us eternal life.

    神的话语指教我们耶稣是基督，是赐予我们永生的那一位。

    a. One of the purposes of the Bible is to evangelize - to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ to people so they may be saved.

    圣经的目的之一就是传福音 – 把关乎耶稣基督的福音带给人好使人得救。

    b. A believing knowledge of the Bible is essential to saving relationship with Jesus. The church father, Jerome, (who translated the Bible into Latin centuries ago) said: "Ignorance of the Bible is ignorance of Christ."

    明白相信圣经对于维持与耶稣的关系至关重要。 教父耶柔米（他在数百年前把圣经翻译为拉丁文）说过：“对圣经的无知就是对耶稣的无知”

    Acts 20:32 - Now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

    使徒行传20:32 - 如今我把你们交托 神和他恩惠的道；这道能建立你们，叫你们和一切成圣的人同得基业。

2. The Word of God strengthens and preserves us in saving faith in Jesus.

    神的话语能将我们坚立、保守在耶稣里的救赎之信中。

    a. A second purpose of the Bible is to edify - to build up disciples in their faith in Jesus Christ。

    圣经的第二个目的是教导 – 把门徒建立在耶稣基督里的信心中。

    b. The Lord's Word enables us to strengthen our grip on the Savior-Lord in the middle of a fierce spiritual war in which mighty enemies struggle to draw us or tear us away from Jesus.

    在残酷的属灵争战中强大的敌人竭力想把我们从耶稣那里扯开、撕碎，主的话语能使我们在那时紧紧抓住救主。

    2 Timothy 3:16-17 - 16) All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17) so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

    提摩太后书 3:16-17----16圣经都是神所默示的（或作：凡神所默示的圣经），於教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，17 叫属神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

3. The Word of God prepares us for spiritual service to our Lord and to others.

    神的话语预备我们对主和别人做灵里的服事。

    a. A third purpose of the Bible is to equip - to enable steward-disciples to fulfill their God-given mission in life.

    圣经的第三个目的是装备 – 使得管家-仆人成就他们生活中神所赐的使命。

    b. The Lord's Word is His practical, indispensable tool to teach us about being stewards and disciples. In 2 Timothy, Saint Paul tells us that God's Word helps us in for important ways:

    主的话语是祂用来教导我们成为管家和仆人的不可缺少的实用工具。在提摩太后书中，圣保罗告诉我们神的话能以四种重要的方式来帮助我们：

    1) It teaches us the Christian faith. It imparts the invaluable knowledge of Jesus as our Savior and Lord and His good will for us.

    神的话语能将基督徒的信教训我们。告知我们宝贵的知识：耶稣是我们的救主和祂对我们的美好旨意。

    2) It rebukes. It points out deadly error in doctrine and conduct and also warns us to repent of sin and turn from it.

    神的话语督责我们。指出教义中致命的错误并且引导、警醒我们悔改且远离罪恶。

    3) It corrects. It restores us when we sin and directs us to live in the proper, God-pleasing way.
    
    神的话语能归正。当我们犯罪时重建我们并且指引我们活在正确、神所喜悦的路上。

    4) It trains us in righteousness. It teaches us to live disciplined, serving lives in harmony with God's love and guiding will for us.

    神的话语能教导我们学义。教导我们活出训练有素、殷勤服事的生活，契合神对我们的爱和指引。

4. American president, Abraham Lincoln, summarized the incomparable value of the Bible in this way: "All the good from the Savior of the world is communicated through this Book. All things desirable to people are contained in it."

    美国总统亚伯拉罕林肯，这样总结圣经的无比价值：“所有从这个世界的救主而来的美好都是藉着这本书传递的。所有值得人拥有的事物都在其中。”

##### B. The Lord charges us to make diligent use of His Word. 主指教我们要殷勤使用祂的话语。

John 8:31-32 - 31) To the Jews who had believed Him, Jesus said, "If you hold to My teaching, you are really My disciples. 32) Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

约翰福音8:31-32----31 耶稣对信他的犹太人说：「你们若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的门徒；32 你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自由。」

1. Our Lord directs us to remain faithful to His Word.

    我们的主指引我们忠信于祂的话语。

    Colossians 3:16a - Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom.

    歌罗西书3:16a - 当用各样的智慧，把基督的道理丰丰富富的存在心里，（或作：当把基督的道理丰丰富富的存在心里，以各样的智慧）

2. Our Lord urges us to take the Word of God into our hearts in large amounts and share it freely with others.

    我们的主鼓励我们把神的话语多多的放在心里并且尽量的与人分享。

    James 1:22-25 - 22) Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23) Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24) and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25) But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that give freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does.

    雅各书1:22-25----22 只是你们要行道，不要单单听道，自己欺哄自己。23 因为听道而不行道的，就像人对著镜子看自己本来的面目，24 看见，走後，随即忘了他的相貌如何。25 惟有详细察看那全备，使人自由之律法的，并且时常如此，这人既不是听了就忘，乃是实在行出来，就在他所行的事上必然得福。

3. Our Lord calls on us to remember His Word and to put it into practice in our lives. Jesus has given us His Word, not merely to inform us, but to transform us.

    我们的主要我们记住祂的话语并将之用在我们的生活中。

##### C. Fellow steward-disciples encourage us to make faithful and diligent use of the Lord's Word. 管家-仆人同伴鼓励我们信实、殷勤的使用主的话语。

1. "Whoever would know God and have eternal life should read this Book with diligence and search for its testimony of Christ, God's Son." (Doctor Martin Luther)

    “无论谁要认识神和得永生都当殷勤的读这本书并寻找其对神的儿子，基督的见证。”（马丁路德博士）

2. "I want to know one thing - the way to heaven. . . God Himself has kindly acted to teach the way. He has written it down in a Book. Oh, give me that Book. Here is knowledge enough for me. Let me be a person of this one Book. (John Wesley)

    “我唯愿知道一件事——去天堂的路……神自己切切地如此教导。祂将之写在一本书里。哦，赐给我那本书。知此我将满足，求使我成为属这一本书的人。”（约翰卫斯理）

3. "To do God's work, we must have God's power. To have God's power, we must know God's will. To know God's will, we must study God's Word." (John Mott)

    “要做神的工作，我们必须有神的能力。要有神的能力，我们必须知道神的旨意。要知道神的旨意，我们必须学习神的话语。”（John Mott）

4. "You are not reading the word of a human being, but the word of God, the Most High. He desires students who diligently note and observe what He says. In addition, it is well said that the should be read three times because they must speak with deliberation in order not to be considered fools. How much more necessary it is for one to read the letters of God, that is, the Holy Scriptures - three, four, ten, a hundred, a thousand, and many thousand times. For God speaks with deliberation and weight, in fact, He is the eternal Wisdom itself. Whoever does this becomes better and more learned from Scripture. Whoever does not do so learns nothing, instead he becomes the worse for it." (Doctor Martin Luther)

    “你不是在读人的话语而是至高神的话语。祂喜悦学生勤勉的记录和研究祂所说的话语。此外，正如人们所说君王的信应该读三遍，因为他们不想被人们认为是傻瓜，必定都是经过深思熟虑后才开口。那么，对于从神而来的信件——圣经，人岂不是更应该阅读——三遍、四遍、十遍、百遍、千遍、数千遍吗。因为神所说的即慎重又有份量，祂本身即是永恒的智慧。如此勤勉读经的人会更好的学习圣经。凡不这样做的人什么也学不到，反而会变得更糟。”（马丁路德博士）

5. Truly, my dear Christians, you cannot read too much in the Scripture. What you read you cannot read too attentively. What you read attentively, you cannot understand too well. What you understand, you cannot teach too well. What you teach you cannot practice too well. (Doctor Martin Luther)

    我实在告诉你，亲爱的基督徒，你们不可能会读经读得过多。在你所读的经文中，你们不可能读的过于用心。在你所用心读的经文中，你们不可能过于明白。在你明白的经文中，你不可能教导的过于好。你所教导的，你们不可能遵行的过于好。（马丁路德博士）

##### D. Consider the dangers of neglecting or misusing the Lord's Word 留意忽略或错误使用主话语的危险

1. Many people are literally gambling with their spiritual lives by their neglect or misuse of God's Word. Their thinking is expressed well by this quotation: "I am a gambler. I am not the kind of gambler that visits a casino. I do not place bets on races or sporting events. I am a person who gambles with my soul. I am betting that I can live a life of indifference, a life of neglect of the Word of God, and still receive His blessings."

    很多人或是忽略或是错误使用神的话语，这确实是在拿他们的属灵生命来赌博。他们的想法在下面这句话中表现无疑“我是一个赌徒。我不是那种去赌场的玩家。我不在竞赛或体育运动上下赌注。我是拿我的灵魂来赌博的人。我赌我可以过一个漠不关心，一个忽略神话语的生活，还能得到神的祝福。”

2. One person, who was fully convinced what a serious matter it is to misuse God's Word and who knew how commonly this is done, said, "The three greatest sins of our time are 1) indifference to God's Word, 2) neglect of God's Word, and 3) disrespect for God's Word."

    有一个人，他深信错误使用神的话语是极为严重的问题，并且知道这种做法是多么的普遍，他曾说，“我们的时代有三种最大的罪，1）漠不关心神的话语，2）忽略神的话语，和3）不尊重神的话语。”

3. Neglecting and misusing God's Word in other ways has some disastrous consequences for people: 

    忽略和错误使用神的话语会对人们造成的灾难性的后果：

    a. People never come to faith in Christ or they lose the faith they once had.

    人们永远无法在基督里相信或者失去他们曾有的信心。

    b. People become stunted and deformed in their spiritual growth and development.

    人们的属灵成长和发展变得发育不良和畸形。

    c. People become more vulnerable to spiritual deception and adopt false beliefs.

    人们更易于受到灵里的欺骗及采取错误的信条。

    d. People become so weak spiritually that they cannot handle temptations or endure trials well.

    人们灵里更软弱以至于他们无法抵抗试探或忍受试炼。

    e. People become unfit to serve God properly.

    人们变得不适合正常的服事神。

##### E. Our Lord Jesus directs us to examine our use of His Word carefully 我们的主耶稣指引我们要省察自己小心的使用祂的话语

Matthew 7:24-27 - 24) Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25) The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26) But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27) The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.

马太福音7:24-27----24「所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上；25 雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子总不倒塌，因为根基立在磐石上。26 凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上；27 雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子就倒塌了，并且倒塌得很大。」

1. Jesus used this powerful story to end His Sermon on the Mount in which He gave His followers intensive instruction on how they were to live as His steward-disciples.

    耶稣使用这个有力的故事来作为登山宝训的结束讲章。在那里，祂集中教导祂的跟随者如何过一个做祂管家-仆人式的生活。

2. Jesus wants His steward-disciples to ask themselves these all-important questions:

    耶稣希望祂的管家-仆人自问如下重要的问题：

    a. Do I realize that I am to be concerned with the process of building my spiritual life?

    我是否意识到，建造我属灵生活的过程是被关注的？

    b. Am I building my life wisely by faithfully hearing and practicing the words of my Savior and Lord?

    我是否藉着忠信的听道并遵行我救主的话语来聪明的建造我的生命？

    c. Is my spiritual life being built solidly on the Word of God so that it can withstand the fierce storm of God's judgment?

    我的属灵生命是否坚实的建造在神的话语上，以至于能够经受神严酷的审判。

#### II. Things To Help Steward-Disciples Study God's Word 有助于管家-仆人学习神话语的事项

##### A. A Proper Attitude/Approach Toward The Use Of The Bible 对应用圣经采取一个合宜的态度

1. Bible study is enriching. Our loving Lord Jesus is communicating with us in the Bible. The Bible is His personal set of "love letters" to give us treasures that we can find nowhere else. We open our Bibles expecting that we will receive great blessings from our study of the Word.

    圣经学习能充实我们。我们慈爱的主耶稣藉着圣经与我们交通。圣经是祂亲自写给我们的“情书”，是我们无法在其它任何地方找得到的宝贝。当我们打开圣经时，即期盼着从圣经学习中得到极大的祝福。

2. Bible study takes some time and effort. Many good things in life take time and effort. Bible study is one of them. Study's God's Word is like learning to play a musical instrument. Regular, diligent disciplined practice is required if we are going to become proficient at it.

    圣经学习需要花时间和精力。生命中的许多美好的事物都需要花时间和精力。圣经即是其中之一。学习神的话语就像是学习演奏一种乐器。如果我们想熟练掌握就必须进行持之以恒的勤奋学习。

3. Bible study is for every day and for our whole life long.

    圣经学习要天天进行并且是一生之久。

    a. The famous Bible teacher and evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, once said: "Just as a person cannot take a breath of oxygen big enough to live for a week or just as a person cannot eat enough at one meal to live for six months, so a person cannot take in enough of God's Word in one sermon or study to sustain his/her spiritual life and health for a long time. We must draw on God's store of grace in His Word from day to day as we need it."

    著名的圣经教师和福音布道家慕迪曾说：“就像人不可能仅靠深吸一口气来活一周，又如人不可能仅吃一顿饭而活半年一样，人也不能在一篇讲章或一次学习中得到足够的神的话语来长久维持他/她的属灵生命和健康。我们必须每日的按照我们的需要从祂的话语中汲取神所预备的恩典。”

    b. Everett Harris said: "No believer ever graduates from Bible study until he/she meets the Bible's Author face to face."

    Harris曾说：“没有任何信徒可以在圣经学习中毕业，直到他/她面对面的见到圣经的作者之时。”

##### B. Reading the Bible Profitably 有益的阅读圣经

1. "The hours spent reading are investments in tomorrow. For reading sends us into the future with a great reservoir of knowledge from which we can draw at various times." (C. Neil Strait)

    “花在阅读上的时间是对明天的投资。因为在迈向未来的路上，阅读给我们预备了一个丰富的知识储备，可供我们不断的汲取。”

2. Reading the Bible helps us develop the greatest reservoir of knowledge possible - the knowledge of God and His will.

    阅读圣经能帮助我们发现最大的知识宝库——对神和祂旨意的知识。

3. The 66 books of the Bible have 1,189 chapters. The entire Bible can be read in about 90 hours by the average person.

    圣经的66卷书包含1189章。一个普通人可以在90小时内读完整本圣经。

4. Suggestions for reading the Bible

    阅读圣经的建议

    a. Read 10 chapters of the Bible each day and you will read the Bible 3 times in a year.

    b. Read 23 chapters of the Bible each week (3 chapters for 6 days and 5 chapters on 1 day) and you will read the Bible once in a year.

    每周读23章圣经（在6天内每天3章，有1天读5章）你就可以一年内读完整本圣经。

    c. Read 1 chapter each day and look for a key thought to remember in that chapter.

    e. Highlight key verses (underlining or marking them) as you read.

    g. Read the notes in a good study Bible or read a sound Bible commentary along with reading the text of the Bible.

    在读经的时候同时参阅较好的启导本圣经中的注解或是一本好的解经书。

##### C. Studying The Bible Productively 有成效的学习圣经

1. The advantage of Bible study over Bible reading has been compared to the advantage of taking a tour of a museum in daylight as opposed to taking the tour at night with only a flashlight. By studying the Bible carefully, we can see its message more clearly.

    在读经的同时进行圣经学习的好处就像是在白天参观博物馆和在晚上打着手电参观之间的差别。藉着认真的圣经学习，我们可以更清楚的明白其中的信息。

2. Some of the benefits of Bible study

    d. Act: Put into practice the things God has told you.

4. A Three Step Scripture Study Method

    三步圣经学习法

    a. Observation: What does this passage of the Bible say?

    观察：这段圣经所讲的内容是什么？

    Be clear on what the Bible portion really says

    弄清楚这部分经文真正在讲什么

    Note what the passage does not say

    祈求神向你显明、教导你要学习的内容

#### III. Memorizing the Lord's Word 记忆主的话语

##### A. The memorization of God's Word is valuable 记忆神的话是非常宝贵的

Psalm 119:11, 13-14 - 11) I have hidden Your word in my heart that I may not sin against You. 13) With my lips I recount all the laws that come from Your mouth. 14) I rejoice in following Your statutes as one rejoices in great riches.

诗篇119:11 我将你的话藏在心里， 免得我得罪你。

诗篇119:13-14----13 我用嘴唇传扬你口中的一切典章。 14 我喜悦你的法度， 如同喜悦一切的财物。

1. Committing God's Word to memory aids us in our fight against sin and adds to our joy as we recall our knowledge of God's good and gracious will.

    把神的话语记下来能帮助我们抵挡罪，并且当我们回想起神美好良善的旨意时就加添了我们的喜乐。

    Matthew 4:4a - Jesus answered, "It is written."

    马太福音4:4a - 耶稣却回答说：「经上记着说……」

2. Our Lord Jesus Himself is the perfect example of the value of committing God's Word to memory. He used His knowledge of God's Word, gained through memorization, to defeat Satan's temptations and to fulfill the saving mission that God the Father had given Him.

    我们的主耶稣自己就是记忆神的话语的完美榜样。祂藉着对神话语的记忆得以使用神的话语来击败撒旦的试探，并且成就父神所给祂的救赎事工。

##### B. Memorizing Helps 帮助记忆的方法

1. Set a goal to memorize verses of Scripture. (Example: This year, I will memorize one verse/set of verses of the Bible every week)

    对记忆经文设立目标（例如：今年我要每周记一节/段经文）

2. Select and organize the verses you will memorize. (Putting the verses on note cards is a good way to do this)

    选择并对要记得经文分类（把经文抄写在卡片上可以很好的做到这一点）

3. Learn the Bible reference along with the words of the verse.

    同时学习这一节经文的参考资料。

4. Speak the Bible verse out loud and give yourself verbal and written reviews to involve other senses in the learning process.

    大声诵读圣经经文并做口头和默写测验在学习过程中调动各种感官。

##### C. 51 Key Bible passages to know from memory. 51节需要记忆的经文。

1. The Two Great Commandments

    最大的两个诫命

    Matthew 22:37-39 Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

    马太福音22:37-39----37 耶稣对他说：「你要尽心、尽性、尽意爱主—你的　神。38 这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。39 其次也相仿，就是要爱人如己。

2. Scripture Is Inspired For Our Growth

    圣经是帮助我们成长的默示

    2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the person of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

    提摩太后书3:16-17----16 圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的，17 叫属　神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事。

3. Christ's Love Moves Us To Live For Him

    基督的爱激励我们为祂而活

    2 Corinthians 5:14-15 For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And He died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for Him who died for them and was raised again.

    哥林多后书5:14-15----14 原来基督的爱激励我们；因我们想，一人既替众人死，众人就都死了；15 并且他替众人死，是叫那些活着的人不再为自己活，乃为替他们死而复活的主活。

4. Scripture Is Given To Lead Us To Faith In Christ

    圣经是要叫我们信基督

    John 20:31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.

    约翰福音20:31 但记这些事要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是　神的儿子，并且叫你们信了他，就可以因他的名得生命。
