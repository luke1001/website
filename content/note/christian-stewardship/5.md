We thank You for Your saving work and for the opportunities Your provide to draw closer to Your and the Father and the Holy Spirit and to communicate with You in a meaningful, heartfelt way. Teach us to treasure highly the privileges of prayer and worship in our life of faith. Instruct us how we may pray and worship in proper, pleasing ways. Move us to use better these opportunities to honor You as our living, loving Lord and to receive Your help. We ask this in Your good and gracious name. Amen.

    我们可能会失于向神祈求我们所当求的。“生活中的一大悲剧不是没有得到回应的祷告而是没有献上的祷告。” (Frederick B. Meyer)

    雅各书5:16b-18----16 所以你们要彼此认罪，互相代求，使你们可以得医治。义人祈祷所发的力量是大有功效的。17 以利亚与我们是一样性情的人，他恳切祷告，求不要下雨，雨就三年零六个月不下在地上。18 他又祷告，天就降下雨来，地也生出土产。

1. We are to pray in Jesus' name, that means, to pray with the belief that Jesus is our Savior and Lord and that is it only because of Jesus and what He had done to save us that we have favor with God and that our prayers to God are accepted and will be answered.

    我们是奉耶稣的名祷告，这意味着，如此祷告是相信耶稣是我们的救主，并且只因为耶稣和祂使我们得救所做的一切，我们才得以在神面前蒙恩；我们向神的祷告才得以被接纳及回应。

Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7) and when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8) Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. 9) This, then, is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name, 10)Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. 11) Give us today our daily bread, 12) Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13) And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

    马太福音6:7-13----7 你们祷告，不可像外邦人，用许多重复话，他们以为话多了必蒙垂听。8 你们不可效法他们；因为你们没有祈求以先，你们所需用的，你们的父早已知道了。9 所以，你们祷告要这样说： 我们在天上的父： 愿人都尊你的名为圣。 10 愿你的国降临； 愿你的旨意行在地上， 如同行在天上。 11 我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。 12 免我们的债， 如同我们免了人的债。 13 不叫我们遇见试探； 救我们脱离凶恶。 因为国度、权柄、荣耀，全是你的， 直到永远。阿们！

4. We are to pray sincerely and thoughtfully, concentrating on heartfelt communication with our Lord.

    我们的祷告是真诚且深思的，专注于用心与我们的主交通。

5. We are to pray primarily for spiritual matters, acknowledging that these are the greatest needs of our lives.

    我们主要祈求属灵的事，明白这些才是我们生活中最大的需要。

    The prayer of a six-year-old Christian boy gets to the heart of the important things to pray for. He prayed, "Dear Jesus, make me like You when You were six years old."

    有个六岁的基督徒小男孩的祷告说明了什么是最要紧的祈求。他这样祷告“亲爱的耶稣，求你使我像你六岁的时候一样。”

    Ephesians 6:18 - And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.

    路加福音18:1 - 耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心。

7. We are to pray persistently, not giving up in our requests until God makes His answer clear to us.

    我们要坚持不懈的祷告，绝不放弃我们的祈求直到神清楚的向我们回应。

##### F. We are to avoid dangerous misconceptions about prayer. 我们要避免一些对祷告的误解。

1. Misconception #1 - "God is my servant or waiter. I pray to Him to tell Him what I want Him to do for me."

    误解#1 - “神是我的仆人或服务生。我向祂祷告就是告诉祂我想让祂为我做什么。”

    a. Because of God's great love for us in Christ, we can ask Him to do things However, we cannot order or command Him to do anything. He is God and we are not. He has authority over us. We do not have authority over Him.

    因为神在基督里对我们的大爱，我们可以祈求祂。但是，我们不可能命令或指挥祂做任何事。祂是神，我们不是。祂有权柄管辖我们。我们没有权柄指使祂。

    b. True prayer is not requiring or demanding that God do what we want. Rather it is submitting our wishes to desire, accept and do what He wants.

    真正的祷告不是要求或命令神为我们做我们想要的事。而是将我们的愿望顺服在祂所喜悦的事上，接受并做祂所愿意我们做的事上。

2. Misconception #2 - "God must give me everything I ask for. In Mark 11:24, Jesus says, 'Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.'"

    误解 #2 - “神必须给我一切所求的。在马可福音11:24节那里，耶稣说，‘所以我告诉你们，凡你们祷告祈求的，无论是什么，只要信是得着的，就必得着。’”

    a. God does hear and answer every truly offered prayer by His Christians. But God does not answer - and He does not have to answer every prayer with the reply: "Yes, I will give this to you."

    神的确倾听并回应每一个属祂的基督徒真诚的祷告。但是神却不回应——也不需要对每个祷告都如此回应：“好的，我会把这个赐给你。”

    b. Jesus teaches us that proper prayer is also one that is offered according to God's will (1 John 5:14). God, who is wiser than we are and who lovingly seeks what is in our best interest, may choose to delay or to deny giving us the thing we request for our good.

    耶稣教导我们合宜的祷告将是按照神旨意所求的（约翰一书5:14）。神比我们更有智慧并且满有慈爱的为使我们得最大的益处，祂可能会因为为我们好的缘故而暂缓或拒绝我们的祈求。

    c. We may request things of our God boldly and confidently with the assurance that whatever God's answer is, it is the very best for us.

    我们可以大胆的向我们的神祈求并且确信无论神如何回应，那都将是对我们最有益处的。

3. Misconception #3 - "I can bargain with God in prayer, I can get Him to answer my prayer on the basis of what I have done or will do for Him."

    误解 #3 - “我可以在祷告中与神谈条件，我可以凭我所做的或将要为祂做的事来使祂回应我的祷告。”

    a. God does not accept or answer our prayers on the basis of human merit. God accepts and answers prayers only because of His mercy and the merits of His Son, Jesus Christ.

    神不会因为人的作为而接受或回应我们的祷告。神接受或回应祷告只因为祂的恩惠和祂儿子耶稣基督的作为。

    b. To attempt to bargain with God in prayer is insulting to Him and is no real prayer at all.

    在祷告中向神谈条件是对神的冒犯，这绝不是真正的祷告。

    c. We do make a distinction between a bargaining prayer (which tries to bribe God) and a grateful promise (which honors and thanks God in response to His blessings.)

    但讨价还价的祷告（试图贿赂神）是与感恩的许诺（因着神的祝福而感谢赞美神）不同的。

##### G. Helps For A Richer Prayer Life 有助于丰富祷告生活的提醒

1. Know that you can call on God in prayer at any time in any situation. He is your dear Savior, your loving Father, your best Friend, Pray often in formal and informal ways throughout the day.

    知道你可以在任何情形任何时间下向神祷告。祂是你亲爱的救主，你慈爱的父亲，你最好的朋友，在每一天中常常正式的、随时的向神祷告。

2. Have regular times (such as early morning, late evening, meal times) for prayer. Without a regularity to our prayer life, we can easily allow other matters to interfere with and take up our time to converse with our Lord.

    设定常规的祷告时间（比如早上，晚间，餐前）。如果我们的祷告生活失去规律，我们就很容易使其他事情干扰并占据我们与神交通的时间。

3. Plan your prayers. Think about what you want to say. You may even want to keep a written prayer list to remind you of things.

    计划你的祷告。思想你想要说的。你甚至可以将祷告事项写下来以帮助你的记忆。

4. Prepare your heart. Let God speak to you first in His Word. Remember your Savior's gracious invitations and unfailing promises to hear your prayers.

    预备你的心。让神首先藉着祂的话来向你说话。记住，你的救主慈爱的邀请和可靠的应许要听你的祷告。

5. Be clear, concise and specific. The attitude of our hearts and the content of our prayers are more important than their length.

    要清楚、简洁和具体。我们心里的态度和我们祷告的内容比祷告的长短更重要。

6. Once you finish praying, let God take care of the things that only He can do. You take care of the things He wants you to do.

    每当你结束祷告时，让神来处理祂所能作的事。你要留心做祂愿意你所做的事。

##### II. We Meet With Our Lord In Worship 我们在敬拜中与我们的主见面

##### A. Our Lord calls us to worship Him. 我们的主召我们敬拜祂。

Psalm 95:1-2, 6-7 - 1) Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. 2) Let us come before Him with thanksgiving and extol Him with music and song. . . 6) Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; 7) for He is our God and we are the people of the pasture, the flock under His care.

传道书5:1 - 你到　神的殿要谨慎脚步；因为近前听，胜过愚昧人献祭，他们本不知道所做的是恶。

Matthew 15:8-9a - 8) These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me. 9) They worship Me in vain.

马太福音15:8-9a - 8 这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我， 心却远离我； 9 他们将人的吩咐当作道理教导人， 所以拜我也是枉然。」

1. The time of worship is one of the most serious times of the week. In worship, we have a sacred meeting with God Himself. It is a time when God seeks the full attention of our hearts, souls and minds as we listen to His Word and receive His blessings and then respond to Him in our prayers and praises.

    敬拜的时间是一周里最重要的时间。在敬拜中，我们和神自己有一个神圣的会面。在那时，神要我们将全部的心、灵和思想放在听道和得蒙祝福上，然后藉着我们的祷告和赞美来向祂回应。

2. Some people make these terrible mistakes in life: Instead of working at their work, playing at their play and worshipping at their worship; they worship their work, they work at their play, and they play at their worship.

    有些人在生活中犯了一些如下的错误：没有在工作中努力，闲暇时玩耍，敬拜时崇拜；反而是在崇拜他们的工作，在享乐中努力，在敬拜中玩耍。

##### F. Helps For a Richer Worship Life 有助于丰富敬拜生活的提醒

1. Attend worship services regularly at a church or fellowship that faithfully teaches God's Word. Do not let other things come ahead of these important appointments with the Lord.

    定期的参加忠信的教导神话语的教会或团契的崇拜。不要让其它任何事排在与神的重要约定之先。

2. Arrive early for the service and prepare for worship by previewing the elements of the service (service theme, hymns, readings, prayers), by meditating on God's Word and by praying for God's blessings on the service and worshippers.

    提前到达事奉地点，通过预习事奉的的每一步来预备敬拜（事奉时间、诗歌、读经、祷告），默想神的话并祈求神祝福事奉和敬拜者。

3. If the Holy Supper is being celebrated, take time to prepare for receiving it with a knowing mind and believing heart.

    如果要举行圣餐礼，要花时间来预备自己，用明白和相信的心来领受。

    2 Corinthians 13:5 – Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?

    哥林多后书13:5 - 你们总要自己省察有信心没有，也要自己试验。岂不知你们若不是可弃绝的，就有耶稣基督在你们心里吗？

    Before we attend Holy Communion, God wants us to examine ourselves to see if we are sorry for our sins, trust in Jesus’ forgiveness for us and recognize what Holy Communion is and gives.

    在我们参加圣餐礼之前，神愿意我们自己省察是否为自己的罪懊悔，是否相信耶稣赦免了我们，并明白圣餐是什么、会带给我们什么。

    A good method of preparation is to ask ourselves these questions:

    一个很好的预备方法是问自己如下的问题：
    
    a. Do I believe that I am a sinner? (Yes)

    我是否相信我是一个罪人？（是）

    b. Am I sorry for my sins? (Yes)

    我是否为自己的罪懊悔？（是）

    c. Do I believe that Jesus is my Savior from sin and that He has earned forgiveness for me by His life, death and resurrection? (Yes)

    我是否相信耶稣是救我脱离罪的救主，祂用自己的降生、受死和复活为我赢得救恩?(是)

    d. Do I believe that in the Lord’s Supper I actually receive with the bread and wine the true body and blood of Jesus for the assurance of the forgiveness of my sins? (Yes)

    我是否相信在圣餐中，我领受的饼和杯是真实的耶稣的血和身体，得以确保我的罪得以赦免？（是）

    e. Do I desire to improve my sinful life and, with God helping me, dedicate my life ever more to Christ and to His service? (Yes)

    我是否愿意改变我有罪的生命并且，藉着神的帮助，将我的生命更完全的献给基督并事奉祂？（是）

4. Concentrate on each part of the service. Participate actively in the service by singing, praying and listening. Fight against distractions. Using the worship materials. Take written notes on the sermon.

    专心敬拜的每一部分。在唱诗、祷告和听道中积极参与敬拜，避免分心的事。使用敬拜的资料。在讲章上记笔记。

5. Greet fellow worshippers before and after the service. Your fellow Christians are your spiritual brothers and sisters. Show them your love and give them spiritual encouragement and support.

    在敬拜开始前和结束时向一同敬拜的人问好。你的基督徒同伴是你灵里的弟兄和姐妹。关爱他们并在灵里勉励支持他们。

6. Review the sermon later on, discuss it with others, and seek to put God's message into practice.

    稍后要回顾讲章，与别人讨论，并尝试把神的话语付之于实践。
