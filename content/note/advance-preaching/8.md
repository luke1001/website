### I. Planning For Preaching 为讲道做计划

It is wise for the preacher to do plan important aspects of sermon planning in advance. Careful, advanced planning will save the preacher from hurried decisions that allow too little thought or time to prepare well designed and effective sermons. Following are some suggestions for planning ahead to help preachers of God's life-giving Word to prepare messages that will serve the needs of the hearers.

讲道的人能事先预备讲章中的重要部分是智慧之举。精心预备的计划将使讲道的人免于做出仓促的决定，避免不能充分思考或缺乏足够的时间来预备用心设计和有效的讲章。以下是一些预备的建议，可以帮助那些传讲神赐生命之道的人来预备信息来服事听众的需要。

#### A. Selecting Sermon Texts 选择讲章的经文

One important area of careful planning for preaching is selecting sermon texts from the Bible well before they will be studied and developed into sermons. Some of the common methods of selecting texts with their strengths and weaknesses are as follows:

在研究和在讲章中展开这些经文之前，把经文从圣经中选择出来是精心预备讲道的一个重要方面。以下是一些常见的选择圣经的方法以及它们的优缺点：

1. Following A Church Year Lectionary/Pericope. 

    按照教会周年经文选集/日课进行选择

    Many Christian preachers follow a one year or multiple-year series of biblical texts that have been carefully chosen to treat major events and teachings over the course of a year. These series consist of an Old Testament, Epistle and Gospel lesson for each Sunday. These series are called either a “lectionary” which means “readings” or a “pericope” which literally means “a cutting out” and refers to a set of Bible verses that form a unit of thought that is suitable for reading and preaching.

    很多基督徒讲道者遵从一年或数年的圣经经文系列来讲道，这些经文系列是对应每年中的主要事件和教导来精心选择的。这些系列在每个主日都包含一处旧约圣经、使徒书信和福音书的经文。这样的系列被称为“经文选集（Lectionary）”意思是“阅读的经文”或“日课（pericope）”其字面意思是“摘录”意为适宜于阅读或讲道的、表达同一意图的一组圣经经文。

    The Christian Church year begins with a focus on the life and work of Jesus Christ, starting with His coming into the world and proceeding to cover His ministry and revelation of Himself as the Savior, His suffering and death, and finally His resurrection and ascension. The second half of the Christian Church year covers more general themes that address the Christian's faith and life.

    基督教年历基于耶稣基督在世的生活和工作，起始于祂的降世，按照祂的事工进程推进依次为，显现祂为救主，祂的受难和受死，最终祂的复活和升天。教会年历的第二部分涉及基督徒信心和生活的一般性主题。

    Following a Church Year Lectionary or Pericope has the advantages of having texts already laid out in manageable sections and an orderly way for the preacher to work with. The lectionaries or pericopes offer biblical material that is varied and rich in doctrinal and practical content. This method helps the preacher avoid a tendency to avoid certain teachings or to focus only on favorite topics in his preaching.

    遵从圣经经文系列或日课的优点是，经文已经被整理为易于使用和有序的段落，使讲道的人可以直接采用。经文系列或日课提供了合乎圣经的素材，包含着各种富含教义和实践的内容。这种方法帮助讲道的人避免忽略某种教导的倾向或是在讲道中有偏好的问题。

    The disadvantages of this method are minor. Some texts may prove to be too difficult for an inexperienced preacher to work with. Some of the appointed lessons for a particular Sunday may not address some urgent needs that arise in the congregation. In cases like this the preacher may wish to substitute a more suitable text.

    这种方式的缺点很小。有些经文可能对不熟练的讲道人员来说太难掌握。有些特定的主日所指定的经文可能没有满足会众中产生的迫切需要。如果发生这样的情况，讲道的人可以用能适合的经文来代替。

2. Choosing Books Of The Bible. 

    选择圣经整卷书

    Some choose to preach through entire books of the Bible. One great advantage of this method is that people can become more familiar with the contents of individual books. One great challenge is to divide the Bible book into sections that are suitable for sermon texts.

    有些人选择传讲圣经中的一卷书。这种方法的最大优点是人们可以对每卷书中的内容更加熟悉。这种方法的最大挑战是如何把一卷书分段使之适用于讲章的经文。

3. Series. 

    系列

    Another way to choose sermon texts is to preach on a series that runs for a number of weeks. Some examples of sermon series are 1） the parts of The Apostles Creed, 2） the parts of The Lord's Prayer, 3） the Parables of Jesus, 4） the Miracles of Jesus, 5）， the 7 Letters to the Churches of the Revelation, 6） the 7 “I Am” Statements of Jesus in the Gospel of John, 7） Jesus' 7 Statements from the Cross, 8） The Beatitudes Jesus taught in Matthew 5:1-11, 9） The Ten Commandments. Using a series allows for a special focus on some aspect of Biblical teaching.

    另一种选择讲章经文的方式是在数周内按照一个系列来讲道。一些讲章系列的例子有1）使徒信经的一部分， 2）主祷文的一部分， 3）耶稣的比喻，4）耶稣所行的神迹，5）启示录中写给七间教会的书信，6）在约翰福音中耶稣所说的七个“我是”,7）十架七言，8）在马太福音5:1-11中，耶稣的登山宝训的教导，9）十诫。使用一个系列可以专注于圣经教导的某一方面。

4. Preacher's Weekly Choice. 

    讲道者每周的自由选择

    Some prefer to personally choose a text to preach on from week to week. This method allows for the preacher to quickly address current needs in the congregation. One potential drawback to this approach is that the preacher settle on making choices that omits key teachings that would benefit God's people.

    有些人喜欢每周自己选择经文来讲道。这种方法允许讲道者很快的满足会众当前的需要。这种方法有一个可能的缺点是讲道者所做的安排可能会忽略对神的子民有益的关键教导。

#### B. Criteria For A Good Sermon Text 优秀的讲章经文的评判准则

No matter which method or combination of methods a person uses to select Biblical texts for preaching, there are some important criteria to keep in mind regarding a suitable text.

无论人们使用何种方法或几种方法的结合来选择用于讲道的圣经经文，要选出合宜的经文都需要考虑这几点重要的评判准则。

A good text for preaching will: 

一个合宜的用于讲道的经文将会是：

1. Be a complete unit of thought. 

    具有完整的意图。

2. Have adequate material that is of practical value to the hearer. 

    其内容足以对听众产生实用价值。

3. Contain some specific Law and Gospel. 

    包含一些特定的律法和福音。

### II. Special Sermons 特殊讲章

A preacher of God's Word will occasionally be required to preach for special occasions. These special occasions will require the selection of appropriate texts from which to develop sermons. Some of these occasions and things to keep in mind while selecting texts for them follow.

一个传讲神话语的讲道者有时将被要求在特殊场合下讲道。这些特殊场合需要和选择一些合宜的经文来制定出讲章。在选择经文的时候需要考虑以下一些场合和事项。

#### A. Wedding Sermons 婚礼讲章

Weddings call for positive, joyful and encouraging messages. Some things to include in wedding sermons are the sacredness of marriage, God's loving purposes for marriage, the duties of spouses and their relationship, God's interest and care for people in marriage, and the message of sin and grace, Law and Gospel especially for those in attendance who are not Christians.

婚礼需要正面的、喜乐和鼓舞的信息。可以包含在婚礼讲章中的信息有婚礼的神圣，神对婚礼所有的慈爱的心意，夫妻的责任和关系，神对结婚的人的关注，以及对于参加婚礼的非基督徒准备的罪和恩典的信息，律法和福音的信息。

#### B. Funeral Sermons 葬礼讲章

Funerals require positive, comforting and hopeful messages. Some things to include in funeral sermons are the reality of death, the blessed condition of departed believers, the hope of the resurrection, the comfort of God's promises, the glories of everlasting life with God, and the way of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

葬礼需要正面，安慰和有盼望的信息。葬礼的讲章应该包括死亡的事实，离世信徒蒙福的情形，复活的盼望，神的应许所给我们的安慰，在永生中与神同在的荣耀，藉着相信耶稣基督而得着救恩的途径。

#### C. Mission Of The Church Sermons 教会事工的讲章

Church dedications, church anniversaries and mission festivals are occasions in which the preacher will want to emphasize the wonderful mission God has given His believers to make disciples for Christ through the preaching and teaching of God's Word. Mission of the Church sermons are occasions to focus attention of the proclaiming of the true Word of God, sharing the Gospel with unbelievers, and using God's Word to strengthen and build of the faith of Christians.

在献堂礼，教会周年纪念日和事工节日等场合，讲道者将要强调神赋予门徒的伟大使命，就是藉着传道和教导神的话语来使人成为基督的门徒。教会事工的讲章可用于强调传讲神的真道，向未信者传福音，使用神的话语来加强和建立基督徒的信心。
