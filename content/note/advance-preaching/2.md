#### B. New Testament Sample Text: Luke 16:19-31 新约经文示范：路加福音16:19-31 

-“The Rich Man And Lazarus” 

Text: 19） “There was a rich man, who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20） At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21） and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22） The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23） In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24） So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' 25） But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26） And beside all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us. 27） He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28） for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' 29） Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' 30） 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' 31） He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.‘”

-“财主与拉撒路”

19 「有一个财主穿着紫色袍和细麻布衣服，天天奢华宴乐。20 又有一个讨饭的，名叫拉撒路，浑身生疮，被人放在财主门口，21 要得财主桌子上掉下来的零碎充饥，并且狗来舔他的疮。22 后来那讨饭的死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。财主也死了，并且埋葬了。23 他在阴间受痛苦，举目远远地望见亚伯拉罕，又望见拉撒路在他怀里，24 就喊着说：『我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头；因为我在这火焰里，极其痛苦。』25 亚伯拉罕说：『儿啊，你该回想你生前享过福，拉撒路也受过苦；如今他在这里得安慰，你倒受痛苦。26 不但这样，并且在你我之间，有深渊限定，以致人要从这边过到你们那边是不能的；要从那边过到我们这边也是不能的。』27 财主说：『我祖啊！既是这样，求你打发拉撒路到我父家去；28 因为我还有五个弟兄，他可以对他们作见证，免得他们也来到这痛苦的地方。』29 亚伯拉罕说：『他们有摩西和先知的话可以听从。』30 他说：『我祖亚伯拉罕哪，不是的，若有一个从死里复活的，到他们那里去的，他们必要悔改。』31 亚伯拉罕说：『若不听从摩西和先知的话，就是有一个从死里复活的，他们也是不听劝。』」

1. Understanding The Text 理解经文

    What are some things in the text that we and others may be specially interested in or may need some help to understand?

    在这段经文中，哪些是我们和其他人可能尤其感兴趣或需要帮助才能理解的地方？

    -v.21 Why did the dogs lick Lazarus' sores? The dogs were not friendly dogs that were trying to comfort Lazarus. They were wild dogs whose licking of Lazarus' sores made it easier for him to be exposed to infections and become more sick. We also notice that Lazarus was so weak and had no one to help him so he was not even able to keep these dogs away from him.

    在21节 中，为什么狗舔拉撒路的疮？这些狗不是安慰拉撒路的友好的狗。他们是野狗。他们舔拉撒路的疮会使他的伤口更容易受感染而加重病情。我们也注意到拉撒路非常虚弱，没有人帮助他，他甚至无法赶走这些野狗。

    -v.22 What or where is Abraham's side? The original Greek is better translated “Abraham's bosom or chest.” The bosom or chest is the place where we embrace our loved ones. It is a place where we show special affection, care and comfort for others. Abraham was the father of the Jewish people and of all believers in the true God. Abraham was declared innocent of his sins and was considered righteous before God by his faith in the promised Savior. He died and his soul went to be with God in heaven. Abraham's bosom is another terms for “heaven.” This is the only place in the Bible where Jesus uses this term to describe heaven. The term “Abraham's bosom” lets us know that believers go to live in heaven after their earthly life ends and enjoy a special care and comfort in the company of other believers.

    在22节中，亚伯拉罕的旁边是什么意思，在何处？“亚伯拉罕的胸膛或怀中”为希腊文原文的更好的翻译。胸膛或怀中是我们拥抱我们所爱的人的地方。它是我们表达特别的感情，关怀和安慰他人的地方。亚伯拉罕是犹太人和所有相信真神的信徒之父。亚伯拉罕籍着相信所应许的救主在神面前被宣告无罪，视为义人。他死后，他的灵魂去天国与神同在。亚伯拉罕的怀中是“天国”的另一种表达方式。在圣经中，耶稣只在这里采取了这种方式来描述天国。“亚伯拉罕的胸膛”的说法让我们知道信徒在世上的生命结束后将去天国，和其他信徒一起享受特别的关怀和安慰。

    -v.22 What is interesting about the angels carrying Lazarus to heaven? We often think that dying is a lonely and frightening experience. Here God shows us that believers are not alone when they die and that they have nothing to be afraid of. A loving God sends His holy angels to greet the souls of his Christians when they die and take them immediately and safely to enjoy eternal life in heaven.

    在22节中，天使把拉撒路带到天国的信息有什么引起兴趣的地方？我们经常认为死亡是孤单和可怕的经历。这里神向我们显示信徒死时并不孤单，他们毫无畏惧可言。慈爱的神会派圣洁的天使迎接信徒的灵魂，立刻安全地带他们到天国享受永生。

    -vs.23-26 What do we learn about hell? Jesus teaches us that hell is a real place where unbelievers must go to after they die. It is a miserable place of endless torment with pains so unbearable that even one drop of water would seem like a big relief. Jesus also teaches us that hell is an eternal prison where there is no hope of improvement in conditions and no possibility of leaving.

    在23-26节中 ,我们对地狱有什么了解？耶稣教导我们地狱是不信的人死后必须去的真实的地方。它是经历无尽的痛苦煎熬的悲惨的地方，如此不堪忍受，甚至一滴水似乎能解脱极大的痛苦。耶稣还教导我们地狱是个没有希望改善状况，没有释放的可能的永远的监狱

    -vs.29 and 31 What is meant by “Moses and the Prophets”? Moses and the Prophets is the term used for the 39 books of the Old Testament. The Old Testament was the only part of God's Word that was recorded at the time Jesus lived and told this story. “Moses and the Prophets” refers to God's revealed Word that was given to people so that they could know God's will, learn about the Savior and come to a true, saving faith in God. In this story, Jesus teaches us that God is please to establish and preserve a saving relationship with Him by our use of and belief in His Word, and not through some miraculous experience we might demand of Him.

    在29和31节中， “摩西和先知”是什么意思？摩西和先知的说法用于指旧约的39本书。旧约是耶稣讲这个故事时当时唯一记录下的神的话语。“摩西和先知”特指神所启示的，赐给子民的话语，好让他们知道神的旨意，认识救主，归入神真正的，得救的信心里。在这个故事里，耶稣教导我们：神愿意我们通过使用和相信他的话语与他建立并保守救赎的关系，而不是靠我们向他要求的一些神迹奇事。
