### I. Expanded Planning For The Sermon 讲章计划的扩展

Once the basic planning of identifying a sermon goal with a theme and basic parts and deciding on the primary Law problem to address and Gospel solution to offer, we are ready to work on expanding our plan for the sermon. The aspects of this expanded plan will include:

一旦有了确定讲道的目的，主题，基本段落，以及要解决的律法问题和福音解决方案的计划，我们就开始扩展讲章的计划。扩展计划将包括以下部分：

A. Developing a orderly Detailed Outline for the sermon and 

为讲章发展一个有条理的具体大纲

B. Deciding on fitting Specific Content for the sermon

为讲章决定合适的详细的内容

### II. The Detailed Outline 具体大纲

A. The typical sermon in Chinese Christian churches lasts between 35-45 minutes. This compares with the average sermon in the United States that lasts about 20 minutes. The preacher in China will generally develop a sermon that includes 18-22 paragraphs that each will take about 2 minutes to preach.

典型的中国教会的一场讲道长达35-45分钟。与美国相比，普通的讲道长达大约20分钟。通常，中国的传道人要形成的一篇讲章包括18-22个段落，每个段落要讲述大约2分钟。

B. In preparing the Detailed Outline, the sermon writer will divide the basic parts he/she has developed into a series of orderly, subparts that will lead the hearer to understand and take hold of the main points of the message of God's Word and realize the primary faith or life goal（s） of the sermon. The preparation of the Detailed Outline is similar to drawing an easy-to-follow map to help a traveler reach a new destination.

在准备具体大纲时，讲章作者要将他/她形成的基本段落分成一系列的有条理的分段落，引导听众理解和把握神话语的信息的要点，并认识到该讲道要达到的主要的信心目的或生活目的。具体大纲的准备类似于画一张帮助游客到达一个新目的地的容易跟随的地图。

C. The subparts should follow a logical development that may begin with explanation of the text that eventually lead to applications of the Law and Gospel to the faith and/or life of the hearer.

分段落应该遵循一个合乎逻辑的发展，可以从解释经文开始，最终为听众的信心或生活引入律法与福音的应用。

D. In developing the Detailed Outline, the sermon writer will also plan the Introduction to the sermon. In the Introduction the preacher will want to get the attention and interest of the hearer and leading the hearer to learn the major theme of the sermon.

在形成具体大纲时，讲章作者也要为讲章准备一个引言部分。在引言中，讲道人要吸引听众的注意力和兴趣，引导听众了解讲道的主题。

E. In addition, the sermon writer will also plan the Conclusion to the sermon as part of the development of the Detailed Outline. The Conclusion is a very important part of sermon. It is the last part of the sermon that is heard. It should help the hearers review and grasp the main points of the sermon. The Conclusion should also direct the hearer's hearts and lives clearly and strongly in the truths that God wants them to believe and/or in the things He wants them to do.

另外，讲章作者也要为讲章准备结束语作为具体大纲的发展部分。结论部分是讲章的非常重要的部分。因为它是听众听到这篇讲道的最后一部分。它应该帮助听众回顾和抓住这篇讲道的主旨。结论部分也要引导听众的内心，并使他们清楚地，坚定地生活在神要他们相信的真理中，和做神要他们做的事情。

### III. Filling In The Specific Content For The Sermon 填写讲章的具体内容

A. Once the Expanded Outline has been prepared, the sermon writer is ready to add the background and context information, specific explanations, definitions, comparisons, illustrations, examples and applications that make the message of God's Word clearer for the people and more relevant to their lives.

一旦准备好扩展的大纲，讲道作者就要开始补充背景和上下文信息，具体的解释，定义，比较，例证，例子和应用，使神的话语的信息让信众更明白，与他们的生活更加密切相关。

B. A sermon writer can draw on a wide range of source for this material. For example, it may come from Biblical or non-Biblical material, from one's own life experience or from that of others, from information gained through observation, study or research, from both contemporary and historical events.

讲道作者可以吸收广泛资源。比如，可以来自圣经或非圣经的素材，来自自己的亲生经历或他人的经历，来自通过观察，学习，或研究获得的信息，来自当代或历史事件。

C. The sermon writer will want to make sure that the material he/she chooses is fitting for the hearers and communicates well to their life experience.

讲道作者要确信他/她所选择的材料是否适合听众，与他们的人生经历相融洽。

D. Once the sermon writer has successfully completed this step which requires much thought, he/she is well on the way to completing the sermon writing process.

一旦讲道作者经过深思熟虑已经成功地完成这一步，他/她就顺利踏上完成讲章撰写之旅。

### IV. Assignment 作业

A. Analyze the following sermon on Luke 14:25-33. Discover and write down the Expanded Outline points that you find. You will write one brief sentence for each paragraph of the sermon.

分析下面基于路加14:25-33经文的讲章。 找到并写下扩展大纲的要点。请为讲章的每一段落写下段落大意。

LORD, HELP US PAY THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP

主啊，请帮助我们付上做门徒的代价

Greeting: Jesus said: “Come, follow Me.”

问安：耶稣说：“来吧，跟随我。”

Luke 14:25-33

Text: 25） Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them He said: 26） “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters - yes, even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. 27） And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple. 28） Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? 29） For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, 30） saying, ”This fellow began to build a house and was not able to finish.“ 31） Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand me to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? 32） If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. 33） In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be My disciple.

路加福音 14:25–33 （CUV） 25 有极多的人和耶稣同行。他转过来对他们说：26 「人到我这里来，若不爱我胜过爱自己的父 母、妻子、儿女、弟兄、姊妹，和自己的性命，就不能作我的门徒。27 凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒。28 你们哪一个要盖一座楼，不先坐下算计花费，能盖成不能呢？29 恐怕安了地基，不能成功，看见的人都笑话他，说：30 『这个人开了工，却不能完工。』31 或是一个王出去和别的王打仗，岂不先坐下酌量，能用一万兵去敌那领二万兵来攻打他的吗？32 若是不能，就趁敌人还远的时候，派使者去求和息的条款。33 这样，你们无论什么人，若不撇下一切所有的，就不能作我的门徒。」

Introduction: People's attitudes toward the cost of things is an interesting subject. Years ago I read a letter that a customer of the natural gas company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin sent to explain why he was refusing to pay his bill. He wrote: ”I think it is wrong for you to charge me for natural gas. It was God who put the natural gas into the ground. not you.“ Of course, this man conveniently forgot that it cost the company quite a bit to extract the gas from the ground and transport it to his house so he could cook his food and heat his house. In another instance, I recall the time my grandparents' water pump broke on their farm. My uncle and I set aside everything else we were doing at the time and worked hard to find the problem, get the parts and stay with the project until it was done. God had freely put that well water into the ground, but we paid a fairly high cost in labor and money to make sure it was available to my grandparents and their animals. Some wonderful things such as natural gas or water are free gifts from God, yet there is a cost involved in having them available to us.

引言：人们对于事物的代价的态度是个有趣的话题。多年以前我读了来自威斯康辛州，密尔沃基天然气公司的消费者寄来的一封信，解释他为什么拒绝付账单。他写到：我认为你们向我收天然气费是不对的。是神把天然气放在地下，不是你们。”当然，这个人很随意地忘了是天然气公司花费很大代价将天然气从地底下开采出来，输送到他家中，因此他可以做饭，给屋子供暖。另一次，我记得我的祖父母家的水管在他们的农场破裂了。我舅舅和我放下其他正在做的事情，费了很大的劲查出了问题，弄来新部件，一直忙于这件事情直到问题得到解决。神无偿地把井水放在地下，但我们在人力物力上花了很高代价确保我的祖父母和他们的牲畜有水用。像天然气和水这样的美好的资源是神白白的恩赐，然而我们要想使用它们，就涉及到代价问题。

In the Gospel lesson for today, Jesus would have us understand something similar about the Christian faith and its costs. Some things about Christianity are entirely free to us and some other things about Christianity have a cost to them. Forgiveness, salvation and eternal life are things Jesus Christ earned by His perfect life and atoning death. Because of Jesus, God freely gives them to sinners who have need of them. On the other hand, to retain a faith relationship with Jesus can be costly. The Savior calls on us to renounce ourselves as the ones in charge of our lives, to devote all we are and have to Him and to endure anything for His sake. All those things carry a sometimes painful cost.

在今天的福音功课中，耶稣要我们明白关于基督徒信心及其代价有着相似的道理。基督信仰的有些东西完全是白白赐给我们的，而另一些东西需要付出代价。宽恕，救恩和永生是耶稣基督以他完美的生命和代替我们受死挣得的。因为耶稣，神将这些无偿地赐给需要它们的罪人。另一方面，要保持和耶稣之间信心的关系，其代价是昂贵的。救主呼召我们拒绝自我主宰的生命，将我们自己和我们所有的全然摆上奉献于他，为他忍受一切。为此有时要付上令人痛苦的代价。

As we think about our faith, Jesus wants us to consider those costs. In the Gospel lesson, He gives us two examples to help us think this through. The first example is that of a man who wants to build a house. Before he builds he should carefully estimate what it will take to build the house. He should think about the materials he will need and the resources he has available. If he is mistaken, he may start the house, but he may not be able to finish it. Then he will have no house to live in and no resources left. He may become the topic of other people's conversation and laughter for being foolish.

当我们想到信心时，耶稣要我们考虑那些代价。在这个福音功课中，他举了两个例子帮助我们思考。第一个例子是一个人想要建造房子。在他建造之前，他应该仔细估计建房子的花费。他应该考虑他需要的材料和他可以使用的物资。如果他搞错了，他可以开始建房，但他可能无法完成。那么，他不仅没有房子居住也没有剩余物资。他可能成为其他人谈论的话题，并嘲笑他的愚蠢。

The second example Jesus gives is that of a king in conflict with another nation. The tensions are high and war is a strong possibility. The king must carefully consider if he can defeat an enemy who outnumbers his forces 2-1. If so, he can go to battle and gain a victory. If not, it is better for him to seek terms of peace without the war. Jesus' point in both examples is that our efforts to do something will fail if we do not wisely and carefully consider the costs to us before we proceed. So today, I ask you the extremely serious question: “Are you ready to pay the price of being Jesus' disciple? Are you willing to bear the cost of being in a faithful believing relationship with Him?” This is not a cream-puff question that we should answer without contemplation. It is a hard question that requires soul-searching reflection and a most determined reply. May God help us all to give it that.

耶稣举的第二个例子是一个与另一个国家发生冲突的国王。局势紧张，战争在所难免。这个王必须仔细酌量他是否能打败人数超过他军队一倍的敌人。如果可以，他就能迎战和获胜。如果不行，他最好向敌军免战求和。在这两个例子里耶稣表明的是如果我们行动前没有智慧地、仔细地考虑我们要付出的代价，那么我们的努力将前功尽弃。因此，今天我问你们这个极其严肃的问题：“你准备好付上成为耶稣的门徒的代价了吗？”你愿意承担和他保持忠诚的信赖关系而付出的代价吗？“这不是一个我们不需要深思就能轻而易举地回答的问题。这是一个要求进行真挚的反思并做出最坚决答复的棘手问题。愿神帮助我们所有人做出回答。

Loving Jesus So Much That All Other Loves Seem Like Hatred

如此爱耶稣以致其他的爱看似憎恨

As we think about the cost of following Jesus Christ, we consider first what He tells us in verse 26: ”If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters - yes, even his own life - he cannot be My disciple.“ These are striking words. Jesus Christ is a preacher of love and not hatred. Yet, He talks to us about hating people. We want to understand what Jesus is doing with these words. Jesus is not advocating hatred for anyone. Here He is using a form of speech called ”hyperbole.“ Hyperbole is an exaggerated form of expression. He uses it to get our attention, to emphasize a point, and to get us thinking.

当我们思考跟随耶稣基督的代价时，首先我们考虑他在26节告诉我们：”人 到 我 这 里 来 , 若 不 爱 我 胜 过 爱 （ 爱 我 胜 过 爱 : 原 文 是 恨 ） 自 己 的 父 母 、 妻 子 、 儿 女 、 弟 兄 、 姐 妹 , 和 自 己 的 性 命 , 就 不 能 作 我 的 门 徒 .“这些话语出惊人。耶稣基督是爱而不是恨的传播者。然而，他告诉我们要恨人。我们想明白耶稣说这些话的意思。耶稣不是提倡恨任何人。这里他在使用”夸张“的修辞法。夸张是一种言过其实的表达方式。他以此来引起我们的注意，强调要点，使我们思考。

When Jesus tells us that those who follow Him must ”hate“ their family members and own self, He is stressing that our love for Jesus must be so great and so far ahead of other loves that our love for ourselves and those dear to us that it seems like hatred when we compare them. This is our duty: We are to love Jesus Christ so much that all our other loves - be it a love for parents, spouse, children, siblings, or self seem like hatred by comparison. God is to come first in our hearts and lives. All others - as important as they are - must come a very distant second.

当耶稣告诉我们那些跟随他的人必须”恨“他们的家人和自己时，他在强调我们对耶稣的爱必须如此强烈，远远超过其他的爱，以致当我们进行比较时，对自己和对我们亲爱的人的爱似乎像恨一般。这是我们的职责：我们要如此爱耶稣，以致所有其他的爱与其相比——对父母，配偶，儿女，弟兄姐妹，自己的爱就像恨一般。神在我们的心中和生活中是第一位的。所有其他人—尽管他们很重要——必须远远地居于第二位。

A professional baseball player, in his early 20s and single, took a strong interest in a young woman who occasionally attended his team's games. They started dating. The player noticed that every time, he asked her to stay out late for a date on Saturday nights, she always refused. She explained that she regularly attended church on Sunday mornings and wasn't going to miss. The young man accepted this, but didn't really understand her devotion to God. As their relationship grew, he reached a point where he became very angry because he realized that there was someone more important in his girlfriend's life than he was and he did not like that. He fumed about this for a while. Then he eventually accepted her long-standing invitation to find out about God for himself. So he attended church with her when he could. He studied the Bible with her. Over time, he came to faith in Jesus Christ himself. He came to understand why this women, who later became his wife, was so devoted to God. He discovered the tremendous love Jesus had for him.

一个职业棒球手，在他单身，20出头时，对一位偶尔参加他们队比赛的年轻姑娘非常感兴趣。他们开始约会。这位棒球手注意到每次要她周六晚约会晚点回去时，她总是拒绝。她解释星期天早晨她固定要参加教会礼拜，不能错过。这个年轻人接受了解释，但他没有真正明白她对神的投入。随着他们的关系发展。他变得很生气，因为他意识到在她女朋友的生活中还有比他更重要的人，他不喜欢这样。他对此恼怒了一段时间。然后他终于接受她长久以来的邀请，亲自认识这位神。于是他一有空就和她一起参加教会。他和她一起学习圣经。随着时间推移，他自己相信了耶稣基督。他终于明白为什么这位后来成他妻子的女士，对神如此投入。他也发现耶稣对他的极大的爱。

To love Jesus so much that all other loves seem like hatred. To willingly surrender our hearts to our Savior, to be thrilled to obey His will, to seek to honor and praise Him in all we do. Making the study of His Word, the worship of His name, the witness to His truth, the service to His cause the first things in life. To a person with a worldly point of view, this seems like such a burdensome waste of time and effort. But that is not so for the person who grasps the wonderful love Jesus Christ has for us.

如此爱耶稣以致其他的爱看似憎恨。甘愿把我们的心交给我们的救主，狂喜地顺服他的旨意，在我们所做的事情上努力尊荣和赞美他。学习他的话语，敬拜他的名，为他的真理作见证，把为主的大业服事作为生命中首要的事。对于一个带着属世观点的人来说，这似乎是对时间和精力的难以忍受的浪费。但对于一个体会到耶稣为我们付出的奇妙的爱的人来说不会这样。

Consider some of the ways God loves us. He loved people who should have always loved Him, but inexcusably chose not to. He sent His sinless Son to bear the full brunt of the penalty we deserved to suffer. He required Jesus to suffer the great torment of His fierce wrath without any relief until He had paid everything for our salvation.

考虑神爱我们的方式。他爱那些本应该爱神，但不可宽恕地选择不爱神的人。他差派他无罪的儿子承担我们应该遭受的全部刑罚。他要求耶稣毫无援助地承受他烈怒的极大痛苦，直到他为我们得救付上所有赎价。

God made and loves all creatures. Yet of all the creatures He has made, only human beings were given immortal souls and the ability to have a special, spiritual relationship with God. God made and loves the angels, Yet God did not send the angels who sinned a Savior to rescue them. But God did send one for us.

神创造并爱所有受造物。然而，所有受造物中，唯独赐给人类不朽的灵魂和与神建立特别的属灵关系的能力。神创造也爱天使，然而，神没有给犯罪的天使一个救主去拯救他们。但神真的为我们差派一位救主。

The depth of God's love for us defies reason, exceeds our ability to understand, and cannot be calculated. It is amazing, thrilling, overwhelming. God's great love for us in Jesus is our supreme, sufficient reason to love our Savior more and more, to love Him so much that all other loves in our life seem like hatred.

神对我们爱之深奥挑战我们的理性、超越我们的理解能力、无法测度。它是令人惊异、令人激动、难以抗拒的爱。神籍着耶稣对我们的伟大的爱给我们至高、充分的理由让我们越来越爱我们的救主，如此爱他以致我们生命中其他的爱看似憎恨。

Yielding All We Have So That Nothing Seems Like Our Own

放弃我们的所有以致我们似乎一无所有

Another part of the cost of being Jesus' disciple involves the way we regard the resources that God has entrusted to us. Jesus directs us to think about that cost when He says to us in verse 33: ”In the same way, if any one of you does not give up everything he has, he cannot be My disciple.“

做耶稣门徒的代价的另一个方面包括我们怎样看待神托付给我们的资源。耶稣带领我们思考这个代价，他在33节中说：”这 样 , 你 们 无 论 甚 麽 人 , 若 不 撇 下 一 切 所 有 的 , 就 不 能 作 我 的 门 徒 .“

The price Jesus requires of us to be His is to tear our hearts and all their affections and attachments away from our possessions. He demands that we renounce any idea that we actually own the things we have. He insists that we act in such a way that we believe that everything in our care is God's and not ours. The true state of things is that God is actually the absolute Owner of everything, including us. However, we do not often accept that truth and act that way. Consider that there is nothing we have that God did not give us to begin with. Our time and energy, our money and things, our ability to think and act, our bodies and souls - all of it comes from God. These things are entrusted to us to manage for Him. It is as if we are granted the power of attorney to act in the interest of our Lord and Savior, to carry out His wishes with the things at our use and disposal.

耶稣要求我们付的代价是要我们的心，以及心中对我们所拥有的一切的热爱与依恋决裂。他要求我们断绝任何我们真的拥有自己的东西的念头。他强调我们用行动显示我们相信我们管理的一切是神的而不是我们的。事情的真相是神实际上是万有，包括我们在内的绝对主人。然而，我们经常不接受这个事实，也不如此行。考虑我们拥有的一切没有一样不是神起初赐给我们的。我们的时间，能量，财物，我们思考和行为的能力，我们的身体和灵魂——所有一切来自于神。神将这些东西托付我们来管理。就好像为了我们的神和救主的利益，神赐给我们代理人的权柄来使用和安排这些东西去实现他的愿望。

Just think what it would it mean for us to consistently live in a way that we manage all that we have been given in the interest of God? It might well revolutionize and reconfigure our lives. If, how can I serve God with what I have been given, was the driving principle of your thoughts and actions, how would this affect the way you allocate your time? Would there be more for Bible study and prayer and less for mindless diversions? Would there be more time for caring for and helping others and less for the things that just waste time and drain our energies? If, how can I serve God with what I have been given, was the driving principle of your thoughts and actions, how would this affect the way you use your money? Would there be more for God's work and less for your personal overhead? Would there be more for charitable giving to people in genuine need and less for your questionable wants? Those are questions worth asking and answering from a Christ-in-the-center point of belief.

只需想一想如果我们一贯为了神的利益来管理神赐给我们的一切，这样生活对我们意味着什么？这很可能彻底改变和革新我们的生活。如果你把如何用神所赐给你的为神服事作为你思想和行动的驱动原则，这将怎样影响你如何分配你的时间？你会更多用于圣经学习和祷告，较少用于毫无意义的消遣吗？你会更多时间去关心和帮助别人，较少做只是浪费时间和消耗精力的事情上吗？如果你把如何用神所赐给你的为神服事作为你思想和行动的驱动原则，这将怎样影响你用钱的方式？你会更多用于神的事工，较少用于个人开销吗？你会更多用于慈善捐献给真正有需要的人，较少用于并非真正的需要上吗？从以基督为中心的信仰观看，这些都是值得提出和回答的问题。

This is not so easy for us because we have this battle with our sinful nature that is always pulling us in the direction of making sinfully, selfish choices. It is a hard and bitter fight, but it is not a hopeless one. We can pay the price of discipleship because Jesus gives us the ability to do so. The one who asks us to pay the cost to be His gives us the resources to pay it willingly and gladly. Jesus paid the far steeper cost of our redemption. The apostle Paul reminds us that Jesus ”emptied Himself, making Himself nothing, taking the form of a servant and became obedient to death, even the violent, accursed death on the cross. He became poor so that we could be rich in every way, especially in the ways that matter most, spiritually and eternally, heirs to the endless glorious blessings of eternal life with God.

对我们来说这并非易事，因为我们要和自己的罪性争战，我们的罪性总是把我们往做罪恶、自私的决定方向拉。这是一场艰难、痛苦的仗，但并非没有希望。我们可以付上门徒职分的代价，因为耶稣给我们这样的能力。这位要求我们为做他门徒付上代价的神赐给我们资源去甘心乐意地付上代价。耶稣为我们付上极高的赎价。使徒保罗提醒我们耶稣“反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形象，存心顺服，以至於死，且受暴力，咒诅死在十字架上。他成为贫穷以使我们在各方面能富足，尤其使我们在最重要的灵性上和永恒里的富足，使我们成为与神同在的永生里无尽荣耀的祝福的继承人。

Just as the water and the natural gas in the ground is free while the piping is expensive, so our salvation is free while our discipleship is costly. Jesus presents us with a radical teaching. But, we remember He is our radical Savior. He is radical in His love for us. He moves us and equips us to make a radical response. He will help us pay the cost of discipleship. He will help us love Him so much that all other loves seem like hatred. He will help us surrender all we have so that nothing seems like our own. Amen.

正如地上的水和天然气虽然免费，然而管道的代价是昂贵的，因此我们的救恩虽然是无偿的，但我们门徒职分的代价是昂贵的。耶稣给了我们一个不一般的教导。但是，我们记住耶稣是我们彻底的救主。他对我们的爱是彻底的。他驱使我们和装备我们做出彻底的回答。他将帮助我们付上门徒职分的代价。他将帮助我们如此爱他以致其他的爱看似憎恨。他将帮助我们放弃我们拥有的一切以致我们似乎一无所有。阿门。
