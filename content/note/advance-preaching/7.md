### I. Types Of Sermons 讲章类型

There are several basic types of sermons. We will briefly examine and distinguish between these various types.

讲章有几种基本类型。我们将简要的查考并区分这些不同的类型。

#### A. Topical Sermons 论题型讲章

Topical sermons primarily treat a subject （such as love or death or Baptism） rather than expound the message of a specific text.

论题型讲章主要针对一个主题（比如说爱、死亡或洗礼）而不是详细论述一处特定的经文。

#### B. Expository Sermons 释经型讲章

The word “expository” means “to explain something.” Expository sermons are different than topical sermons in that they focus on presenting and explaining the message of a biblical text in either a strict or loose fashion. There are several kinds of expository sermons.

“释经”这个词的意思是“讲解某事”.释经型讲章与论题型讲章的不同之处在于两者在讲解某处圣经经文时所采用的风格是严密的还是自由的。释经型讲章也可分为几类。

1. Textual Analytical 

    经文分析类

    The textual analytical sermon makes a strict use of the text. It uses the divisions of the text as they appear in their natural order under a carefully chosen theme. These sermons are very logical and are the easiest to design and follow.

    经文分析类的讲章严密的使用经文。它将按照经文所呈现出的自然段落来为每段经文仔细地确定出主题。这类讲章的逻辑非常清晰并且非常容易设计和理解。

2. Textual Synthetic 

    经文综述类

    The textual synthetic sermon also makes strict use of the text. It rearranges the divisions of the text from their natural order to allow for a more logical and better educational and theological treatment of the text. The synthetic sermon works best when the analytical approach will not work well to serve the hearers.

    经文综述类讲章同样是严密地使用经文。它重新排列原本的经文次序来对经文进行更合逻辑、更有教育意义和神学意义的论述。当经文分析式的方法不能很好的应用于听众时，经文综述类讲章有非常好的效果。

3. Homily

    布道

    The homily makes a rather loose and free use of the text. It generally gives a brief, summary exposition of the text with a large number of points to the sermon. The theme of the homily is more like a title which provides a descriptive, but not a logical unity to the parts of the sermon. A homily is like a running commentary of the text with applications made periodically through the sermon. It is the most difficult type of sermon to prepare well.

    布道类讲章以自由和宽松的方式来使用经文。它通常对经文做出简要、总结性的解释并多指向讲章本身。布道类讲章的主题更像是用来说明和叙述的小标题而不是讲章的逻辑构件。布道类讲章就像是在对经文连续不断的讲解中，间歇的穿插着应用。这种讲章类型是最难预备好的。
