His-story From Jesus Until Judgment Day
从耶稣时代到审判日的历史
When Jesus had finished earning us a clean record, He made His twelve trainees world-class missionaries. Their mission was to get the Word out. Then He disappeared into heaven to control life on this world and everywhere and support every one of His people on earth until judgment day.
当耶稣已经为我们赢得了无罪的记录，他使十二门徒成为世界级的传教士。他们的使命是传福音。然后耶稣消失，回到天堂，掌控这世界每处的生命，帮助这世界的每一个子民，直到审判日。

But first, a few things to remember about the end of the world.

10. Revelation outlines a series of visions about the ongoing war between Satan’s team and God’s team. There are seven groups of visions. They show each battle and its outcome. This is the same kind of picture language the Old Testament prophecy books use (for example, Ezekiel, Zechariah and Isaiah).

His-story From Right After Jesus
耶稣时代之后的历史
The Holy Spirit not only brings people to Jesus and a new relationship with God. He also helps them live for Jesus. He does even more. He also brings Christians together into a family.
圣灵不仅使人归向耶稣，使人和神有了新的关系，而且圣灵也使人们为耶稣活着。更多的是，圣灵使基督徒成为大家庭。
Acts 2:47 Every day the Lord saved people. He added them to the group of believers.
使徒行传 2:47 每天主拯救人们，并且把他们归于信徒大家庭。
1.Jewish Christians
1.犹太基督徒
Right after Jesus, most Christians were Jews living around Jerusalem. Then the authorities really came down hard on Christians. Believers had to relocate. Rather than hurting Christianity, it actually helped spread its message to new places.
耶稣之后的时代，多数基督徒是生活在耶路撒冷的犹太人。然后官府强力打压基督徒。信徒们不得不迁移他处。这没有损害基督教，反而帮助传福音到其他地区。
Acts 8:4 Wherever the believers were scattered, they told people the Good News.
使徒行传 8:4 那些分散的人，往各处去传道。
One of Christianity’s earliest enemies was Saul from Tarsus. He was an extreme Pharisee. He saw Christianity as a threat to the “true religion” of the Jews. Jesus personally appears to Saul. Saul has a total change of heart.
基督教最早的敌人之一是大数的扫罗。他是个极端的法利赛人。他认为基督教威胁到犹太人真正的宗教。耶稣向扫罗显现，然后他内心完全改变了。
Read Acts 9:1-9
阅读使徒行传 9:1-9
Saul starts calling himself Paul, which means “Tiny.” He becomes one of Christianity’s leading spokesmen. God had chosen him to bring the Message to non-Jewish people.
扫罗开始称自己保罗，意思是微小的意思。他成为了基督教的首席发言人之一。神拣选他，把福音传给非犹太人。
2. Non-Jewish Christians
2. 非犹太人基督徒
During Paul’s missionary travels, he runs into stiff opposition from Jews in what’s modern-day Turkey. Paul changes his focus to non-Jewish people. They were enthusiastic to get the news about Jesus. Here’s an example of the transition. It happens in Antioch, a city in what’s today’s central Turkey.
在保罗传教途中，他遭到了今天土耳其当地的犹太人的顽固反对。他后来把注意力转向非犹太人。他们迫切想听到耶稣的福音。以下是一个转变的例子。这发生在如今土耳其中部的城市安提阿。
Read Acts 13:44-46
阅读使徒行传13:44-46
Jesus’ outline of His mission strategy was happening just as He said it would:

使徒行传 1:8 但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力。并要在耶路撒冷，犹太全地，和撒玛利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Blood
从耶稣时代直到今天的历史。。。。血
No less than 10 bloody persecutions in the next 250 years. But the courage, and even joy, these Christians show as they suffer and die for Jesus makes a deep impression on other people. A lot of new people begin depending on Jesus. This is why people used to say, “The blood of the martyrs becomes the seed of the Church.”
接下来的250年发生了不少于10起血腥迫害。但是，那些为耶稣受罪，牺牲的基督徒表现出来的勇气，甚至是喜悦，给其他人留下了深刻的印象。很多人开始信靠基督。这就是为何人们说，“殉道者的鲜血成为了教会的种子。”
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . In-house Conflict
从耶稣时代直到今天的历史。。。。教会内部的争斗
Satan had been unsuccessful in destroying God’s work with persecutions from outside God’s family. Next he uses misleading teachers from within the church.
撒旦试图用来自于神的家庭之外的宗教迫害破坏神的工作，可是没有得逞。接下来撒旦用教会内部的误导人的教导者。
Arius denies that Jesus is 100% God. The Nicea convention rejects this heresy and agrees to the Nicean Creed. Part of it calls Jesus, “God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, Begotten, not made, of one being with the Father.”
阿里乌否认耶稣是100% 的神。尼西亚大会否认了这个异端邪说，对尼西亚信经达成一致。信经的一部分称耶稣“在万世之前，为父所生，从神出来的神，从光出来的光，从真神出来的真神，受生的，不是被造的，与父一体的；
Pelagius attacks the Bible’s teaching that people are born full of sin. He says that people can convert and save themselves. Athanasius defends the truth. He says that people are totally incapable of good on their own. He says that salvation happens because God gives us the opposite of what we deserve.
伯拉纠攻击圣经里说的人生来充满罪的内容。他说人可以靠自己信基督，拯救自己。亚塔那修辩解道：人完全不能靠自己变的无罪。救赎之所以发生，是因为神给了我们本来不应得到的对待。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Power
从耶稣时代到今天的历史。。。。。权力
God had outsmarted Satan again. The devil tries still another approach. Some ministers in influential cities wanted more power. People called them “bishops.” Then bishops fought for dominance. Two bishops emerged as the most powerful, the bishop at Rome and the bishop at Constantinople.
神的智慧又一次胜过了撒旦。魔鬼又尝试了另一种方法。有些在有影响力的大城市的牧师想要更多的权力。人们称他们为大主教。接下来大主教争夺统治权。有两个大主教是最为有影响力的，罗马大主教和君士坦丁堡大主教。
When both bishops wanted top honors, the church split. Now there were two church bodies (in 1054 A.D.) – The Greek Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The bishop of Rome calls himself “pope.” He said he is Peter’s successor and Jesus’ representative on earth. He claimed to be the visible head of all believers.
两个主教都要最高的荣誉，教会因此分裂了。现在有两个教会派别（在公元1054年）----希腊正教和罗马天主教会。罗马大主教自称教皇。他说自己是彼得的继任者和耶稣在世上的代表。他自称是所有信徒有形的领袖。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Darkness
从耶稣时代到今天的历史。。。。黑暗
As the power of the popes grew, so did counterfeit teachings. They began to dim the light of what Jesus had done. A deep darkness was beginning to settle over organized Christianity.
随着教皇权力的膨胀，那些假的教导也跟着增加。他们开始遮盖耶稣所做的事。一个大的黑暗开始降临到井井有条的基督教。
Church leaders told people to depend for their salvation not only on God’s grace in Jesus, but also on their own religious performance. Church leaders pictured Jesus to people, not as a loving Savior, but as a stern Judge. In short, it seemed as if the devil had succeeded in ruining Jesus’ family of believers.
教会领导者告诉人们不仅要靠神在基督里的荣耀获得拯救，而且也要靠自己的宗教行为表现。教会领导者没有把耶稣描绘成充满爱的救赎者，而是一个严厉的审判者。简而言之，似乎魔鬼已经成功破坏了耶稣的信徒大家庭。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Light
从耶稣时代到今天的历史-----光
But Jesus is in charge. He promised us, “All the powers of hell will not conquer My Church!” October 31, 1517, Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to the castle church of Wittenberg.
但是耶稣在掌权。他应许我们：“地狱的权力不会攻克我的教会。”在1517年10月31日，马丁路德在威登堡的城堡教堂钉了95个这样的声明。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Luther
从耶稣时代到今天的历史----路德
Martin Luther kept trying to find peace of mind in the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. Nothing worked. He got desperate enough to join a monastery. He was determined to earn a place in God’s heart and home. He still couldn’t find what he was looking for.
马丁路德一直努力从罗马天主教会的教义里找到内心的平安，可是没有效果。他很绝望，后来加入了一个修道院。他决心在神的心里和家里赢得一个位置。然而，他没有找到他寻求的东西。
Later, as a priest with a doctorate at the University of Wittenberg, he made an intense study of the Bible. He researched the Bible book of Romans. He found the truth which made him free, and millions through him: “God accepts people as holy by depending on Jesus, without looking at what they’ve done to obey God’s rules for living” (Romans 3:28).
后来，作为获得了博士学位的威登堡大学的牧师，他刻苦研习圣经，并研究了罗马书。他发现了可以使他获得自由的真理，并且之后的无数人也从中获得了自由，：“神让人称义是因信耶稣，不是因人如何遵从神的律法”。（罗马书 3:28）
“Then the whole Bible opened up to me and also heaven itself. Immediately, I felt as if I had been born all over again, as if I had found the open gate of paradise.” – Martin Luther
然后整个圣经向我展开了，天堂也向我展开了。一瞬间，我觉得似乎我又重生了。就像我发现了去天堂的门。-----马丁路德
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Reformation
从耶稣时代到今天的历史---革命
Luther was disturbed about the way people acted after they bought indulgences from a traveling monk named Tetzel. They believed they had purchased forgiveness of sins and didn’t need to change their minds or their way of living. This led Martin Luther to nail his 95 statements against the sale of indulgences to the castle church of Wittenberg in 1517.
人们在一个旅行的僧侣泰策儿那里买了赎罪券后，人们的行为方式令路德感到担心。人们相信他们已经买了赎罪券，罪可以被赦免，不用再改变想法或生活方式。这使得马丁路德在1517年把95个反驳销售赎罪券的声明钉在了威登堡的城堡教堂
Luther stood in front of the emperor, national leaders and church leaders. They didn’t give him an opportunity to defend his teachings. They simply told him to retract all he had said and written. His response: “Unless you use what the Bible says to convince me, I cannot and will not recant. Here I stand. I cannot do anything else. God help me! Amen.”
路德站在皇帝，国家领导和教会领导面前，他们没有给他机会辩护自己的教义。他们只是让他撤回自己所说和所写的，他的回答是：除非你用圣经里说的使我信服，我不能也绝不会认错。我就站在这里。不能做其他的事情。求神救我！阿门。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Books
从耶稣时代到今天的历史---书籍
Next, the authorities declared Luther a wanted man. Powerful friends hid him in a castle called the Wartburg. Here he began his monumental translation of the Bible into the German language. Luther published his Small Catechism to help parents teach their children. This booklet, that summarizes the Bible’s teachings, has been called “the gem of the Reformation.”
接下来，官方宣布路德是通缉犯。有权力的朋友把他藏在叫瓦特堡的城堡。在那里他开始了把圣经翻译成德文的不朽工作。路德发表了袖珍教义问答书帮助父母教育孩子。这本小册子，概括了圣经的教义，被称为宗教改革的珍宝。
Luther also composed a lot of hymns, among them the great, inspirational, Reformation hymn, “A Mighty Fortress is Our God.” The Lutheran church becomes known as the “Singing Church.” It still is today.
路德还创作了很多赞美诗。其中最好的，鼓舞人心的，宗教改革赞美诗是“神是我 强大的堡垒”。路德教会有“歌唱教会”的美称。今天依旧如此。
His-Story From Jesus Until Today . . . Position Papers
从耶稣时代到今天的历史---意见书
Meanwhile, the emperor was doing his best to suppress the spread of what Jesus has done. At a German congressional meeting in 1529 the “Lutherans” (a nickname their enemies gave them) protested their treatment. That’s where the name “Protestants” came from.
In 1530 at another congressional meeting in Augsburg, Lutherans present their position paper. It’s “Evangelical” (true to the Gospel). They call it the Augsburg Confession.
同时，皇帝竭尽全力镇压耶稣的福音的传播。在德国国会里（1529年），马丁路德的信徒（他们的敌人起的绰号）抗议自己的待遇。这就是后来新教徒名称的由来。
在1530年奥格斯堡的另一个国会会议，马丁路德的信徒呈上了意见书。它是福音派教会的，（忠于福音的）。他们称之为奥斯堡信条。
The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) is the third largest Lutheran church body in the United States. It includes 394,241 baptized people and 1,290 church families. Our national church family operates one of the largest parochial school systems in the United States:
