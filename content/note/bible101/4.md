第五课（Lesson Five）
LESSON FIVE
第五课
A CLOSE LOOK AT GOD! 近距离看神
Throughout Old Testament history God had promised that some day He’d send a Savior. Jesus came on schedule some two thousand years ago. He lived, died and came back to life to prove He’s the Liberator God promised. But who or what is He? Is He human? Is He an angel? Is He God?
在旧约里，神应许将在某天差派一个救赎者。耶稣在两千年前准时来了。他活着、死去、复活来证明他是神应许的解救者。但是，他是谁？他是什么？是人吗?是天使吗？是神吗？
The missionaries Jesus trained set out to tell the world that their Rescuer from sin had come. People had all kinds of questions about Jesus. So, throughout their writings, the apostles answered these questions about Jesus’ identity.
耶稣训练的传教士开始告诉世人，他们罪的救赎者已经到来。人们对于耶稣，有很多问题，因此，藉着书信，使徒们回答了关于耶稣是谁的问题。
Who was Jesus?
耶稣是谁？
Hebrews 1: 1-14 The Holy Spirit used the book of Hebrews to let readers know Jesus is bigger than angels. Look at verses 7-14. Jesus is not an angel!
希伯来书1: 1-14 圣灵用希伯来书让读者知道，耶稣比天使要大。阅读7到14节。耶稣不是天使。
John 1: 1 The Holy Spirit gave us John’s Gospel around 90 A.D. He explained who Jesus really is and why He came. John confirms Jesus' deity. Jesus is 100% God!
约翰福音 1:1 圣灵在公元90年时，把约翰福音带给世人。约翰解释了耶稣真正是谁，以及为何而来。约翰确认了耶稣的神性。耶稣100%是神。
John 1: 14 John says, "He became human." Other parts of the Bible go into detail. They show Him growing physically, hungry and eating, crying real tears, getting tired and sleeping, feeling physical pain (Matthew 4:2; John 19:28; Mark 4:38; John 11:35; Matthew 26 and 27). Jesus is 100% human!
约翰福音 1:14 约翰说，“他道成肉身。”其他圣经章节进行了详细描述。这些章节展现了耶稣的身体如何成长，他感到饥饿，他也吃饭，他流泪痛哭，他感到累，他也睡觉，他也感受到身体的苦痛。（马太福音 4:2，约翰福音 19:28，马可福音 4:38；约翰福音 11:35；马太福音26章和27章） 耶稣100%是人。
Acts 1:10-11 Jesus is still 100% human. Everyone will be able to see for themselves one day.
使徒行传1:10-11 耶稣仍旧是100%的人。每个人有天都会自己看到这个。
How could Jesus be 100% human and 100% God at the same time?
耶稣怎么可以同时既完全是人，又完全是神呢？
The Bible doesn’t give an explanation. God says it. We believe it. That settles it. Deuteronomy 29:29 gives perhaps the best answer.
圣经没有解释。神说是这样的。我们就相信。这就是解决办法。申命记 29:29 或许给了最好的回答。
If Jesus is God, then who is the Father?
如果耶稣是神，那么谁是圣父？
John 20:17 Jesus called the Father, God. The Father is 100% God.
约翰福音20:17 耶稣称天父为神。天父100%是神。
How could Jesus and the Father both be God?
耶稣和天父如何都是神呢？
The Bible doesn’t give an explanation. God says it. We believe it. That settles it. Remember Deuteronomy 29:29.
圣经没有解释。神说了，我们就相信，这就是解决办法。记着申命记29:29。
If Jesus and the Father are God, then who is the Holy Spirit?
如果耶稣和天父是神，那么圣灵是谁呢？
Acts 1:4-9 He is “the Spirit” that Jesus promised to send. He is in charge of publicity, getting the message out and seeing that people understand it.
使徒行传 1:4-9 他是耶稣应许差来的灵。他负责宣传，传播信息，确保人们理解。
Acts 2:1-4 The Holy Spirit came on a special mission during the Jewish Pentecost holiday. (This happened ten days after Jesus' disappeared to heaven.)
使徒行传2:1-4 在犹太五旬节时，圣灵为一个特殊的使命而降临。（这发生在耶稣复活升天后的第十天。）
Acts 5: 1 -1 1 Peter said Ananias was guilty of lying to the Holy Spirit. Verses later he repeated this but says that Ananias lied to God. The Holy Spirit is 100 % God!
使徒行传5: 1 -1 1 彼得说，亚拿尼亚人因为向圣灵撒谎，犯了罪。后面的章节里彼得重复了这件事，却说亚拿尼亚向神撒了谎。（所以）圣灵100%是神。
How could Jesus, the Father and the Holy Spirit each be 100% God?
耶稣，圣父，圣灵如何能够各自都100%是神呢？
1+1+1=1. The Bible doesn’t give an explanation. God says it. We believe it. That settles it. “Making sense of it” means we have misunderstood it.
1+1+1=1. 圣经没有解释。神说了，我们就相信，这就是解决办法。“让这合符道理” 意味着，我们已经误解了。
Are there three Gods?
有3个神吗？
Deuteronomy 6:4 No. 1+1+1=1 is God’s math. There is only one God.
申命记 6:4 不。1+1+1=1 是神的数学。只有一个神。
Matthew 28:19-20 God's name includes all three Persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit. (See also 2 Corinthians 13:14)
马太福音28:19-20 神的名字包括三个位格-----圣父，圣子，圣灵。（见哥林多后书13:14)
THERE ARE THREE PERSONS WHO ARE EACH GOD.
THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD!
有三个位格，每个都是神。只有一个神。
There are three official statements about what Christians believe about the only real God – the Triune God!
有三个正式的陈述来描述 基督徒信的唯一真神---三位一体的神。
The Apostles' Creed (100 AD)
使徒信经 （公元100年）
I believe in the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
我信上帝，全能的父，创造天地的主。
我信主耶稣基督，上帝的独生子；
因着圣灵感孕，从童贞女马利亚所生；
在本丢彼拉多手下受难，被钉在十字架上，受死，埋葬；
降在阴间；第三天从死里复活；
他升天，坐在全能父上帝的右边；
将来必从那里降临，审判活人、死人；
我信圣灵；
我信神圣大公教会；我信圣徒相通；
我信罪得赦免；
我信身体复活；
我信永生。阿们！
The Nicene Creed (325-380 AD)
尼西亚信经 （公元325—380年）
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation He came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of thevirgin Mary and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried. And the third day He rose again in accordance with the Scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. And He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead, whose kingdom will have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets. And I believe in one holy Christian and apostolic Church, I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins, and I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.
我信独一上帝，全能的父，创造天地和有形无形万物的主，我信独一主耶稣基督，上帝的独生子，在万世以前为父所生，出于神而为神，出于光而为光，出于真神而为真神，受生，而非被造，与父一体，万物都是借着祂造的。为要拯救我们世人，从天降临，因着圣灵，并从童贞女马利亚成肉身，而为人。在本丢•彼拉多手下，为我们钉于十字架上，受难，埋葬。照圣经第三天复活。并升天，坐在父的右边。将来必有荣耀再降临，审判活人死人，祂的国度永无穷尽。我信圣灵，赐生命的主，从父和子出来，与父子同受敬拜， 同受尊荣，他曾借众先知说话。我信独一神圣大公使徒的教会。我认使罪得赦的独一洗礼。我望死人复活。并来世生命。阿们！
Can we worship, love and praise a God we can't comprehend?
我们能敬拜，爱戴和颂扬一个我们都不能理解的神吗？
