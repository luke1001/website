LESSON THREE

第三课
Old Testament History
旧约历史
Homework:作业
Read what Missionary Paul said when he visited a Jewish synagogue in Acts 13:13-41. As you read it, compare his train of thought with the diagram of the Old Testament History here in lesson three. Notice how the Holy Spirit led Paul to explain that the Old Testament is the book that promises Jesus to His ancestors.
阅读使徒行传里13:13-41传教士保罗在拜访犹太教会时候所说的话。阅读时，对比下图旧约历史的图表和他的思路。注意圣灵是如何引导保罗解释说明，旧约就是应许耶稣基督给他的祖先的经书。
