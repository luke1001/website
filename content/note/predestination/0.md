帖撒罗尼迦后书2：13-14 “13主爱的弟兄们哪，我们本该常为你们感谢神，因为他从起初拣选了你们，叫你们因信真道，又被圣灵感动，成为圣洁，能以得救。14神籍我们所传的福音召你们到这地步，好得着我们主耶稣基督的荣光。”

###### E. The Bible Teaching Of Election/Predestination 圣经对拣选/预定的教导

1. Definitions: 定义:

    a. Election/Predestination = “God’s act of choosing a certain number of people from among all sinners to come to saving faith in Christ and enjoy everlasting life with Him. God made this choice from eternity before creation and only because of His undeserved love and the redeeming work of Jesus Christ. He carries out this choice in time by calling, converting and keeping these individuals in faith through the Gospel in Word and Sacraments throughout their life and, finally, by bringing them to eternal glory.”

    拣选/预定—是神从所有的罪人中选出一定数量的人来信靠耶稣基督，享受永生的行为。源于祂无比的爱，和耶稣基督的救赎之功，神在创始之前就在永恒里作了选择。神籍着祂话语中的福音信息和祂所立之圣礼，在祂所定的时间，对所拣选的基督徒，通过呼召、使他们被改变（悔改）、并保守他们一生中的信心，最终，通过将他们带到永恒的荣耀，来完成这一选择。

    b. Election/Predestination = “the eternal act of God with respect to all who are saved, by which, out of pure grace and for Christ’s sake, He purposed to endow them in time with the spiritual blessings of conversion, justification, sanctification and preservation unto life eternal.” (John Mueller, Christian Dogmatics)

    拣选/预定 ----“是神对所有得救的人施行的永恒举动。这一举动完全是出于他的恩典和耶稣基督的缘故，主动按时赐给他们转变（悔改）、称义、成圣和保守他们在永生里的属灵祝福。” ----约翰 牧勒（John Mueller），《基督徒教理神学》

    c. Election/Predestination = “God’s act of choosing people from eternity to believe in Jesus Christ; this faith is worked and preserved in the elect through the gospel and sacraments.” (Lyle Lange, God So Loved The World)

    拣选/预定---是神从永恒中选择人相信耶稣基督的行为；这一信心是通过福音和圣礼作成并得以保持的。 ----莱尔 郎（Lyle Lang）, 《神爱世人》

    d. Election/Predestination = “If we want to think or speak correctly and usefully about eternal election, or the predestination or preordination of God’s children to eternal life, we should think or speak abut how God’s counsel, purpose and ordination in Christ Jesus – who is the true Book of Life – is revealed to us through the Word. In other words, the entire teaching about God’s purpose, counsel, will, and ordination belongs to our redemption, call, justification, and salvation. They should be treated together the way Paul treats them and has explained this article (Romans 8:29-30; Ephesians 1:4-10) and as Christ treated it in the parable of Matthew 22:1-14; namely, that God in His purpose and counsel ordained the following:

    拣选/预定---“如果我们想以正确而且有用的方式去思考或讲解有关神对他儿女的永恒选召、预定或命定，我们应该思考或讲解在神话语中已启示给我们的神在基督耶稣（他是真正的生命之书）里的计划，目的和安排是怎样的。换句话说，有关神计划、目的、旨意和安排的所有教导都属于我们的救赎、呼召、称义和拯救。我们对待它们的方式应该与保罗对待它们的方式一样（保罗在罗马书8：29—30；以弗所书1：4-10中也做过解释。）；也应该像基督在马太福音22：1-14的比喻中一样对待； 也就是说，神在他的目的、计划中预定了以下的事情：

    1. The human race is truly redeemed and reconciled with God through Christ. By His faultless obedience, suffering, and death, Christ merited for us the righteousness that helps us before God and also merits eternal life.

    通过基督，人类真正被救赎，而且得以与神和好。因着基督无瑕疵的顺服、受难和死亡，他为我们在神前赢得了公义，也因此为我们赢得永恒的生命。

    2. Such merit and benefits of Christ are presented, offered, and distributed to us through His Word and Sacraments.

    基督为我们赢得的这些福分是通过他的话语和圣礼得以显明、呈献并且分送给我们的。

    3. By His Holy Spirit, through the Word, when it is preached, heard and pondered, Christ will be effective and active in us, will convert hearts to true repentance and preserve them in the true faith.

    通过圣灵，籍著神的话语，当这些话语被传讲，被听见而且被默想的时候，基督在我们里面就会有效且活跃，就会让内心转变而真正悔改，并且保守他们真正的信心。

    4. The Spirit will justify all those who in true repentance receive Christ by a true faith. He will receive them into grace, the adoption of sons, and the inheritance of eternal life. (Galatians 3:19)

    那些真正悔改而接受基督的人，圣灵就籍着他们真正的信心使他们称义。他要接他们进入恩典，接纳他们为儿子，并且承受永生的产业。（加拉太书3：19）

    5. He will also sanctify in love those who are justified, as St. Paul says (Ephesians 1:4).

    如使徒保罗所说，那些称为义的人，他又在爱中使他们成圣。（以弗所书1：4）

    6. He also will protect them in their great weakness against the devil, the world and the flesh. He will rule and lead them in His ways (Deuteronomy 8:6), raise them again when they stumble (Proverbs 4:11-12), comfort them under the cross and in temptation (2 Corinthians 1:3-5), and preserve them for life eternal (John 12:25).

    他也将在他们软弱的时候保护他们抵挡那恶者、世界和肉体。他将以他的方式治理、带领他们（申命记8：6），在他们跌倒的时候将他们扶起，（箴言4：11-12），在患难以及受试探时安慰他们（哥林多后书1：3-5），并且保守他们持定永生（约翰福音12：25）

    7. He will also strengthen, increase, and support to the end the good work that He has begun in them (Philippians 1:6), if they cling to God’s Word, pray diligently, abide in God’s goodness, and faithfully use the gifts they received (Matthew 25:14-30).

    对于他已经开始的善工，他也将继续坚固，加增，支持直到末了（腓立比书1：6），只要他们持守神的话语，不住地祷告，信守神的良善，忠实地使用他们接收到的恩赐（马太福音25：14-30）

    8. Finally, He will eternally save and glorify in life eternal those whom He has elected, called and justified.
    
    God has prepared salvation not only in general in this counsel, purpose, and ordination. In grace He has considered and chosen to salvation each and every one of the elect who are to be saved through Christ. He has also ordained that in the way just mentioned He will, by His grace, gifts, and efficacy, bring them to salvation. He will aid, promote, strengthen, and preserve them. (Formula of Concord, Solid Declaration, Article XI, 13-238、)
    
    最后，那些被神拣选、呼召、称义的人，神又永远地拯救，并在永恒的生命中使他们得荣耀。

    在这个计划、旨意和预定中，神不只是预备了总体的救赎，出于恩典，他还考虑并预备了给每一个将藉着基督得救被拣选的人单个救赎。因着他的恩典、礼物和大能，透过耶稣基督，神还将带领他们进入救赎。他将帮助、鼓励，坚固、保守他们。 ----《协和信条》，完整宣言，十一条，13-238款

2. The doctrine of election/predestination is an important teaching of the Bible. It is not a “fundamental” doctrine, that is, it is not a central article of faith that a person must know and believe in order to be saved. It is a teaching that rests on the foundational doctrine of justification by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. The doctrine of election is not an “open question” that is unclear; nor is it an “optional” doctrine that a person can feel free to despise and reject.

    拣选/预定的教义是圣经的一项重要教导。它不是一个“基要”教义，也就是说，它不是一个必须要知道且相信才能得救的中心信条。它是以因信耶稣基督靠恩典得称义的基本教义为基础的。然而，它既不是一个不清楚的悬而未答的问题，也不是一个可以轻视或拒绝的“没必要”的教义。

3. The doctrine of election/predestination is a teaching of the Gospel (God’s gracious, saving will), not a teaching of the Law (God’s holy, moral will).

    拣选/预定的教义不是一个律法的教导（神圣洁、公义的旨意），而是一个福音的教导（神恩典和拯救的旨意）。

4. The doctrine of election/predestination concerns and applies only to Christians who are eternally saved. It does not apply to non-Christians. It does not apply to “temporary believers” who believe in Christ for a while, but then fall away and do not return to and remain in faith.

    拣选/预定的教义只涉及并应用在得着永恒拯救的基督徒身上。它不应用于非基督徒。它也不用于“暂时的信徒”—他们只短暂地相信基督，后来离弃神，而且再也没有回转相信的人。

###### F. The Value And Proper Use Of The Teaching Of Election/Predestination 拣选/预定教导的价值和正确的应用

1. God intends that the doctrine of election/predestination be a most comforting, strengthening and inspiring teaching to benefit His believers in Christ, especially in their times of spiritual challenge and weakness. Through this teaching, God would lead His believers to

    神的心意是让信仰基督的人从拣选/命定的教义中得益处，尤其当他们出于属灵的挑战和软弱时，能给他们带来最安慰、最有力的激励。透过这个教导，神要引导他的信徒：

    a. Have a greater personal assurance of their salvation

    对他们的救赎在个人内心有更大的确信

    b. Better understand how much God desires their salvation

    更好地理解神多么期待他们得救恩

    c. Be confident that God will preserve them in faith against all spiritual enemies

    能够确信，在面对一切属灵仇敌的攻击时，神将保守他们的信心。

    d. Give God all credit and glory for their salvation

    对于自己的救赎，将一切的功劳和荣耀归给神。

    e. Disregard their own worthiness or works as the reason for their salvation

    不再认为得救是因为自己的功劳或作为。

    f. Encourage them to continue to make life-long, faithful use of the means of grace.

    鼓励他们一生都能信实地使用神的施恩具。

    g. Strengthen them to bear up patiently under trials

    在面对磨难时，给他们添加力量，使他们能耐心地承受，不灰心。

    h. Inspire them to serve God and others zealously by confessing their faith and performing other good works.

    激励他们公开承认自己的信仰，并以善事来热心服事神和他人。

2. God does not intend that this doctrine lead people into a sense of false security and presumption in which people become indifferent to living a diligent, obedient sanctified life and also neglect the faithful, believing use of the Gospel in Word and Sacraments.

    神不希望这个教义导致人产生一种错误的安全感，误以为再不需要过一个勤勉、顺服的圣洁生活。也不希望人因此忽略忠实地、照真正信心而使用神的道（圣经）和圣礼中的福音信息。

3. God does not intend that this doctrine lead people to become self-righteous and think of their salvation as something that they contribute toward or achieve by their own efforts.

    神不希望这个教义使人变得自以为义，误以为他们的救赎有自己的功劳，或是靠自己的努力取得的。

4. God does not intend that this doctrine leads people into doubt, worry, and/or despair regarding their salvation.

    神不希望这个教义让人因此对自己的救赎产生怀疑，担忧，或者绝望。

5. The doctrine of election/predestination is not intended to help the person who does not understand and believe the Gospel and wonders whether God loves them and will forgive and save them. In cases like this, we are to point people to the redeeming and justifying work of Jesus Christ and what He has done to save sinners.

    拣选/预定的教义不是要帮助那些不明白、不相信福音的人。这些人还不清楚神是否爱他们，将要赦免和拯救他们。在这种情况，我们就要让他们清楚耶稣基督救赎和称义的作为,明白他为了拯救罪人而付出的行动.

6. The doctrine of election/justification is intended for believers who already know and believe that God loves them and has saved them through Jesus Christ. This teaching assures that Christian that his/her coming to faith was not a matter of chance or an accident, but that it was because of God’s eternal plan and purpose that He is carrying out now in time and will complete by bringing the Christian to eternal glory in heaven.

    拣选/预定的教义是为信徒预备的。他们已经知道而且相信神爱他们，并且已经通过耶稣基督拯救了他们。这个教导使基督徒确知，他能够相信神不是出于偶然或碰巧，而是因为神永恒的计划和目的。神在他的时间里将计划正付诸实施，将以带领基督徒进入天国永远的荣耀来完成这个计划。

###### G. False, Damaging Views Of Election/Predestination 有关拣选/预定的错误、有害的观点

A number of false teachings have arisen about the doctrine of election/ predestination. These false views distort and attack the true biblical teaching God has given. These false views are inspired by the devil and develop from the sinful minds of people who let their reason interfere with the revelation of God’s Word. In their rebellious presumption, they presume to understand mysteries that God has kept hidden from humans and then attempt to harmonize them so that they make sense to human reason. By doing this they contradict clear teachings of God and damage the spiritual lives of others.

有关拣选/预定的教义已经出现不少错误的教导。这些错误的观点扭曲并且攻击神赐给人的真正圣经教训。这些错误的观点是出于撒旦，而且在人罪恶的意念中得到发展—人允许自己的理性扰乱神话语的启示。他们悖逆地妄想自己能明白神向人隐藏的奥秘，然后试图将之调和，以符合人类的理性。他们这样的做法与神清楚的教导想抵触，而且也破坏了他人属灵的生命。

###### Here are the main false views: 下面是几个主要错误观点：

1. God’s election consists of appointing the Gospel in Word and Sacraments as the means of grace so that people have the possibility of salvation. This view contradicts the Bible’s teaching that God actually elects/chooses individuals to come to salvation.　

    神的拣选是这样组成：神指定福音和圣礼作为恩典的途径来使人可以得救。这种观点与圣经的教导相违背，因为神实际拣选／选择了个人来得救恩。

2. God’s election of people is due to some good quality or worthiness within them that God foresaw and used as the basis for His choice of them. This is the false teaching of synergism, the faulty belief that people can and do contribute something to their salvation. It contradicts the Bible’s teachings that people are spiritually dead and powerless in sin and that salvation is by God’s grace alone in Christ. It promotes a “save yourself” work righteous view that will lead people to think that they can earn God’s favor and blessing.

    神对人的选择是因为神预先看到了人里面的一些好品质或优点，并以此为基准进行选择。这是协作论的错误教导，错误地相信人能够而且确实为自己的得拯救做些事情。这与圣经的教导相抵触—人在罪中是灵里死亡且毫无能力的人，得到拯救完全是神通过基督赐给人的恩典。它导致一种“拯救自己”、凭作工称义的观点，最终导致人认为他们可以赚得神的恩惠和祝福。

3. God’s election of people is due to the fact that God foresaw that some would believe in Christ and others would not, and on that basis, chose whom He would save. This is the false teaching of James Arminius. It is a form of synergism and a denial of original sin similar to point 2. An unfortunate misrepresentation of a poorly worded statement made by the Lutheran theologian John Gerhard who spoke of “election in view of faith” led to a bitter and divisive controversy in Lutheranism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

    神对人的拣选是因为这样一个事实—神预见一些人会相信基督，另一些人不会。在此基础上，神选择了那些他要拯救的人。这是詹姆斯-亚米纽斯 （James Arminius）的错误教导。它也是协作论的一种形式，与第二点相似，否认人的原罪。 不幸的是，对路德宗神学家约翰-葛哈德 （John Gerhard）的“鉴于信心的拣选”—一个措辞拙劣的陈述，所给予的错误阐释，在19世纪末与20世纪初曾导致了路德宗的尖锐分歧和争议。

4. God’s election is two-fold. In His sovereign freedom, God chooses some to come to faith in Christ and be saved. God also chooses the others to remain in unbelief and be damned. This is the false teaching of double predestination promoted by John Calvin which attributes contradictory wills to God. It opposes the Bible’s teachings of universal grace and of God’s will that all people be saved and none be lost. It promotes either a false confidence that leads people to think that it is impossible for them to be lost no matter what they do or an uncertainty or despair that leads people to think that there is no certainty or possibility of them being saved.

    神的拣选是两部分的。神在他至高的自由中，选择了一些人来相信基督得拯救。神也选择了另一些人让他们不信遭灭亡。这是法国神学家约翰-加尔文“双重命定”的错误教导。他认为神具有自相矛盾的意愿。这与圣经的普世恩典的教导、以及神的心意是要所有的人都得救、不愿一人沉沦的真理相违背。它造成两种结果，要么让人产生错误的自信，以为他们无论做什么都不会再次失丧；要么让人不确定、甚至绝望，认为他们没有把握自己是否会得救，或者有得救的可能。

As we deal with the doctrine of election/predestination we must resist the temptation to make the teachings of the Bible pleasing or acceptable to limited human logic or reason. We must also resist the temptation to presume to know the things that belong to God’s hidden will. We must respect God’s revealed will in the Bible as the only reliable Source of our faith and humbly accept and follow the teachings that God has revealed to us even if they appear to us to be incomplete or in conflict with each other and we have trouble understanding them.

在我们面对拣选/预定的教义时，我们必须拒绝这样的诱惑---那就是让圣经的教导取悦、或者适应人的有限逻辑或理性。我们也必须拒绝另一个诱惑—假想自己知道属于神的隐藏旨意的事情。我们必须尊重神在圣经中显明给我们的旨意，把它作为我们信心的唯一可靠来源，并且谦卑地接受并遵从神已经向我们显明的教导——即使它们似乎看起来不完整，或者彼此冲突，让我们难以理解。

###### H. Questions Related To Eternal Election/Predestination 永恒拣选/预定的相关问题

The doctrine of election/predestination both answers and suggests a number of questions for people to consider. Formulate a biblical answer to the following questions:

拣选/预定的教义既回答又提出了一些问题让人们思考。请为下面的问题给出圣经的答案：

1. On what basis did God choose people to come to faith in Christ and reach heaven?

    神基于什么来拣选人相信基督进入天堂？

2. For what reasons did God elect or predestinate people to be saved?

    神拣选/预定人得救恩是因为什么原因？

3. How does a person know if he/she is one of the elect?

    一个人怎样知道他/她是被拣选者之一？

4. If God wants everyone to be saved, why didn’t God elect everyone to salvation?

    如果神想让每一个人得救，他为什么不拣选每一个人来得救恩？

5. If God chose some to be saved, isn’t it logical to assume that God then chose the rest to be damned?

    如果神选择一些人得救，那么他就选择了其余的人灭亡，这样的假想不符合逻辑吗？

6. If God sincerely desires and works for the salvation of all people, then, doesn’t it make sense to assume that the reason some are saved and others are lost is that the people who are saved are, in some way, more deserving to be saved?

    如果神真地期望所有人得救，并且为所有人的得救作出努力，那么，一些人得救而另一些人失丧的原因在于，那些得救的人从某个方面来说，比那些没有得救的人更配得到拯救，这样的猜测难道没有道理吗？

7. Why do some people receive God’s grace in saving faith, while others reject it?

    为什么一些人接受神因信得救的恩典，而另一些人反对？

8. Can a person who believes in Christ and then falls from faith still be one of the elect and go to heaven?

    一个人相信了基督，但后来又不信了。这个人能不能仍然是被拣选的人之一，而且进入天堂？

9. How can the assurance that God has elected/chosen me to believe in Christ from eternity help me as I face difficulties and challenges in life?

    确信神已经在永恒里拣选了我来相信基督，这在我面对生活的困苦和挑战时，会对我有什么帮助？

10. If I am not sure that I am sorry for my sins or forgiven for them, does this mean that I am not one of God’s elect?

    如果我不肯定我是否为我的罪懊悔，也不肯定我的罪是否得到了饶恕，这是否就意味着我不是神要拣选的人之一？

11. If God elected people for salvation and did not elect any for damnation, how do we explain Romans 9:18 which says: “Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden?”

    如果神只拣选人来得救恩，而没有拣选人得诅咒，我们怎样解释罗马书9：18的经文：“如此看来，神要怜悯谁，就怜悯谁；要叫谁刚硬，就叫谁刚硬。”？

12. If God elected people only for salvation and did not elect any for damnation, how do we explain Romans 9:22-23 which says: 22) “What if God, choosing to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the objects of His wrath – prepared for destruction? 23) What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the objects of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory.”

    如果神只拣选人来得救恩，而没有拣选人得诅咒，我们怎样解释罗马书9：22-23的经文：“22 倘若神要显明他的忿怒，彰显他的权能，就多多忍耐宽容那可怒预备遭毁灭的器皿。23 又要将他丰盛的荣耀，彰显在那蒙怜悯早豫备得荣耀的器皿上。”？
