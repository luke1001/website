### I. Jesus’ Resurrection (John 20:1-18) 耶稣的复活（约翰20:1-18)）

#### A. The empty tomb (1-9) 空坟墓 (1-9)

1. We believe the Bible is God’s Word so it is without error. Some Bible critics claim the Bible contains many errors. One example they point to is that John records Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early on the first day of the week. Matthew wrote that another Mary accompanied her. Mark recorded the two Marys’ went to the tomb along with Salome. Luke records Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, Joanna and other women went to the tomb. How would we answer this alleged discrepancy? 

    我们相信圣经是神的话语，因此是正确无误的。有些圣经批评者称圣经包含很多错误。他们指出的一个例子是：约翰记录抹大拉的马利亚在七日的第一日清早去了坟墓。马太记录另一个马利亚和她同去。马可记录两个马利亚和撒米罗同去。路加记录抹大拉的马利亚，雅各的母亲马利亚，约亚拿和其他妇女去了坟墓。我们怎样回答这些记录上的所谓不同呢？

2. Mary arrived at the tomb and found it empty. What assumption did she make?

    马利亚来到坟墓，发现是空的。她的设想是什么？

3. What evidence did Peter and John find when they arrived at the tomb?

    当彼得和约翰来到坟墓时，他们发现什么证据？

4. How do the disciples’ findings at the tomb support our faith?

    门徒们在坟墓的发现怎样支持我们的信心？


5. John records that he saw the empty tomb and he believed. Yet he also records in verse 9 that both he and Peter were still struggling to understand what they had just witnessed. What didn’t they fully understand?

    约翰记录他看见了空坟墓，并且相信了。然而在第9节他也记录他和彼得仍然难以理解他们刚刚目睹的一切。他们没有完全理解什么？

6. Jesus told his followers several times that he would rise from the dead on the third day. How could nearly everyone have forgotten about Jesus’ prophecies about his resurrection?

    耶稣多次告诉他的跟随者他第三天将从死里复活。怎么会几乎所有人都忘了他对于他复活的预言呢？


#### B. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene (10-18) 耶稣向抹大拉的马利亚显现(10-18)

1. Mary stayed behind at the tomb after the disciples left. She saw two angels as she looked in the tomb. What concern did both the angels show toward Mary in her grief?

    马利亚在门徒离开后留在坟墓。她往坟墓里看时看见了两个天使。这两个天使怎样向悲伤的马利亚表达关心？

2. Mary’s grief was so intense that she apparently didn’t recognize the angels for who they were. How does our grief or difficulties sometimes keep us from seeing the obvious promises from God?

    马利亚的悲伤如此强烈以致她显然没有意识到他们是天使。有时我们的悲伤或困难怎样使我们对神明显的应许视而不见？

3. Mary knew Jesus very well. Why couldn’t she recognize Jesus at first?

    马利亚非常熟悉耶稣。为什么她一开始没能认出耶稣？

4. Jesus sent Mary’s fears away with a single word. What message was Mary to give to the disciples?

    耶稣只用一个词就消除了马利亚的担心。马利亚给门徒们的信息是什么？

5. Jesus told Mary “I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” What are some important truths we can take from these words of Jesus?

    耶稣告诉马利亚“我要升上去见我的父，也是你们的父，见我的神，也是你们的神。”我们从耶稣的这些话里获得什么重要的真理？

### II. Jesus appears to his disciples (John 20:19-31) 耶稣向门徒显现（ 约翰20:19-31）

#### A. Jesus appears to his disciples on Easter evening (19-23) 耶稣在复活的晚上向门徒显现  (19-23)

1. On Easter evening the disciples were gathered behind locked doors. By this time they heard the testimony from the women and the two disciples at Emmaus who saw Jesus alive. Luke 24:34 also tells us Jesus appeared to Peter sometime during the day. This should have been the happiest day of the disciples’ lives. Why were they hiding instead?

    耶稣复活的那个晚上，门徒们聚集在一起，门上了锁。到那时，他们已听见妇女们和以马忤斯看见复活的耶稣的两个门徒的见证。路加福音24:34 也告诉我们耶稣在那一天的某个时间向彼得显现了。这本应该是门徒一生中最幸福的一天。他们为什么反而躲起来？

2. The words “Peace be with you” were a standard greeting among Jewish people at that time. As we consider Jesus’ resurrection what greater meaning could the disciples take from this greeting?

    “愿你们平安”是那个时代犹太人平常的问安语。从耶稣复活的方面来考虑，门徒们从这个问安中能体会到什么更深的含义？

3. What does this greeting from Jesus mean for us?

    耶稣的这个问安对我们有什么意义？

4. What proof did Jesus give His disciples to assure them that He had risen?

    耶稣给门徒们什么证明使他们确信他已经复活？

5. What important work did Jesus now give his disciples to do?

    耶稣给了门徒们什么重要的工作去做？

6. Suppose you tell a repentant friend that their sins are forgiven. They are still filled with doubts. They ask you “How can you be so sure? Isn’t God the only one who can forgive sins? How would you answer them?

    假设你告诉一个悔改的朋友他的罪已得赦免。他们仍然充满了疑惑。他们问你“你怎么这样确信呢”不是只有神才能赦罪吗？你怎么回答他们？

7. Our Lord Jesus gave to his followers the authority to announce forgiveness of sins in his name. When are we to withhold this announcement of forgiveness?

    我们的主耶稣给他的跟随者奉他的名宣告赦免罪的权柄。什么时候我们可以保留赦免罪的宣告？


#### B. Jesus appears to Thomas (24-31) 耶稣向多马显现(24-31)

1. Thomas was not with the disciples when Jesus appeared to them on Easter evening. Why wouldn’t Thomas believe Jesus had risen from the dead?

    当耶稣在复活的那个晚上向门徒们显现时多马不在场。多马为什么不相信耶稣已经从死里复活？

2. How did Jesus deal with Thomas?

    耶稣怎样对待多马？

3. What does this teach us about the way our Lord Jesus chooses to deal with us when we have doubts in our faith?

    在此教导我们当我们在信仰上产生怀疑时，主耶稣选择对待我们的方式是怎样的？

4. How would you answer the person who says: “I must have visible, tangible proof of the truth of Christianity before I will believe it?”

    有人说“在我相信之前，我必须有可见的，有形的证据证明基督教的真实”你怎样回答？

5. In verse 30 what important insights does John give us into Jesus miracles?

    30节，约翰对主的神迹赋予我们什么重要的见解？

6. According to verse 31 what is the great purpose of the Gospel of John?

    根据31节，约翰福音这卷书的 伟大目的是什么？
