**Introduction**

**介绍**

Since Christianity began, the outward form of the church has undergone several changes. As Jesus once said to the Samaritan woman at the well, “God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth” (John 4:24).

基督教从一开始起，就在教会的外在形式上经历了多次变革，正如耶稣曾经对撒玛利亚妇人在井边说过的话：“神是个灵，所以拜他的必须用心灵和诚实（在真理和圣灵中）来敬拜他”（约4:24）

Christianity was an outlawed faith in most locations until Emperor Constantine legalized the faith across the Roman Empire in A.D. 313.

基督教在大多数地方都是不被法律保护的信仰，直到公元313年康斯坦丁大帝在整个罗马帝国将它合法化。

The significant division, often called “The Great Schism” occurred in A.D. 1054 as a result of the Western church declaring the Bishop of Rome as their pope (father) or Vicar of Christ. This was based on a false view of Matthew 16 where they believe Peter was the first pope and that there has always been an apostolic succession of popes since that time.

【教派的重大分裂发生在公元1054年，常被称为“教派大分裂”（“The Great Schism” ）。分裂的原因是西方教会宣布罗马的主教为他们的教皇（神父），或天主教教宗。他们的根据是对马太福音16章的错误理解，他们相信彼得是第一位教皇，而且认为从那时起就一直有教皇在延续。

The Eastern Church disagreed which led to the great split in the church. The Easter Church’s capital is located in Constantinople and is comprised of churches from Greece, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Western Asia. The chart below will help you follow a rough outline of the various Christian denominations over the past 2,000 years.

东方教会不同意，于是导致了教会的大分裂。东方教会的都城位于君士坦丁堡，包含的教会有希腊、俄国、东欧和西亚。下面的表格就是过去两千多年来基督教不同教派的略图。

**Orthodoxy – a study in Basic Christian Doctrine**

**正统派教会— 基督徒基本教义的学习**

Orthodoxy (from Greek orthos ("right", "true", "straight") + doxa ("opinion" or "belief", related to dokein, "to think"),) is adherence to accepted norms, more specifically to creeds, especially in religion. In the Christian sense the term means "conforming to the Christian faith as represented in the creeds (Apostle’s Creed, Nicene Creed, & Athanasian Creed) of the early Church". 

![](/images/note/jdjysjzj/2-2.jpg#right)

正统派教会（来自希腊语orthos—意为正确、 真实、正直的+ doxa（“意见”或“信念”， 与Dokein有关，指“思想”），）遵守公认的 准则，更具体地说，就是遵守信条，尤其是宗教 方面的信条。对基督徒来讲，这个词的意思是 “遵守早期教会的信经中提出的基督徒信条 （包括使徒信经、尼西亚信经和亚他那修信经。）”

Our Lord’s desire for ALL Christians, no matter what their origin of faith stems from, is that they are orthodox or true to his Word and holding firmly to his promises of salvation. Read the following…

不管基督徒的信仰起源如何，我们的主期望所有基督徒的信仰都是正统的，或者是忠于他话语的，而且能坚定地持守他对救恩的应许。读以下经文：

John 8:31-32 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

约8:31-32----31 耶稣对那些相信他的犹太人说：““你们如果住在我的话语中，就真是我的门徒了，32  并且你们将明白真理，而真理将使你们自由。”

1. Why does Jesus want us to both “know” the truth and “hold” to the truth?

    耶稣为什么要我们不仅“明白”真理，还要“持守”真理？

    1 Corinthians 1:10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.

    林前1:10 弟兄们，我借我们主耶稣基督的名，劝你们都说一样的话。你们中间也不可分党。只要一心一意彼此相合。

2. Why is it so critical that God’s people work at orthodoxy?

    对神的儿女来说，为什么持守正统教义是如此关键？

    Philippians 1:27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel.

    腓立比书1: 27 只要你们行事为人与基督的福音相称。叫我或来见你们，或不在你们那里，可以听见你们的景况，知道你们同有一个心志，站立得稳，为所信的福音齐心努力。

3. How do we “contend as one man for the faith of the gospel”?

    我们怎样“为所信的福音齐心努力”？

    **Heterodoxy**

    **异端**

    Heterodox refers to a church that has turned away from accepted Scriptural teachings. A heterodox church uses the Word of God and teaches that Jesus is true God and the only Savior of mankind. However, because they no longer hold “unswervingly” to the Word of God, their faith is in constant pressure from the false teachings. Therefore, members of a heterodox church fail to enjoy the full freedom, which God intended for us to have. Read the following…

    异端指的是一个从公认的圣经教导中偏离的教会。异端的教会也使用神的话语，教导耶稣是真神，是人类唯一的救主。但是，他们不再坚定不移地坚持神的话，他们的信心也不断地处在假教导的压迫之下。因此，异端教会的成员没能够享受到神想要我们享受的完整自由。读以下经文：

    Hebrews 10:23-25 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another – and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

    来10:23-25----23 也要坚守我们所承认的指望，不至摇动。因为那应许我们的是信实的。 24 又要彼此相顾，激发爱心，勉励行善。 25 你们不可停止聚会，好像那些停止惯了的人，倒要彼此劝勉。既知道（原文作看见）那日子临近，就更当如此。

    • The severity of false teaching in the Christian church today can vary greatly from one church to the next, which is why it is of utmost importance that use our Bibles to discern false teachers and false teachings and then adhere to the Bible’s instruction of “Keeping away from them.” Read the following…

    • 今天基督教会中假教导的严重程度因教会而异。教会必须要用圣经来分辨假教师和假教导，并坚持圣经的教训“远离他们”，这是极其重要的。读以下经文：

    Matthew 7:15,16 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them.” 
    
    ![](/images/note/jdjysjzj/2-3.jpg#right)
    
    太7:15-16----15 你们要防备假先知。他们到你们这里来，外面披着羊皮，里面却是残暴的狼。 16 凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢？

4. Does Jesus warn orthodox, or Bible believing Christians of heterodox churches?
    
    耶稣是否警告过正统派教会，即相信圣经的 基督徒，要谨防异端的教会？

    1 John 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.

    约一4:1 亲爱的弟兄阿，一切的灵，你们不可都信。总要试验那些灵是出于神的不是。因为世上有许多假先知已经出来了。

5. Does the apostle John tell us that we can trust every pastor or teacher of the Word of God?

    使徒约翰告诉我们，我们可以信任宣讲神话语的每一个牧师或教师吗？

    Romans 16:17,18 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.

    罗16:17-18----17 弟兄们，那些离间你们，叫你们跌倒，背乎所学之道的人，我劝你们要留意躲避他们。 18 因为这样的人不服事我们的主基督，只服事自己的肚腹。用花言巧语，诱惑那些老实人的心。

6. What instruction does the apostle Paul give orthodox Christians when they come in to contact with heterodox Christians? Why?

    当正统派基督徒和异端基督徒接触之后，使徒保罗给正统派教会什么教导？为什么？

    2 Timothy 4:1-3 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.  For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.

    提后4:1-3----1 我在神面前，并在将来审判活人死人的基督耶稣面前，凭着他的显现和他的国度嘱咐你。 2 务要传道。无论得时不得时，总要专心，并用百般的忍耐，各样的教训，责备人，警戒人，劝勉人。 3 因为时候要到，人必厌烦纯正的道理。耳朵发痒，就随从自己的情欲，增添好些师傅。

7. Paul, writing to another pastor by the name of Timothy, tells us why people go away from orthodoxy or accepted Bible teachings. He says it is because they want their “ears itched” instead. What do you suppose Paul means by that expression?

    保罗在给另外一名叫提摩太的牧师写信，同时也在告诉我们，人们为什么会从正统派，或公认的圣经教导中偏离。他说那是因为他们的“耳朵发痒”。你认为保罗的这种表达是什么意思？

**Practical Application Orthodox/Heterodox**

**正统派/异端的实践及应用**

Of all the various Christian churches out there, and there are thousands of different denominations that vary from each other, there are mainly 3 differing branches of Christianity with a whole lot of sub-points as the chart on p. 1 indicates. But perhaps we can summarize them with these 3 titles: Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Reform.

在那里的所有不同基督教会中，有成千上万个不同的教派。基督教主要有3大不同分支，每个分支都有一大堆的次要点，就像第一页的表格所显示的内容。但也许我们可以用以下3个名称来归纳：罗马天主教，路德会和改革宗/归正教会。

Now imagine the following debate between a Catholic Priest, a Lutheran Pastor, and a Reform teacher. This is what the 3 men will bring with them to the debate:

现在假设一个天主教牧师，路德会牧师和一个改革宗教师之间正在进行一场辩论。这3个人要拿来辩论的内容如下：

Catholic: The Bible + 1,900 years of writings from the church fathers that they say are on the same level as the Holy Scripture. 
    
![](/images/note/jdjysjzj/2-4.jpg#right)
    
    
    
天主教：圣经+1900年来 教父著作中的内容 与圣经同等重要。

Lutheran: The Bible

路德会：圣经

Reform: The Bible + their brain as they believe and teach that everything in Scripture has to agree with their reason and intellect.

改革宗/归正派：圣经+他们的头脑。因为他们相信而且教导，圣经中的一切话语都必须要符合他们的理性和智慧。

Martin Luther, the man after whom our church body is named after, once made the statement: “It is not Scripture that needs to be made reasonable; it’s reason that needs to be made Christian.” As for the church fathers, Luther also pointed out many errors and contradictions that church fathers had regarding articles of faith in the Bible. Therefore, one of the founding principles that came out of the Lutheran Reformation was the Latin term, Sola Scriptura, which means, “By the Scriptures Alone,” do we derive our articles of faith from, whether they make sense to our intellect or not. For it is not the duty of Christians to try and make sense out of every matter of doctrine, but rather that we simply reveal what the Scriptures state.

马丁路德，就是我们用他的名字来称呼教会的那一位，曾经这样说过：“不是我们要把圣经变得更理智，而是我们的理智需要更像基督徒。” 路德指出，教会的先父对圣经的信条也有很多错误和矛盾之处。因此，路德的改革制定了一个基要原则：不管它能不能通过我们的理性，“唯独圣经”是我们信条的来源（拉丁语把它称为Sola Scriptura）。因为基督徒的责任不是要努力让教义的每一条内容能通过我们的理性，而是要来揭示圣经所陈述的内容。 
    
    
That’s why it makes it much easier for me to categorically label all of Christendom into 3 main camps and the pictures would like this:

**Practical Application**

**实际应用**

Let’s take a look at a handful of Biblical teachings and see how some Christian churches have swerved to the right or the left of what the Bible clearly teaches.

我们来看一些圣经的教导，也看看一些基督教会是怎样从圣经清楚教导的内容上偏离左右的。

**• Baptism**

**• 浸信会**

Matthew 28:18-20 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

![](/images/note/jdjysjzj/2-18.jpg#right)

太28:18-20----18 耶稣进前来，对他们说，天上，地下所有的权柄，都赐给我了。 19 所以你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名，给他们施洗。（或作给他们施洗归于父子圣灵的名） 20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。 替代文本

Acts 2:38-39 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.

徒2:38-39----38 彼得说，你们各人要悔改，奉耶稣基督的名受洗，叫你们的罪得赦，就必领受所赐的圣灵。 39 因为这应许是给你们，和你们的儿女，并一切在远方的人，就是主我们神所召来的。

**Consider this Baptist statement of faith from 1688**

**思考浸信会自1688年以来的信仰声明**

“Infant baptism is rejected, because only an adult can consciously perform an act of Obedience; in order to be baptized one must actually profess repentance towards God, faith in and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ. Since children cannot do this, they therefore are not to be admitted to baptism.”

“婴儿洗礼不被接受，因为只有成人能有意识地表现顺服的行为；如果想接受洗礼，一个人必须实际地向神公开表示悔改、相信耶稣并顺服我们的主耶稣基督。既然孩童做不到这一点，就不能允许他们接受洗礼。”

• Those under the sub-point of “Reform” deny baptism to infants and their argument that they so often use is that the Bible doesn’t say infants should be baptized. But the real reason behind the denial of infant baptism is that it doesn’t make sense to their reason that God can work forgiveness and salvation in the heart of a little child, or that God would even need to work these things in a child’s heart. And since their intellect is on the same plateau as the clear writings of Scripture, they teach an age of accountability, something that’s never taught in Scripture, that a young child has a free pass from God till he’s somewhere between the age of 10-13, the time that he can make an intelligible decision for his salvation.

“改革宗”的次要点里也不接纳婴儿洗礼，他们常使用的论点是，圣经没有说应该给婴儿施洗。但婴儿施洗背后的真正原因是，神能在孩童心里做饶恕和救赎的工作，或者说，神甚至需要在一个孩子的心里做这些工作。这种观点通不过他们的理性，而且因为他们的理性和圣经清楚的教导被放在了同一个高度，他们附加了一种叫“负责任的年龄”这一说法，一种圣经中从来没有教导过的东西。他们认为小孩子有一张从神来的自由通行证，认为他们只有到了10-13岁之间，才能为自己的得救做出理智的决定。

• Interestingly enough, orthodoxy, or the defense for Infant baptism from the Scriptures is first and foremost the words of our Savior, who commands “All nations” to be baptized, which is certainly inclusive of infants. But to use the reform argument that says the Bible doesn’t command the baptism of infants can be used against them. Read the following passages of Scriptures and see if you can determine in the following passages if infants and small children were to be excluded:

• 有趣的是，维护正统派，或者根据圣经为婴儿施洗的，首先是我们救主说的话：他要“万民”受洗，这当然也包括婴儿。但改革宗说，圣经没有要求给婴儿施洗，这就违背了主的话。读以下圣经经文，看看你是否能确定婴儿和小孩子一定是排除在外的。

Acts 16:14,15 The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message. When she and the members of her household were baptized…

徒16:14,15----14 有一个卖紫色布疋的妇人，名叫吕底亚，是推雅推喇城的人，素来敬拜神。她听见了，主就开导她的心，叫她留心听保罗所讲的话。 15 她和她一家，既领了洗，便求我们说，你们若以为我是真信主的，（或作你们若以为我是忠心事主的）请到我家里来住。于是强留我们。

Acts 16:33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.

徒16:33 当夜就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤。他和属乎他的人，立时都受了洗。

1 Corinthians 1:16 Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas.

林前1:16  我也给司提反家施过洗。此外给别人施洗没有，我却记不清。

The likelihood of each of these 3 households, who were all baptized, not having infants or children in them younger than 10 years old seems highly improbable. However, the clear words of Jesus remain, “Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” Since children and babies are born sinful, and in need of forgiveness and new life, and are part of “all nations” orthodoxy mandates that we suppress our intellect and often times sinful reasoning for the clear words of Scripture.

被施洗的三家人中的每一家都没有婴孩或小于10岁孩子的可能性似乎微乎其微。然而，耶稣的话仍然很清楚，“去使万民做我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名为他们施洗。”既然孩童和婴儿都是生来有罪的，需要饶恕和新生命，而且是“万国”中的一份子，正统派命令，我们必须禁止自己的理性，而且常常是那些对圣经清晰话语作罪性推理的理性。

**• The Lord’s Supper**

**• 圣餐**

Now let’s read the Scriptures to determine orthodoxy…

我们现在来读圣经，确定其中的正统说法——

Matthew 26:26-30 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."  27Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you. 28This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. 29I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."  30When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

太26：26-30----26 他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就掰开，递给门徒，说，你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。 27 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说，你们都喝这个。 28 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。 29 但我告诉你们，从今以后，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里，同你们喝新的那日子。 30 他们唱了诗，就出来往橄榄山去。

1 Corinthians 11:27-29 “Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.”

林前11:27-29----27 所以无论何人，不按理吃主的饼，喝主的杯，就是干犯主的身主的血了。 28 人应当自己省察，然后吃这饼，喝这杯。 29 因为人吃喝，若不分辨是主的身体，就是吃喝自己的罪了。

The apostle Paul makes it very clear that the communicant receives 4 things in Holy Communion…

1. Bread

2. Cup (wine)

3. Body

4. Blood

使徒保罗说得很清楚，领受圣餐的人在圣餐礼中接受4样东西：

1. 饼

2. 杯（酒）

3. 身体

4. 血

Jesus couldn’t be clearer when he states that the spiritual blessing in the meal he instituted is the forgiveness of sins. So why, then, do some believe only the body and blood are present? Why do others believe that only bread and wine are present? Based on the Bible, we would definitely NOT say that the Bible leaves it as an open-ended question. The reason is that the Roman Catholic Church rely on the tradition of what their forefathers taught them, even if it doesn’t coincide with the Scriptures. And the Reform camp believes that everything in the Scriptures have to be reasonable and since it is not reasonable that we receive the body and blood of Jesus, just like it’s not reasonable to them that God can work faith in an infant…, therefore they conclude that it must not be what we read in the Scriptures.

耶稣说得再清楚不过了，他说，他设立的这顿饭中的属灵祝福是罪得赦免。为什么会有人相信其中只有身体和血呢？为什么也还有人相信其中只有饼和酒呢？从圣经看，我们绝不能说圣经给我们留了一个开放性的问题，可以任意作答。罗马天主教徒依靠的是祖先教导的传统，哪怕这传统跟圣经并不吻合。改革宗相信圣经中的一切都必须合乎理性。既然领受耶稣的身体和血是不合理性的，正如神能在婴儿心里制造信心不合理性一样----，所以他们得出结论说，这些肯定不是我们在圣经中读到的内容。

Orthodoxy does NOT form itself from one particular denomination of Christianity. Orthodoxy is formed by the Word itself. For God’s Word stands as its own testimony for every Christian to either believe, doubt, or reject. But it is the Scriptures that serve as our only source of doctrine and articles of faith.

正统派的形成并没有依据基督教的某一个派别，正统派依据的是圣经本身。因为神的话在向每一位基督徒作见证，我们要么相信，要么怀疑，要么拒绝。但唯有圣经是我们教义和信条的唯一来源。
