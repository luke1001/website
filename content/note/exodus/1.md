Exodus 1:1-22
出埃及记1:1-22
            The long period of peace and tremendous growth which Israel had enjoyed under friendly Egyptian rulers (over 300 years) now came to an end. The old dynasty that reached back to Joseph's day and had passed on from one king to another the grateful remembrance of Joseph as the one who had preserved the nation from famine was no longer in power. A new king ascended the throne who was hostile to the Israelites.
以色列人在友好的埃及统治者治下的和平及繁荣增长时期（超过300年）现在已经结束了。在约瑟时代的旧王朝，那个曾经感激约瑟使这个国家免于饥荒的王不再掌权。一个敌视以色列人的新王登上了宝座。
            The new king saw the people of Israel only as a threat to his country and his rule. Pharaoh feared that in the event of war the Israelites would join forces with the enemy and then use the opportunity to leave the country. Therefore the king proposed a policy to keep the Israelites numbers in check by grinding them down with hard labor.
这个新王仅将以色列人视之为对国家和其统治的威胁。法老担心一旦战争爆发，以色列人可能会与敌人结盟并借机离开这个国家。因此这个王就拿出一项政策即通过苦役折磨以色列人以使他们的人数得到控制。
            Putting this policy into effect, the authorities set taskmasters over the Israelites. The more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more they multiplied and grew, so that their oppressors became even more alarmed over the potential danger posed by this vigorous people.
为了推行这项政策，掌权者设立了监工来管理以色列人。埃及人越是压迫以色列人，以色列人越是繁盛增长，这使得压迫者们更多的感到在这群强健的人中所潜伏的威胁。
            The Pharaoh then gave the order for the Hebrew midwives to kill all the sons, but allow the daughters to live. The midwives disobeyed Pharaoh's orders and allowed the boys to live. In desperation, Pharaoh gave the order that every son born to the Hebrews was to be thrown into the Nile to drown; only the daughters were to be allowed to live.
于是法老下令给希伯来收生婆，要她们杀死所有的男婴，仅使女婴存活。收生婆违背法老的命令反而使男婴存活。无可奈何的法老王命令把所有希伯来人家的男婴都扔进尼罗河中淹死，仅留下女婴存活。
            The first chapter, verses 1-7  summarizes Genesis 37-50, which describe in full how Jacob's family arrived in Egypt.
第一章1-7节总结了创世纪37-50章，说明雅各全家是怎样到达埃及地的。
kecheng: The Israelites Oppressed
    1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; 3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; 4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. 5 The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. How many descendants moved to Egypt over 300 years ago?
   6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 7 but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.  What do we learn about the Israelites while they lived in Egypt?
   8 Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” How can you tell that Pharaoh was concerned about the number of Israelites?
   11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. What did the Israelites build? 12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 13 and worked them ruthlessly. How did the Egyptians treat the Israelites? 14 They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. What kind of work did the Israelites have to perform?
   15 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, 16 “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”What did the king/Pharaoh order? 17 The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. What do we learn about the midwives? 18 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” Why is this a surprising question?
   19 The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” How did the midwives explain why they could not stop the children from being born?
   20 So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. 21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. What blessing did God give to the midwives?
   22 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.” To whom did the Pharaoh give the order to kill all the Hebrew boys?
以色列人在埃及受虐待
1以色列的众子，各带家眷，和雅各一同来到埃及。他们的名字记在下面。2有吕便、西缅、利未、犹大、3以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、4但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设。5凡从雅各而生的，共有七十人。雅各家300年前有多少人抵达埃及？
约瑟已经在埃及。6约瑟和他的弟兄，并那一代的人，都死了。7以色列人生养众多，并且繁茂，极其强盛，满了那地。对于以色列人在埃及地的生活我们有哪些了解？
8有不认识约瑟的新王起来，治理埃及，9对他的百姓说：「看哪，这以色列民比我们还多，又比我们强盛。10来吧，我们不如用巧计待他们，恐怕他们多起来，日后若遇什么争战的事，就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们，离开这地去了。」你怎么看得出来法老担心以色列人的数目？
11于是埃及人派督工的辖制他们，加重担苦害他们。他们为法老建造两座积货城，就是比东和兰塞。以色列人建造了什么？12只是越发苦害他们，他们越发多起来，越发蔓延；埃及人就因以色列人愁烦。13埃及人严严地使以色列人做工，埃及人怎样对待以色列人的？14使他们因做苦工觉得命苦；无论是和泥，是做砖，是做田间各样的工，在一切的工上都严严地待他们。以色列人需要进行怎样的工作？
15有希伯来的两个收生婆，一名施弗拉，一名普阿；埃及王对她们说：16「你们为希伯来妇人收生，看她们临盆的时候，若是男孩，就把他杀了；若是女孩，就留她存活。」法老王的命令是什么？17但是收生婆敬畏　神，不照埃及王的吩咐行，竟存留男孩的性命。我们对这两位收生婆有哪些了解？18埃及王召了收生婆来，说：「你们为什么做这事，存留男孩的性命呢？」为什么这是一个意外的问题？
19收生婆对法老说：「因为希伯来妇人与埃及妇人不同；希伯来妇人本是健壮的，收生婆还没有到，她们已经生产了。」收生婆是怎么解释她们无法杀害这些刚出生的孩子的？
20神厚待收生婆。以色列人多起来，极其强盛。21收生婆因为敬畏　神，　神便叫她们成立家室。神赐给收生婆什么样的祝福？
22法老吩咐他的众民说：「以色列人所生的男孩，你们都要丢在河里；一切的女孩，你们要存留她的性命。」法老给哪些人下命令要杀害所有希伯来的男婴？
