kecheng: Exodus 7:1-25 出埃及记7:1-25
Exodus 7:1-25
出埃及记7:1-25
The chapter begins with the Lord patiently repeating  His promises to Moses. The first of the ten plagues is recorded in this chapter. These plagues (miracles) serve as penalties for Pharaoh's refusal to let the Israelites go. While these plagues were not altogether unknown to the Egyptians, the fact that they came when Moses commanded and in close succession proved to Pharaoh that the Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth.
本章由耶和华耐心的向摩西重述祂的应许开始。在本章中首次提及十灾。这些灾难（神迹）是因为法老拒绝以色列人离开而使其受到的惩罚。所有的埃及人也并不是对这些灾难一无所知，实际上，灾难随着摩西的命令相继而来，向法老证明了耶和华是天地的主。
kecheng: 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 2 You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country. How can Moses be like God? 3 But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt, 4 he will not listen to you. Why should Moses keep asking Pharaoh to let the Israelites go when God tells Moses, the Pharaoh will not listen? Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites. What are the divisions? 5And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it.” What will the Egyptians learn?
   6 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them. 7 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. How old was Moses when he fled to Midian? (See Acts 7:20-29)How long did Moses live in Midian?
1耶和华对摩西说：「我使你在法老面前代替　神，你的哥哥亚伦是替你说话的。2凡我所吩咐你的，你都要说。你的哥哥亚伦要对法老说，容以色列人出他的地。摩西怎么可能代替神？3我要使法老的心刚硬，也要在埃及地多行神迹奇事。4但法老必不听你们；虽然神告诉摩西法老不会听从他，摩西为什么还要坚持向法老要求让以色列人离开？我要伸手重重地刑罚埃及，将我的军队以色列民从埃及地领出来。军队是指什么？5我伸手攻击埃及，将以色列人从他们中间领出来的时候，埃及人就要知道我是耶和华。」埃及人将学到什么？
6摩西、亚伦这样行；耶和华怎样吩咐他们，他们就照样行了。7摩西、亚伦与法老说话的时候，摩西八十岁，亚伦八十三岁。摩西逃往米甸时是多少岁？（参考使徒行传7:20-29）摩西在米甸生活了多久？
kecheng: Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Snake
    8 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 9 “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.” What was the first miracle Aaron was to perform?
   10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. 11 Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: 12 Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. What did the wise men and sorcerers do?  But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. What did this prove? 13 Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
What does " Pharaoh’s heart became hard" mean?
亚伦的杖变蛇
8耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说：9「法老若对你们说：『你们行件奇事吧！』你就吩咐亚伦说：『把杖丢在法老面前，使杖变作蛇。』」亚伦行的第一件神迹是什么？
10摩西、亚伦进去见法老，就照耶和华所吩咐的行。亚伦把杖丢在法老和臣仆面前，杖就变作蛇。11于是法老召了博士和术士来；他们是埃及行法术的，也用邪术照样而行。12他们各人丢下自己的杖，杖就变作蛇；博士和术士做了什么事？但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖。这证明了什么？13法老心里刚硬，不肯听从摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。“法老心里刚硬”意味着什么？

kecheng: The Plague of Blood
    14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Why would Pharaoh go the river? Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 16 Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. 17 This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the LORD: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood. 18 The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’” Describe the first plague. What do you know about the Nile River? What did the Lord want Pharaoh to know?
血灾
14耶和华对摩西说：「法老心里固执，不肯容百姓去。15明日早晨，他出来往水边去，法老为什么要往水边去？你要往河边迎接他，手里要拿着那变过蛇的杖，16对他说：『耶和华—希伯来人的　神打发我来见你，说：容我的百姓去，好在旷野事奉我。到如今你还是不听。17耶和华这样说：我要用我手里的杖击打河中的水，水就变作血；因此，你必知道我是耶和华。18河里的鱼必死，河也要腥臭，埃及人就要厌恶吃这河里的水。』」请描述第一灾。你对尼罗河有哪些了解？耶和华要让法老明白什么？
kecheng:    19 The LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone.” What did finding blood in vessels of wood and stone prove?
   20 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood. 21 The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt. Where was the blood?
   22 But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. What could the Egyptians do? 23 Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart. What do we learn about Pharaoh? 24 And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river. Where did the Egyptians find water?
    25 Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
19耶和华晓谕摩西说：「你对亚伦说：『把你的杖伸在埃及所有的水以上，就是在他们的江、河、池、塘以上，叫水都变作血。在埃及遍地，无论在木器中，石器中，都必有血。』」在木器和石器中都有血证明了什么？
20摩西、亚伦就照耶和华所吩咐的行。亚伦在法老和臣仆眼前举杖击打河里的水，河里的水都变作血了。21河里的鱼死了，河也腥臭了，埃及人就不能吃这河里的水；埃及遍地都有了血。血在哪里？
22埃及行法术的，也用邪术照样而行。法老心里刚硬，不肯听摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。埃及人能够做什么？23法老转身进宫，也不把这事放在心上。我们对法老有哪些了解？24埃及人都在河的两边挖地，要得水喝，因为他们不能喝这河里的水。埃及人在哪里找水？
 25耶和华击打河以后满了七天。
