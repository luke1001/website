Exodus 14:1-31
出埃及记14:1-31
            God miraculously brings Israel through the waters, but this is more than simply passing a geographic barrier. When Israel crosses through the sea, they leave behind slavery and a future of death in Egypt for freedom and a future life with God. Israel is powerless to make this drastic change on its own, but God intervenes to provide the way.
            神奇妙的带领了以色列人从水中经过，然而这不仅仅是穿过了地理上的藩篱。当以色利人过红海以后，他们脱离了在埃及地为奴、等死的境地，奔向自由和将与神同在的生活。以色列人自己不可能做出这样巨大的改变，是神的介入给他们开了出路。
kecheng: Crossing the Red Sea
 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, 2 “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon. What route did God direct Israel to take out of Egypt? 3 Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’ 4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites did this. What were God's reasons for choosing this longer route?
   5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!” Why did Pharaoh and his officials change their mind? What had Pharaoh forgotten? 6 So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him. 7 He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them. 8 The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly. 9 The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemenand troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon. What must have Pharaoh's army thought as they came upon the Israelits.?
过红海
1耶和华晓谕摩西说：2「你吩咐以色列人转回，安营在比·哈希录前，密夺和海的中间，对着巴力·洗分，靠近海边安营。神引领以色列人出埃及时走了哪一条路线？3法老必说：『以色列人在地中绕迷了，旷野把他们困住了。』4我要使法老的心刚硬，他要追赶他们，我便在法老和他全军身上得荣耀；埃及人就知道我是耶和华。」于是以色列人这样行了。神为什么要选择这样一条较长的路线？
5有人告诉埃及王说：「百姓逃跑。」法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心，说：「我们容以色列人去，不再服事我们，这做的是什么事呢？」法老和他的臣仆为什么变心？法老忘记了什么？6法老就预备他的车辆，带领军兵同去，7并带着六百辆特选的车和埃及所有的车，每辆都有车兵长。8耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬，他就追赶以色列人，因为以色列人是昂然无惧地出埃及。9埃及人追赶他们，法老一切的马匹、车辆、马兵，与军兵就在海边上，靠近比·哈希录，对着巴力·洗分，在他们安营的地方追上了。当法老和他的军兵追上以色列人时，他们一定在想什么？
   10 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 11 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? What had the Israelites already forgotten? 12 Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!” What belief do the Israelites express?
   13 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. Why do the Israelites need not fear? 14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.” What does Moses remind the Israelites?
   15 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 16 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.  What is God's plan? What do you remember about the staff? 17 I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” What did God want the Egyptians to realize?
   19 Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel’s army, withdrew and went behind them. Who is traveling with the Israelites? The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, 20 coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long. Describe the special protection God provided for this people.
10法老临近的时候，以色列人举目看见埃及人赶来，就甚惧怕，向耶和华哀求。11他们对摩西说：「难道在埃及没有坟地，你把我们带来死在旷野吗？你为什么这样待我们，将我们从埃及领出来呢？以色列人已经忘记了什么？12我们在埃及岂没有对你说过，不要搅扰我们，容我们服事埃及人吗？因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好。」以色列人表现出了怎样的信念？
13摩西对百姓说：「不要惧怕，只管站住！看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩。因为，你们今天所看见的埃及人必永远不再看见了。为什么以色列人不需要惧怕？14耶和华必为你们争战；你们只管静默，不要作声。」摩西提醒了以色利人什么事？
15耶和华对摩西说：「你为什么向我哀求呢？你吩咐以色列人往前走。16你举手向海伸杖，把水分开。以色列人要下海中走干地。神的计划是什么？你还记得关于这杖的哪些事情？17我要使埃及人的心刚硬，他们就跟着下去。我要在法老和他的全军、车辆、马兵上得荣耀。18我在法老和他的车辆、马兵上得荣耀的时候，埃及人就知道我是耶和华了。」神要让埃及人明白什么？
19在以色列营前行走　神的使者，转到他们后边去；谁在与以色列人同行？云柱也从他们前边转到他们后边立住。20在埃及营和以色列营中间有云柱，一边黑暗，一边发光，终夜两下不得相近。请你描述神对祂的子民所赐予的特别保护？
   21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided, 22 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. Describe Israel's crossing of the Red Sea.
   23 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea. 24 During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion. Who is responsible for the confusion? 25 He jammedthe wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.”What do the Egyptians realize?
   26 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”How does Moses protect the Israelites?  27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing towardit, and the LORD swept them into the sea. What do the Egyptians attempt? 28 The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived. How does God deal with the Egyptians?
   29 But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. 30 That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore. What two the Israelites realize? 31 And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant. What was the outcome of the crossing of the Red Sea for Israel?
21摩西向海伸杖，耶和华便用大东风，使海水一夜退去，水便分开，海就成了干地。22以色列人下海中走干地，水在他们的左右作了墙垣。请你描述以色列人过红海的场景。
23埃及人追赶他们，法老一切的马匹、车辆，和马兵都跟着下到海中。24到了晨更的时候，耶和华从云火柱中向埃及的军兵观看，使埃及的军兵混乱了；谁造成的混乱？25又使他们的车轮脱落，难以行走，以致埃及人说：「我们从以色列人面前逃跑吧！因耶和华为他们攻击我们了。」埃及人意识到了什么？
26耶和华对摩西说：「你向海伸杖，叫水仍合在埃及人并他们的车辆、马兵身上。」摩西是如何保护以色列人的？27摩西就向海伸杖，到了天一亮，海水仍旧复原。埃及人避水逃跑的时候，耶和华把他们推翻在海中，埃及人想要做什么？28水就回流，淹没了车辆和马兵。那些跟着以色列人下海法老的全军，连一个也没有剩下。神是如何对待埃及人的？
29以色列人却在海中走干地；水在他们的左右作了墙垣。30当日，耶和华这样拯救以色列人脱离埃及人的手，以色列人看见埃及人的死尸都在海边了。以色列人明白了哪两件事？31以色列人看见耶和华向埃及人所行的大事，就敬畏耶和华，又信服他和他的仆人摩西。对以色列来说，过红海的结果是什么？
