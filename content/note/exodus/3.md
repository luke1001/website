Exodus 3:1-25
出埃及记3:1-25
            In chapter 2:16 we learn Moses met the priest of Midian who had seven daughter. In verses 18-19, we learn the father of the seven daughters is called Reuel. As the chapter opens, we find that Reuel is also called Jethro.
在2:16节我们知道摩西遇见了米甸的祭司和他的七个女儿。在18-19节，我们知道了这七个女儿的父亲的名字叫做流珥。在本章一开始我们发现，流珥还被称为叶忒罗。
kecheng: Moses and the Burning Bush
    1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. What is Moses job and where did God appear to him? 2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Who is the "angel of the Lord"? Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. 3 So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.” In what miraculous way did God get Moses' attention? What has God used to get your attention?
   4 When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!”
   And Moses said, “Here I am.” How did Moses answer God?
   5 “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” Why was Moses not to come any closer? 6 Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” What else does God tell Moses? Why? At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. Why was Moses afraid to look at God?
   7 The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. What has God seen? 8 So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. Who use to live in the land of the Canaanites? How does God describe the home of the Canaanites? 9 And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10 So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.” How does God intend to use Moses?
   11 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” What did Moses' initial response to God's call of service indicate?
            In your opinion, why did God call Moses to serve as Israel's human leader and deliverer at this time when Moses was eager to do this 40 years earlier?
            Agree or Disagree? God frequently calls His people to service when they are not expecting to be called. Explain your answer.
   12 And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.” What encouragement did God give to Moses?
   13 Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” What is Moses second objection ?Why is Moses question about God's name important?
摩西和燃烧的荆棘
1摩西牧养他岳父米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群；一日领羊群往野外去，到了　神的山，就是何烈山。摩西的工作是什么？神在哪里向他显现？2耶和华的使者从荆棘里火焰中向摩西显现。“耶和华的使者”是谁？摩西观看，不料，荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁。3摩西说：「我要过去看这大异象，这荆棘为何没有烧坏呢？」神以怎样奇妙的方式来引起摩西的注意的？神用怎样的方式来吸引你的注意的？
4耶和华　神见他过去要看，就从荆棘里呼叫说：「摩西！摩西！」
他说：「我在这里。」摩西是怎样回应神的？
5神说：「不要近前来。当把你脚上的鞋脱下来，因为你所站之地是圣地」；摩西为什么不能靠前？6又说：「我是你父亲的　神，是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神。」神还告诉摩西什么？为什么？摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看　神。摩西为什么怕见神？
7耶和华说：「我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了；他们因受督工的辖制所发的哀声，我也听见了。我原知道他们的痛苦，神看见了什么？8我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，领他们出了那地，到美好、宽阔、流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人之地。谁曾经住在迦南地？神是怎么描述迦南地的？9现在以色列人的哀声达到我耳中，我也看见埃及人怎样欺压他们。10故此，我要打发你去见法老，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。」神想要怎样使用摩西？
11摩西对　神说：「我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？」摩西起初是怎样回应对他呼召的启示的？按照你的观点，为什么神为什么要在现在呼召摩西作为以色列人的领袖并带领他们而不是在40年前摩西更愿意去做这件事的时候？你是否同意，神常常在祂的子民没有预期的时候呼召他们来服事。请解释你的回答？12神说：「我必与你同在。你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山上事奉我；这就是我打发你去的证据。」神给予摩西怎样的鼓励？
13摩西对　神说：「我到以色列人那里，对他们说：『你们祖宗的　神打发我到你们这里来。』他们若问我说：『他叫什么名字？』我要对他们说什么呢？」摩西第二个拒绝的理由是什么？为什么摩西关于神名字的问题如此重要？

kecheng: God Reveals His Name
   14 God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” What does the name mean?
   15 God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’
   “This is my name forever,
   the name you shall call me
   from generation to generation. What else does God tell us about Himself?
神启示自己的名字
14神对摩西说：「我是自有永有的」；这个名字是什么意思？
又说：「你要对以色列人这样说：『那自有的打发我到你们这里来。』」15神又对摩西说：「你要对以色列人这样说：『耶和华—你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，打发我到你们这里来。』耶和华是我的名，直到永远；这也是我的纪念，直到万代。神还告诉我们哪些关乎祂自己的是？
kecheng: The Lord's Instruction to Moses
   16 “Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. What is God's relation to Moses? 17 And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ What instructions does God give to Moses?
   18 “The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.’ What are they to tell the King of Egypt? 19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. How will the King react to the message?  20 So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go. What is God's response to the king?
   21 “And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. 22 Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.” Why did God want the Israelites to receive treasures from the Egyptians as they departed from Egypt?
神对摩西的指示
16你去招聚以色列的长老，对他们说：『耶和华—你们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，向我显现，说：我实在眷顾了你们，我也看见埃及人怎样待你们。神和摩西的关系是怎样的？17我也说：要将你们从埃及的困苦中领出来，往迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地去，就是到流奶与蜜之地。』神给摩西怎样的指示？
18他们必听你的话。你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王，对他说：『耶和华—希伯来人的　神遇见了我们，现在求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，为要祭祀耶和华—我们的　神。』他们要对埃及王怎样说？19我知道虽用大能的手，埃及王也不容你们去。那王将怎样回应这个信息？20我必伸手在埃及中间施行我一切的奇事，攻击那地，然后他才容你们去。神会怎样回应那王？
21我必叫你们在埃及人眼前蒙恩，你们去的时候就不至于空手而去。22但各妇女必向她的邻舍，并居住在她家里的女人，要金器银器和衣裳，好给你们的儿女穿戴。这样你们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。」神为什么想要以色列人在离开埃及地的时候接受埃及人的财物？
kecheng: Notes注释
Elders - The Hebrew for this word mean "bearded ones," perhaps reflecting the age, wisdom, experience and influence necessary for a man expected to lead.
长老 - 该希伯来词意为“有胡须的人”，可能是指对于一个领袖而言所需要有的年龄、智慧、经验和影响力。
