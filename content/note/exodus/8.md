Exodus 8:1-32
出埃及记8:1-32
       This chapter sets a recurring theme of sin, oppression (the plagues), repentance, and deliverance. Magicians and sorcerers cannot stop the power of God.
       本章有一个反复循环的主题：犯罪、压制（十灾）、悔改和拯救。博士和术士不能抵挡神的能力。
kecheng: The Plague of Frogs
   1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. What demand did Moses once again make? 2 If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. 3 The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. 4 The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’” Describe the second plague.
   5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’” How far would the frogs be found?
   6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 7 But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt. Once again, what could the magicians do? What could the magicians not do?
   8 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.” How did Pharaoh initially respond to this plague?
   9 Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.” What "honor" did God show Pharaoh?
   10 “Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.
   Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God. 11 The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” What did Moses want Pharaoh to know?
   12 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. 13 And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields. How did God answer Moses prayer? 14 They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. What reasons can you suggest to explain why Pharaoh went back on his promise to let Israel worship the Lord?
蛙灾
1耶和华吩咐摩西说：「你进去见法老，对他说：『耶和华这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。摩西再次提出了什么要求？2你若不肯容他们去，我必使青蛙糟蹋你的四境。3 河里要滋生青蛙；这青蛙要上来进你的宫殿和你的卧房，上你的床榻，进你臣仆的房屋，上你百姓的身上，进你的炉灶和你的抟面盆，4又要上你和你百姓并你众臣仆的身上。』」请描述第二灾？
5耶和华晓谕摩西说：「你对亚伦说：『把你的杖伸在江、河、池以上，使青蛙到埃及地上来。』」青蛙会出现在多大的范围里？
6亚伦便伸杖在埃及的诸水以上，青蛙就上来，遮满了埃及地。7行法术的也用他们的邪术照样而行，叫青蛙上了埃及地。我们再次看到，行法术的都能做什么？他们不能够做什么？
8法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：「请你们求耶和华使这青蛙离开我和我的民，我就容百姓去祭祀耶和华。」法老起初是如何回应这一灾的？
9摩西对法老说：「任凭你吧，我要何时为你和你的臣仆并你的百姓祈求，除灭青蛙离开你和你的宫殿只留在河里呢？」   神“任凭”法老做什么事？
10他说：「明天。」摩西说：「可以照你的话吧，好叫你知道没有像耶和华—我们　神的。11青蛙要离开你和你的宫殿，并你的臣仆与你的百姓，只留在河里。」摩西想让法老明白什么？
12于是摩西、亚伦离开法老出去。摩西为扰害法老的青蛙呼求耶和华。13耶和华就照摩西的话行。凡在房里、院中、田间的青蛙都死了。神是怎样回应摩西的祷告的？14众人把青蛙聚拢成堆，遍地就都腥臭。15但法老见灾祸松缓，就硬着心，不肯听他们，正如耶和华所说的。你认为有哪些原因导致法老硬着心不肯让以色列人去敬拜神？

请使用法老为例，定义“临阵磨枪式基督徒”的含义。
kecheng: Notes注释
Frogs - The frog or toad was worshipped as the goddess Heqt, who helped women in childbirth. The Egyptian religion forbade them to kill the frogs because they were objects of worship.
青蛙–青蛙或蛤蟆被作为掌管生育的女神Heqt来敬拜，埃及的宗教禁止人们杀死青蛙，因为它们是敬拜的对象。
kecheng: Land of Egypt - The first three plagues covered the whole land and fell upon both Israelites and Egyptians.
埃及地–前三灾都覆盖了整个地土包括以色列人和埃及人。
kecheng: The Plague of Gnats
    16 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.” 17 They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. Describe the third plague. 18 But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. What were the magicians unable to do?
   Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, 19 the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” What do the magicians acknowledge? But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said. What was Pharaoh's attitude?
虱灾
16耶和华吩咐摩西说：「你对亚伦说：『伸出你的杖击打地上的尘土，使尘土在埃及遍地变作虱子。』」17他们就这样行。亚伦伸杖击打地上的尘土，就在人身上和牲畜身上有了虱子；埃及遍地的尘土都变成虱子了。请描述这一灾。18行法术的也用邪术要生出虱子来，却是不能。行法术的无法做什么？于是在人身上和牲畜身上都有了虱子。19行法术的就对法老说：「这是　神的手段。」行法术的认识到什么？法老心里刚硬，不肯听摩西、亚伦，正如耶和华所说的。法老的态度是怎样的？
kecheng: Notes注释
Gnats - The gnats inflict stings and cause painful skin irritation; they creep into the eyes and nose.
虱子–虱子会叮咬人并且会刺激皮肤；它们还能爬进眼睛和鼻子里。
kecheng: The Plague of Flies
    20 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the LORD says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. What message was Moses to deliver? 21 If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them. Describe the fourth plague
   22 “‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land. 23 I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’” How was this plague different than the previous plagues?
   24 And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.  Look at verses 20-24. Identify at least three ways God was making it increasingly clearer to Pharaoh that He was the Lord?
   25 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.” What was Pharaoh's response?
   26 But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us? 27 We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us.” What explanation does Moses give Pharaoh?
   28 Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” What condition does Pharaoh impose? For what does Pharaoh want Moses to pray?
   29 Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.” What warning does Moses give Pharaoh?
   30 Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, 31 and the LORD did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained. 32 But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go. What do you think of Pharaoh's response?
蝇灾
20耶和华对摩西说：「你清早起来，法老来到水边，你站在他面前，对他说：『耶和华这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。摩西传达了什么信息？21你若不容我的百姓去，我要叫成群的苍蝇到你和你臣仆并你百姓的身上，进你的房屋，并且埃及人的房屋和他们所住的地都要满了成群的苍蝇。请描述第四灾。
22当那日，我必分别我百姓所住的歌珊地，使那里没有成群的苍蝇，好叫你知道我是天下的耶和华。23我要将我的百姓和你的百姓分别出来。明天必有这神迹。』」这一灾和之前的有什么不同？
24耶和华就这样行。苍蝇成了大群，进入法老的宫殿，和他臣仆的房屋；埃及遍地就因这成群的苍蝇败坏了。查考20-24节，找出至少三处神清楚的向法老显示自己是至高神的方式。
25法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：「你们去，在这地祭祀你们的　神吧！」法老是如何回应的？
26摩西说：「这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华—我们的　神；若把埃及人所厌恶的在他们眼前献为祭，他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗？27我们要往旷野去，走三天的路程，照着耶和华—我们　神所要吩咐我们的祭祀他。」摩西是如何向法老解释的？
28法老说：「我容你们去，在旷野祭祀耶和华—你们的　神；只是不要走得很远。求你们为我祈祷。」法老强行加上了什么条件？法老想要摩西祈求什么？
29摩西说：「我要出去求耶和华，使成群的苍蝇明天离开法老和法老的臣仆并法老的百姓；法老却不可再行诡诈，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华。」摩西给了法老什么警告？
30于是摩西离开法老去求耶和华。31耶和华就照摩西的话行，叫成群的苍蝇离开法老和他的臣仆并他的百姓，一个也没有留下。32这一次法老又硬着心，不容百姓去。你对法老的回应怎么看？
kecheng: Notes注释
Flies - More aggressive than gnats. Full grown, the flies infest houses and stables and bite men and animals.
苍蝇–比虱子更有攻击性。成熟的苍蝇，成群的出现在屋子里和畜舍中，叮咬人和牲畜。
