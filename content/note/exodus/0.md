Introduction to the book of Exodus 出埃及记简介
Introduction to the book of Exodus
出埃及记简介
kecheng: The Book of Exodus (a Greek word meaning "exit" or "departure") is the second of the five books known collectively as the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) written by Moses. Exodus could be considered the central book in the Old Testament because it records God's act of saving the Israelites and establishing them as a covenant community, a nation chosen to serve and represent Him.
圣经出埃及记（英文名Exodus源于希腊文，意为“离开”或“启程”）是被称为摩西五经（创世纪、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记）中的第二卷书。出埃及记可以说是旧约圣经中的核心书卷，因为其中记载了神对以色列民的救赎并且把他们建立成为一个约中的团体，一个被拣选来侍奉和代表神的国民。
kecheng: To help us understand Exodus, we must go back and review Genesis
要明白出埃及记，我们必须回顾创世纪中的内容
kecheng: ·      Genesis chapters 1-2 details the creation of the world. In chapter 3 we learn how sin entered the world through Adam and Eve's disobedience and that the promise of a Savior will come. Cain kills his brother Abel in chapter 4 and chapter 5 lists the genealogy of Adam to Noah.
            创世纪1-2章详述了创造世界的细节。在第三章中我们知道了罪是如何由亚当和夏            娃的背叛而进入世界的，以及救赎主将要来的预言。第四章中该隐杀害了他的兄           弟亚伯。第五章列出了从亚当到挪亚的家谱。
·      In Genesis chapters 6-9 Goddirects Noah to build an ark in order to escape the coming judgment, we know as the Flood. Chapters 10-11 tell us how God repopulates the world with Noah and his three sons.
            在创世纪6-9章神指引挪亚建立一个方舟来脱离将要来的审判——就是我们所知的  大洪水。10-11章告诉我们神怎样再次由挪亚和他的三个儿子中再次使世人繁衍生                    息。
·      In chapters 12-21, Abram is called to leave his home in Ur And move to a new land where he will live and have descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky. When Abraham is 100 and his wife Sarah is 90, Isaac is born.
      在创世纪12-21章，亚伯兰被呼召离开他在吾珥的家乡到他所不知道的地方去，他              将在哪里生活并且他的后裔将像天上的星一样多。亚伯拉罕一百岁、他的妻子撒拉  90岁的时候，他们的儿子以撒出生了。
·      In Genesis chapters 22-27 we see Isaac grow and soon he marries Rebekah. They are blessed with twin sons, Esau and Jacob.
      在创世纪22-27章我们看到以撒成长起来并且娶了利百加为妻。他们得赐双胞胎儿              子，以扫和雅各。
·      We learn about Jacob in chapters 28-35. When Jacob deceives his brother, he eventually flees for his life to live with his uncle Laban. Jacob marries Laban's two daughters Leah and Rachel. Eventually Jacob has 12 sons and has become a very wealthy man. Jacob goes back home, to make peace with his brother Esau. On the return trip, Jacob wrestles with God  and his name is changed to Israel. Israel (Jacob) is now living in Canaan and his descendants are called Israelites. One of his sons is named Joseph
      我们在创世纪28-35章中知道关于雅各的事。当雅各欺骗了他的兄长以扫后，最终  逃命到他的舅舅拉班那里生活。雅各娶了拉班的两个女儿利亚和拉结。最终雅各有  了12个儿子并成为一个非常富有的人。雅各回到家乡，要与他的兄弟以扫和好。    在回去的路上，雅各与神摔跤并被改名叫以色列。于是以色列（雅各）生活在迦南  地，他的后裔被成为以色列人。他有一个儿子叫约瑟。
·       Genesis chapters 36-50 tells the story of Joseph. Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers and was a slave in Egypt. God delivers Joseph and he eventually becomes the right hand man to Pharaoh. Joseph and his brothers make peace. The brothers move their families to Egypt where they are treated with respect and honor. The Genesis narrative ends with the death of Joseph.
创世纪36-50章告诉我们约瑟的故事。约瑟被他的兄长们卖给奴隶贩子在埃及做奴隶。神救出约瑟，最终他成为法老的宰相。约瑟和他的兄弟们和好。他的兄弟们也搬家到埃及地并受到尊敬。创世纪的叙述以约瑟的死结束。
kecheng: Exodus
出埃及记
The book of Exodus starts more than 300 years after Genesis ends. During these silent years, God blessed the Israelites and they grew in numbers and wealth. But the long period of peace and tremendous growth which Israel had enjoyed under friendly Egyptian rule had come to an end. As their numbers grew, so did the Egyptian's fear that they would pose a threat; therefore Jacob's descendants (Israelites) were enslaved.
圣经出埃及记记载的时期为自创世纪结束时期之后的300余年  。在没有被记述的这三百年中，神祝福以色列人，他们的人数和财富就都大大增长。但以色列人所有的长久和平和巨大增长以及埃及人的温和统治将结束了。随着以色列人数的增长，埃及人更加担心他们将成为一个威胁；因此雅各的子孙（以色列人）成为奴隶。
Thus at the beginning of Exodus we read about the pharaoh ordering the death of all newborn boys among the slaves. One woman saves her son and sets him afloat in a basket on the Nile River, where he's found by the pharaoh's daughter. He's named Moses and must later flee Egypt after killing an overseer beating a slave.
因此在出埃及记的一开始我们读到法老命令所有奴隶新生的儿子都要处死。有一个女人得了一个儿子并把他藏在一个篮子里放在尼罗河中，最终这个孩子被法老的女儿拣到。他被起名叫摩西，后来因为他杀了一个殴打奴隶的监工而不得不逃离埃及。
kecheng: Important Characters in Exodus
出埃及记中的重要章节
kecheng: Moses: God's special prophet. He leads the Hebrews out of Egypt and towards Canaan (present day Israel).
摩西：神的特殊先知。他带领希伯来人出埃及向迦南地（现今的以色列）进发。
kecheng: Aaron: Moses' older brother. He becomes the first high priest of Israel.
亚伦：摩西的哥哥。他成为以色列的第一个大祭司。
kecheng: Miriam: Moses' sister
米利暗：摩西的姐姐
kecheng: Pharaoh: Unnamed ruler of Egypt, responsible for keeping the Hebrews enslaved
法老：不知名的埃及统治者，使希伯来人为奴的始作俑者。
kecheng: Chosen People: Central to the entire idea of God taking the Israelites out of Egypt is that the Israelites were to be God's "Chosen People".
选民：神带领以色列人出埃及的中心意思是以色列人是神的“选民”。
            To be "chosen" entailed benefits and obligations: they benefited from God's blessings and favor, but they were also obliged to uphold special laws created by God for them. Failure to uphold God's laws would lead to a withdrawal of protection.  
被“拣选”意味着恩典和契约：他们蒙受神的祝福和喜爱，同时他们要满足神为他们特设的律法约定。如果不能持守神的律法将使他们失去庇护。
            Singling out the Israelites as the Chosen People stems from God's earlier covenant with Abraham. Being the Chosen People meant that there was a covenant between the Israelites as a whole and God — a covenant that would also bind all their descendants, whether they liked it or not.
单就以色列人做为选民来讲，是出于神之前与亚伯拉罕所立的约。作为选民意味着全体以色列人和神之间有一个约——这个约也包括他们所有的子孙，无论他们愿不愿意。
kecheng: The Presence of God: God makes more personal appearances in the Book of Exodus than in most other parts of the Bible. Sometimes God is physically and personally present, as when talking to Moses on Mt. Sinai. Sometimes the presence of God is felt through natural events (thunder, rain, earthquakes) or miracles (a burning bush where the bush is not consumed by fire).
神的面：神在出埃及记中显现的次数比在圣经中其他任何地方都多。有时神明明的显明在出来，就如在西奈山上与摩西交谈。有时神的临在藉着自然界的事件（雷电、雨、地震）或者神迹（荆棘被火烧着，却没有烧毁）。
kecheng: Exodus conveys four strong messages
出埃及记传达四个有力的信息
kecheng: 1.     The Lord God: God revealed Himself to Moses and Israel as Yahweh, "I Am Who I Am." This covenant name for God carries profound meaning and affirms the power, authority, and eternal nature of God.
耶和华：神向摩西和以色列人启示祂自己为耶和华，“我是自有永有的”。这个          约中的名字带有深刻的含义，并显明神的能力、权柄和永恒。
kecheng: 2.     Redemption: The Israelites prayed for deliverance and God responded. God worked through His servant-leader Moses, but He did it in such a miraculous way that it was obvious that God was at work. The Israelites could not save themselves; it was all the work of God. The Passover was established to serve as an annual reminder of God's work on their behalf.
救赎：以色列人呼求拯救并且得到神的回应。神藉着祂的仆人领袖摩西工作，但   透过祂奇妙的的工作我们清楚明白的知道这是神的工作。以色列人无法救赎自    己；这全是神的工作。设立逾约节就是为了每年纪念神为他们所做的工。
kecheng: 3.     Law: The law of God is encapsulated in the Ten Commandments, God's absolutes for spiritual and moral living. The law is divided into two sections: the civil law-the rules that govern life in the community-and the ceremonial law-the patterns for worship and building the tabernacle.
律法：神的律法包含在十诫中，十诫是神对灵性和道德生活的绝对准则。律法被              分为两部分：民事法-管理民众生活的法律；礼仪律-敬拜和建立会幕的样式。
kecheng: 4.     Tabernacle: God gave specific instructions on how the tabernacle was to be built, but its significance is in what it represented-God dwelling among His people. He was specifically understood to dwell in the holy of holies, inaccessible to the normal Israelite. The tabernacle points ahead to the moment when Christ removed the veil of separation (Matt 27:51), giving all believers access to God.
会幕：神对会幕如何建造赐下特定的指导，但其意义在于会幕所预表的——神居  住在祂的子民中间。祂特别指明将居住在至圣所中，这是普通以色列人不能见到    的地方。会幕预先指向基督去除隔离的幔子（马太福音27:51）的时刻，使所有的   信徒得以来到神面前。
