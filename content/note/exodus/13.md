Exodus 13:1-22
出埃及记13:1-22
            The firstborn of Israel belongs to the Lord. It means that we must yield our lives to Jesus, consecrating ourselves as to Him. The Lord set Israel apart by instituting observances that help them remember their freedom won in the exodus.
            以色列头生的都归耶和华。这意味着我们必须把我们的生活都交给耶稣，把我们自己奉献给祂。耶和华藉着设立礼仪规定来把以色列人分别出来，从而帮助他们记得他们在出埃及记中赢得的自由。
kecheng: Consecration of the Firstborn
    1 The LORD said to Moses, 2 “Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.” What command did God give Israel regarding their firstborn males?
   3 Then Moses said to the people, “Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast. 4 Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving. 5 When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month: Who was living in the Promised Land? How did God describe the land? 6 For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD. 7 Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders. 8 On that day tell your son, ‘I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9 This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand. 10 You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year. What does God once again tell the Israelites they must remember? Why does the Lord repeat Himself?
奉献头胎的
1耶和华晓谕摩西说：2「以色列中凡头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都是我的，要分别为圣归我。」耶和华给以色列人什么样的关乎头生男性的命令？3摩西对百姓说：「你们要记念从埃及为奴之家出来的这日，因为耶和华用大能的手将你们从这地方领出来。有酵的饼都不可吃。4亚笔月间的这日是你们出来的日子。5将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地，就是他向你的祖宗起誓应许给你那流奶与蜜之地，那时你要在这月间守这礼。哪些人生活在应许之地？耶和华是如何描述那地的？6你要吃无酵饼七日，到第七日要向耶和华守节。7这七日之久，要吃无酵饼；在你四境之内不可见有酵的饼，也不可见发酵的物。8当那日，你要告诉你的儿子说：『这是因耶和华在我出埃及的时候为我所行的事。9这要在你手上作记号，在你额上作纪念，使耶和华的律法常在你口中，因为耶和华曾用大能的手将你从埃及领出来。10所以你每年要按着日期守这例。』」耶和华再次告诉以色列人他们需要紧记什么事？耶和华为什么要这样重复自己的话？
   11 “After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors, Who were the ancestors? 12 you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD. 13 Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. The donkey was not acceptable as a sacrifice. The people were to redeem a firstborn male donkey by sacrificing a lamb or by breaking the donkey's neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons. The Israelites were to consecrate their children to life rather than to death, so this command prohibited human sacrifice. Jesus Christ was the lamb offered by God on our behalf.
   14 “In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’ What does the Lord want the Israelites and the future generations to learn? Whom did God send as the perfect once for all sacrifice?
16 And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand.”
11「将来，耶和华照他向你和你祖宗所起的誓将你领进迦南人之地，把这地赐给你，祖宗指的是谁？12那时你要将一切头生的，并牲畜中头生的，归给耶和华；公的都要属耶和华。13凡头生的驴，你要用羊羔代赎；若不代赎，就要打折它的颈项。驴不可作为祭物。人们要用羊羔来代赎头生的驴，不然就要打折驴的颈项。凡你儿子中头生的都要赎出来。以色列人把他们的子民献给生命而不是死亡，所以这条诫命禁止用人来献祭耶稣基督是神为我们献上的羔羊。14日后，你的儿子问你说：『这是什么意思？』你就说：『耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及为奴之家领出来。15那时法老几乎不容我们去，耶和华就把埃及地所有头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都杀了。因此，我把一切头生的公牲畜献给耶和华为祭，但将头生的儿子都赎出来。耶和华想要以色列人和他们的后代学到什么？神差遣谁来一次为所有人献上?
16这要在你手上作记号，在你额上作经文，因为耶和华用大能的手将我们从埃及领出来。』」
kecheng: Notes注释
Firstborn male - The firstborn represented all Israel, whom God chose as His own firstborn among the nations. As individuals, the firstborn were living reminders of this calling in every home. Scripture describes firstborn sons as receiving a double portion of the inheritance, a special blessing, and headship of the family.
头生的 – 头生的代表所有以色列人，就是神拣选做万民中的头生的子民。就个人来说，头生的是每一家中活着的提醒，提醒人们这样的呼召。圣经中头生的儿子要承受双倍的产业，特别的祝福及家中领袖的地位。
kecheng: Crossing the Sea
    17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” Why did they not take the shorter route? 18 So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle. How equipped do you think the Israelites were? Why?
   19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.” Who was Joseph? What beliefs were expressed by taking Joseph's body on the journey? Comment on the importance of dying wishes and honoring them.
   20 After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. 21 By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. How did God guide the people? 22 Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people. When was God present? Why would the cloud by day and the pillar of fire never leave its place?
过红海
17法老容百姓去的时候，非利士地的道路虽近，　神却不领他们从那里走；因为　神说：「恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔，就回埃及去。」他们为什么不走近路？18所以　神领百姓绕道而行，走红海旷野的路。以色列人出埃及地，都带着兵器上去。你认为以色利人的装备如何？为什么？
19摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去；因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严地起誓，对他们说：「　神必眷顾你们，你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去。」约瑟是谁？把约瑟的骸骨带在路上表达了怎样的信念？请分享你对重视临终者的遗言这种行为的评论。
20他们从疏割起行，在旷野边的以倘安营。21日间，耶和华在云柱中领他们的路；夜间，在火柱中光照他们，使他们日夜都可以行走。神是如何引领人的？22日间云柱，夜间火柱，总不离开百姓的面前。神在什么时候与他们同在？为什么日间云柱、夜间火柱总不离开？
kecheng: Notes注释
Philistine country - A direct trade route to Canaan ran along the coast and passed a series of fortified Egyptian outposts and Philistine settlements. Egyptians controlled this route and would obstruct Israel's journey. Also the Lord had earlier planned for Israel to worship at Mt. Sinai. See 3:1,12.
非利士地 – 通往迦南地的一条笔直的贸易路线依傍着海岸线并通过一系列埃及人的要塞和非利士人的居住地。埃及人控制着这条路线并且会阻挠以色列人的行程。同时，耶和华曾计划以色列人要在西奈山上敬拜祂。参考3:1,12。
kecheng: Pillar of cloud - The pillar of a cloud was a miraculous cloud, resembling a pillar. In the daytime it was a dark and heavy cloud, which moved in front of the marching Israelites, showing them where to go and protected them from the hot rays of the desert sun.
云柱 – 云柱是一种神迹，像柱子一样的云朵。在白天的时候，是黑色、沉重的云，在以色列人行进的路上前行，向他们指明前进的方向并保护他们免受旷野中日光的伤害。
