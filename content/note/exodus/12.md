Exodus 12:1-51
出埃及记12:1-51
            The institution of Passover took place at the Lord's command. The Lord established Israel as a nation by the Passover. At the end of the chapter, the Lord will give additional regulations concerning the Passover due to the fact that Egyptians and likely other persons have joined themselves to the Israelites.
逾越节是因着耶和华的命令设立的。耶和华藉着逾越节建立了以色列民族。在本章的最后，耶和华将再次吩咐关乎逾越节的条例，因为埃及人以及其他人也参参杂在以色列人中间。
kecheng: The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread
    1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, 2 “This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. 3 Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lambfor his family, one for each household. 4 If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. How will they decide if they are to share the lamb? 5 The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. What does it mean "without defect"? 6 Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. When were the lambs to be slaughtered? When is it twilight? 7 Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. What were they to do with the blood? 8 That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. What additional directions are given? For what do the bitter herbs stand? Why is the bread made without yeast? 9 Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs. Why with the head, legs, and internal organs? 10 Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. 11 This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD’s Passover. What does it mean to eat with your cloak tucked into your belt? sandals on your feet? staff in your hand? Why were they to eat in haste?
   12 “On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD. Who was the Lord going to bring judgment on? 13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. How would the Israelites be protected?
逾越节和无酵节
1耶和华在埃及地晓谕摩西、亚伦说：2「你们要以本月为正月，为一年之首。3你们吩咐以色列全会众说：本月初十日，各人要按着父家取羊羔，一家一只。4若是一家的人太少，吃不了一只羊羔，本人就要和他隔壁的邻舍共取一只。你们预备羊羔，要按着人数和饭量计算。他们要如何分享羊羔？5要无残疾、一岁的公羊羔，你们或从绵羊里取，或从山羊里取，都可以。“无残疾”是什么意思？6要留到本月十四日，在黄昏的时候，以色列全会众把羊羔宰了。在哪一天宰羊羔？黄昏是什么时候？7各家要取点血，涂在吃羊羔的房屋左右的门框上和门楣上。他们要拿血做什么？8当夜要吃羊羔的肉；用火烤了，与无酵饼和苦菜同吃。还有什么指示？苦菜表明什么？为什么要做无酵饼？9不可吃生的，断不可吃水煮的，要带着头、腿、五脏，用火烤了吃。为什么要带着头、腿、五脏?10不可剩下一点留到早晨；若留到早晨，要用火烧了。11你们吃羊羔当腰间束带，脚上穿鞋，手中拿杖，赶紧地吃；这是耶和华的逾越节。吃羊羔当腰间束带是什么意思？脚上穿鞋是什么意思？手中拿仗是什么意思？为什么要赶紧地吃？
12因为那夜我要巡行埃及地，把埃及地一切头生的，无论是人是牲畜，都击杀了，又要败坏埃及一切的神。我是耶和华。耶和华要将审判行使在什么人身上？13这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号；我一见这血，就越过你们去。我击杀埃及地头生的时候，灾殃必不临到你们身上灭你们。」以色列人将如何被保护起来？
kecheng:    14 “This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD—a lasting ordinance. For how long were they to remember this day?  15 For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. 16 On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do. What further instructions did God give the Israelites concerning the Feast of Unleavened Bread?
   17 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. What are divisions? Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. 18 In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 19 For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. What does it mean to be cut off from Israel? 20 Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.” What instructions does God repeat? Why?
14「你们要记念这日，守为耶和华的节，作为你们世世代代永远的定例。他们要记念这日子多长时间？15你们要吃无酵饼七日。头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去；因为从头一日起，到第七日为止，凡吃有酵之饼的，必从以色列中剪除。16头一日你们当有圣会，第七日也当有圣会。这两日之内，除了预备各人所要吃的以外，无论何工都不可做。对于无酵节，耶和华对以色列人还有那些指示？
17你们要守无酵节，因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来。军队是指什么？所以，你们要守这日，作为世世代代永远的定例。18从正月十四日晚上，直到二十一日晚上，你们要吃无酵饼。19在你们各家中，七日之内不可有酵；因为凡吃有酵之物的，无论是寄居的，是本地的，必从以色列的会中剪除。从以色列的会中剪除是什么意思？20有酵的物，你们都不可吃；在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼。」耶和华重复了什么指示？为什么？
kecheng:    21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 22 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. For how long were the Israelites to remain in their homes? 23 When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. Why will the Lord pass over the doorway and not go in? Who is the destroyer?
   24 “Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. 25 When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. 26 And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ 27 then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’” Then the people bowed down and worshiped. 28 The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron. What was the purpose of making Passover an annual festival for the Israelites to celebrate? What are some festivals that we celebrate to remember the Lord?
   29 At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well. What happened at midnight? 30 Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. Which families were affected?
21于是，摩西召了以色列的众长老来，对他们说：「你们要按着家口取出羊羔，把这逾越节的羊羔宰了。22拿一把牛膝草，蘸盆里的血，打在门楣上和左右的门框上。你们谁也不可出自己的房门，直到早晨。以色列人要在家里待多久？23因为耶和华要巡行击杀埃及人，他看见血在门楣上和左右的门框上，就必越过那门，不容灭命的进你们的房屋，击杀你们。耶和华为什么会越过门不进房屋？灭命的是谁？
24这例，你们要守着，作为你们和你们子孙永远的定例。25日后，你们到了耶和华按着所应许赐给你们的那地，就要守这礼。26你们的儿女问你们说：『行这礼是什么意思？』27你们就说：『这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。当以色列人在埃及的时候，他击杀埃及人，越过以色列人的房屋，救了我们各家。』」于是百姓低头下拜。28耶和华怎样吩咐摩西、亚伦，以色列人就怎样行。将逾越节定为以色列人永远的定例的目的是什么？我们会定期庆祝哪些节日来记念神？
 29到了半夜，耶和华把埃及地所有的长子，就是从坐宝座的法老，直到被掳囚在监里之人的长子，以及一切头生的牲畜，尽都杀了。半夜时发生了什么事？30法老和一切臣仆，并埃及众人，夜间都起来了。在埃及有大哀号，无一家不死一个人的。哪些家庭受到了影响?
kecheng: Notes注释
Passover - The feast commemorating the fact that God passed over the houses of the Israelites when all the first born of the Egyptians were slain.
逾越节 – 记念耶和华越过了以色列人的房屋并击杀了所有埃及人的头生的节期。
kecheng: First month of your year - Nisan (Abib) Starting the year with Passover reminded Israel that all its live as the people of God was grounded in God's act in the exodus. This corresponds to our latter part of March and April
本月为正月 – 尼散月（亚笔月）及逾越节作为一年的起始，提醒以色列人他们能成为神的子民是因着神在出埃及记中的作为。这也符合我们之后对于三月和四月的学习。
kecheng: Each household - Only members of one family or family circle should gather together, not a group of unrelated people.
一家 – 只有一家或一个家族内的成员聚在一起而不是一群没有关系的人在一起。
kecheng: A lasting ordinance - The following description may be given: The feast began by the handing around of a cup of wine mixed with water over which the head of the family  pronounced the benediction. The lamb, roasted whole, and the other dishes were then placed on the table, and after a second cup of wine the meal was eaten. Everybody present partook of the lamb, the bitter herbs, and the unleavened bread and care was taken that no bone was broken. After the heal followed the third cup of wine, then the singing of psalms and hymns, and finally a fourth, and perhaps a fifth cup of wine.
永远的定例 – 下面的描述可供参考： 节期开始于传递一杯掺水的酒开始，这酒由家长来祝祷。然后在桌上摆上烤羊羔肉和其它食物，在第二杯酒之后开始吃食物。每个人都分享一部分羊羔，苦菜和无酵饼，并且留心不折断一根骨头。在第三杯酒之后，唱诗篇和赞美诗，最后为第四杯酒，也可能还会有第五杯酒。
kecheng: Bread made without yeast - The bread had no yeast and the loaves were shaped like a plate. The unleavened bread was very thin and was broken, not cut.
无酵饼 – 没有酵的面饼是扁平的。无酵饼很薄并且是掰碎的而不是切开的。
kecheng: Destroyer - Refers to an angel that administers God's judgment. See 2 Samuel 24:15-16, 2 Kings 10:35, and 1 Corinthians 10:10.
灭命的 – 指的是行使神审判的天使。参考撒母耳记下24:15-16, 列王纪下10:35, 和哥林多前书 10:10.
kecheng: The Exodus
    31 During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. 32 Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. Why did Pharaoh summon Moses and Aaron? And also bless me.” For what is Pharaoh really asking?
   33 The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!” Of what were the Egyptians afraid? 34 So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. 35 The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. How else did the Egyptians respond? 36 The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians. Was this plundering fair?
   37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. It is estimated that there were more than two million Israelite men, women, and children.The procession was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) in length. 38 Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. Who might some of these other people be? 39 With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves. What types of food would the people eat in the wilderness? Do you think this was a slow or quick departure? Why?
   40 Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egyptwas 430 years. 41 At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD’s divisions left Egypt. 42 Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come. Who kept watch all night?
出埃及
31夜间，法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说：「起来！连你们带以色列人，从我民中出去，依你们所说的，去事奉耶和华吧！32也依你们所说的，连羊群牛群带着走吧！法老为什么要召摩西和亚伦？并要为我祝福。」法老实际上在请求什么？
33埃及人催促百姓，打发他们快快出离那地，因为埃及人说：「我们都要死了。」埃及人惧怕的是什么？34百姓就拿着没有酵的生面，把抟面盆包在衣服中，扛在肩头上。35以色列人照着摩西的话行，向埃及人要金器、银器，和衣裳。埃及人是怎样对待他们的？36耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩，以致埃及人给他们所要的。他们就把埃及人的财物夺去了。 这样的抢夺公平吗？
37以色列人从兰塞起行，往疏割去；除了妇人孩子，步行的男人约有六十万。估计有超过两百万的以色列男人、女人和儿童。队伍大概有19公里（12英里）长。38又有许多闲杂人，并有羊群牛群，和他们一同上去。这些闲杂人可能是哪些人？39他们用埃及带出来的生面烤成无酵饼。这生面原没有发起；因为他们被催逼离开埃及，不能耽延，也没有为自己预备什么食物。这些人在旷野里吃的是什么样的食物？你认为这是缓慢的起行还是快速的起行?为什么？
40以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年。41正满了四百三十年的那一天，耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。42这夜是耶和华的夜；因耶和华领他们出了埃及地，所以当向耶和华谨守，是以色列众人世世代代该谨守的。夜晚的时候是谁在看守？
kecheng: Passover Restrictions
    43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal:
   “No foreigner may eat it. Who would be considered a foreigner? 44 Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him, 45 but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it. Why not a temporary resident or a hired worker?
   46 “It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. 47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
   48 “A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate the LORD’s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it. Who may not eat the Passover meal? 49 The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.”
   50 All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. What do we learn about the Israelites obedience to the Lord? 51 And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions. Think back on the first 12 chapters of Exodus. Who was helped by Moses' faithfulness and who was hurt by Pharaoh's hard-heartedness?
逾越节的条例
43耶和华对摩西、亚伦说：「逾越节的例是这样：
外邦人都不可吃这羊羔。哪些人是外邦人？44但各人用银子买的奴仆，既受了割礼就可以吃。45寄居的和雇工人都不可吃。为什么寄居的和雇工人都不可吃？
46应当在一个房子里吃；不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去。羊羔的骨头一根也不可折断。47以色列全会众都要守这礼。48若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的男子务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，他也就像本地人一样；但未受割礼的，都不可吃这羊羔。哪些人不能吃逾越节的食物？49本地人和寄居在你们中间的外人同归一例。」
50耶和华怎样吩咐摩西、亚伦，以色列众人就怎样行了。我们从以色列人对神的顺服中学到了什么？51正当那日，耶和华将以色列人按着他们的军队，从埃及地领出来。请回想出埃及记的前十二章。哪些人因摩西的忠信而受益？哪些人因为法老的刚硬而受伤害？
