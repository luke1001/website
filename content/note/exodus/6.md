Exodus 6:1-30
出埃及记6:1-30
            The Lord will strengthen Moses' faith by giving him a renewed promise. Moses and the people would see God's almighty power and the Egyptians would feel it.
            耶和华藉着重新给摩西应许来坚立摩西的信心。摩西和人们将看到神的大能并且埃及人将经受这能力。
kecheng:    1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country.” What did God promise Moses? How would God help?
   2 God also said to Moses, “I am the LORD. 3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself fully known to them. What did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob not fully understand? 4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners. 5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant. Look at each verse in this section (vs.2-5). What truths did God state to support His claim that He loved and would deliver Israel?
1耶和华对摩西说：「现在你必看见我向法老所行的事，使他因我大能的手容以色列人去，且把他们赶出他的地。」神怎样应许摩西的？神将怎样帮助他们？
2神晓谕摩西说：「我是耶和华。3我从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各显现为全能的　神；至于我名耶和华，他们未曾知道。亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各未曾知道的是什么？4我与他们坚定所立的约，要把他们寄居的迦南地赐给他们。5我也听见以色列人被埃及人苦待的哀声，我也记念我的约。请查考本节的每一处经文（2-5节）。神陈明了什么真理来说明祂对以色列人的爱以及祂将要救赎以色列人的事实?
6 “Therefore, say to the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. What 3 things is the Lord going to do? 7 I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. 8 And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.’” Look at verses 7-8. Summarize the promise God makes in each verse?
6所以你要对以色列人说：『我是耶和华；我要用伸出来的膀臂重重地刑罚埃及人，救赎你们脱离他们的重担，不做他们的苦工。神将要做哪三样事？7我要以你们为我的百姓，我也要作你们的　神。你们要知道我是耶和华—你们的　神，是救你们脱离埃及人之重担的。8我起誓应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地，我要把你们领进去，将那地赐给你们为业。我是耶和华。』」查考7-8节，请总结神在每一节中所做的应许？
9 Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor. What prevented the Israelites from listening to Moses and accepting his message from God?
   10 Then the LORD said to Moses, 11 “Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country.” What familiar message is Moses suppose to deliver?
   12 But Moses said to the LORD, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?” What excuse does Moses make? Why do people's negative experiences (as discouragement or unfair treatment) tend to prevent them from listening to and following God's Word?
9摩西将这话告诉以色列人，只是他们因苦工愁烦，不肯听他的话。是什么阻碍了以色列人听从摩西并接受他从神而来的信息。
10耶和华晓谕摩西说：11「你进去对埃及王法老说，要容以色列人出他的地。」摩西要传达的是一则怎样的信息？
12摩西在耶和华面前说：「以色列人尚且不听我的话，法老怎肯听我这拙口笨舌的人呢？」摩西提出了什么借口？为什么人们的负面经历（如令人沮丧或不公平的对待）会阻止人听从并遵行神的话？
kecheng: Family Record of Moses and Aaron
摩西和亚伦的家谱
            This is a brief genealogy of the last 430 years. This is meant to call attention to the fact that Moses and Aaron deserve a hearing from the people. Notice at the end of verse 25, God has given a special emphasis on the sons of Levi.
这是过去430年的简要家谱。这是要人们知道，事实上，摩西和亚伦配得人们的听从。注意在25节的末尾，神特别强调了利未的子孙。
    13 Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
   14 These were the heads of their families:
   The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
   15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
   16 These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
   17 The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.
   18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
   19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
   These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
   20 Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
   21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri.
   22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.
   23 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
   24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
   25 Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.
   These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.
   26 It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.” 27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron. Why do you think verse 27 repeats the message in verse 26?
13耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦往以色列人和埃及王法老那里去，把以色列人从埃及地领出来。14以色列人家长的名字记在下面。以色列长子吕便的儿子是哈诺、法路、希斯伦、迦米；这是吕便的各家。15西缅的儿子是耶母利、雅悯、阿辖、雅斤、琐辖，和迦南女子的儿子扫罗；这是西缅的各家。16利未众子的名字按着他们的后代记在下面：就是革顺、哥辖、米拉利。利未一生的岁数是一百三十七岁。17革顺的儿子按着家室是立尼、示每。18哥辖的儿子是暗兰、以斯哈、希伯伦、乌薛。哥辖一生的岁数是一百三十三岁。19米拉利的儿子是抹利和母示；这是利未的家，都按着他们的后代。20暗兰娶了他父亲的妹妹约基别为妻，她给他生了亚伦和摩西。暗兰一生的岁数是一百三十七岁。21以斯哈的儿子是可拉、尼斐、细基利。22乌薛的儿子是米沙利、以利撒反、西提利。23亚伦娶了亚米拿达的女儿，拿顺的妹妹，以利沙巴为妻，她给他生了拿答、亚比户、以利亚撒、以他玛。24可拉的儿子是亚惜、以利加拿、亚比亚撒；这是可拉的各家。25亚伦的儿子以利亚撒娶了普铁的一个女儿为妻，她给他生了非尼哈。这是利未人的家长，都按着他们的家。26耶和华说：「将以色列人按着他们的军队从埃及地领出来。」这是对那亚伦、摩西说的。27对埃及王法老说要将以色列人从埃及领出来的，就是这摩西、亚伦。你认为27节为什么要重复26节的内容？
kecheng: Aaron to Speak for Moses
    28 Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt, 29 he said to him, “I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you.” What message  is Moses to give Pharaoh king of Egypt?
   30 But Moses said to the LORD, “Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?” What problem does Moses once again tell the Lord?
亚伦代摩西说话
28当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子，29他向摩西说：「我是耶和华；我对你说的一切话，你都要告诉埃及王法老。」摩西带给法老王的信息是什么？
30摩西在耶和华面前说：「看哪，我是拙口笨舌的人，法老怎肯听我呢？」摩西再次向耶和华提出什么问题？
