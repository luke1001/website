Exodus 4:1-31
出埃及记4:1-31
            Moses continues his objections to go to the Pharaoh to ask him to let the Israelites go.
摩西仍然不愿意去到法老那里向他要求放以色列人离开。
kecheng: Signs for Moses
    1 Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you’?” What is Moses third objection?
   2 Then the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?”
   “A staff,” he replied. Why would Moses have a staff?
   3 The LORD said, “Throw it on the ground.”
   Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. 4 Then the LORD said to him, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand. What miracle did the Lord perform? 5 “This,” said the LORD, “is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you.” What does God remind Moses?
   6 Then the LORD said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow. With what disease did the Lord afflict Moses?
   7 “Now put it back into your cloak,” he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh. What second miracle did the Lord perform?
   8 Then the LORD said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second. 9 But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground.” What third miracle did the Lord say he would perform?
   10 Moses said to the LORD, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” What is Moses fourth objection?
   11 The LORD said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 12 Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” How did God answer Moses?
   13 But Moses said, “Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else.” What was Moses fifth objection? Why would God choose someone who did not want to go?
   14 Then the LORD’s anger burned against Moses and he said, “What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you. 15 You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do. What was God's solution? Who is in charge? 16 He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him. 17 But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.” What does God give to Moses and for what reason? Does Moses have anymore objections?
神赐摩西行神迹的权能
1摩西回答说：「他们必不信我，也不听我的话，必说：『耶和华并没有向你显现。』」摩西第三个拒绝的理由是什么？
2耶和华对摩西说：「你手里是什么？」他说：「是杖。」摩西为什么拿着杖？
3耶和华说：「丢在地上。」他一丢下去，就变作蛇；摩西便跑开。4耶和华对摩西说：「伸出手来，拿住它的尾巴，它必在你手中仍变为杖；神行了怎样的神迹？5如此好叫他们信耶和华—他们祖宗的　神，就是亚伯拉罕的　神，以撒的　神，雅各的　神，是向你显现了。」神提醒了摩西什么事？
6耶和华又对他说：「把手放在怀里。」他就把手放在怀里，及至抽出来，不料，手长了大麻风，有雪那样白。神使摩西得了什么病？
7耶和华说：「再把手放在怀里。」他就再把手放在怀里，及至从怀里抽出来，不料，手已经复原，与周身的肉一样；神行的第二个神迹是什么？
8又说：「倘或他们不听你的话，也不信头一个神迹，他们必信第二个神迹。9这两个神迹若都不信，也不听你的话，你就从河里取些水，倒在旱地上，你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。」神说祂要行的第三个神迹是什么？
10摩西对耶和华说：「主啊，我素日不是能言的人，就是从你对仆人说话以后，也是这样。我本是拙口笨舌的。」摩西第四个拒绝的理由是什么？
11耶和华对他说：「谁造人的口呢？谁使人口哑、耳聋、目明、眼瞎呢？岂不是我—耶和华吗？12现在去吧，我必赐你口才，指教你所当说的话。」神怎样回答摩西的？
13摩西说：「主啊，你愿意打发谁，就打发谁去吧！」摩西第五个拒绝的理由是什么？神为什么会捡选一个不愿意去的人？
14耶和华向摩西发怒说：「不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗？我知道他是能言的；现在他出来迎接你，他一见你，心里就欢喜。15你要将当说的话传给他；我也要赐你和他口才，又要指教你们所当行的事。神的解决办法是什么？谁做负责人？16他要替你对百姓说话；你要以他当作口，他要以你当作　神。17你手里要拿这杖，好行神迹。」神赐予摩西什么？为什么？摩西还有更多的拒绝理由吗？
kecheng: Notes注释
Snake - Throughout much of Egypt's history the pharaoh wore a cobra made of metal on the front of his headdress as a symbol of his sovereignty.
蛇 - 在埃及大部分的历史里，法老都是带着一个金属制成的眼镜蛇在他的头巾上，作为他主权的标志。
kecheng: River will become blood - The Egyptians worshiped the river Mile as a god. If Moses could change its water into blood, he would thereby prove that his God was vastly superior to their idol.
河里取的水必在旱地上变作血-  埃及人把尼罗河当作神明来拜。如果摩西可以把河水变为血，他即证明他的神是比他们的偶像更有能力。
kecheng: Moses Returns to Egypt
    18 Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” How does Moses prepare to go to Egypt?
   Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”
   19 Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.” 20 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand. Who else went with Moses to Egypt? What did Moses take in his hand?
   21 The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. What surprising thing did God tell Moses? 22 Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, 23 and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” How does God regard Israel? But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’”What judgment will Moses deliver to Pharaoh?
   24 At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him. 25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it.It is not clear if the Lord sought Moses death or the death of the uncircumcised son. What did Zipporah do? Why was circumcision important? “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said. 26 So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.) Read note below. Go to Ex. 18:1-3
   27 The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him. What was Aaron's reaction when God spoke to him? 28 Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform. What did Moses tell Aaron?
   29 Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites, 30 and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people, 31 and they believed. How did the people respond to Moses and Aaron? And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped. How did the people honor God?
摩西返回埃及
18于是，摩西回到他岳父叶忒罗那里，对他说：「求你容我回去见我在埃及的弟兄，看他们还在不在。」摩西是如何预备去埃及的？
叶忒罗对摩西说：「你可以平平安安地去吧！」19耶和华在米甸对摩西说：「你要回埃及去，因为寻索你命的人都死了。」20摩西就带着妻子和两个儿子，叫他们骑上驴，回埃及地去。摩西手里拿着　神的杖。还有谁同摩西一同去埃及？摩西在手中拿着什么？
21耶和华对摩西说：「你回到埃及的时候，要留意将我指示你的一切奇事行在法老面前。但我要使他的心刚硬，他必不容百姓去。神告诉摩西的是怎样一件令人惊讶的事？22你要对法老说：『耶和华这样说：以色列是我的儿子，我的长子。23我对你说过：容我的儿子去，好事奉我。神怎样看待以色列人的？你还是不肯容他去。看哪，我要杀你的长子。』」摩西要带给法老王怎样的审判？
24摩西在路上住宿的地方，耶和华遇见他，想要杀他。25西坡拉就拿一块火石，割下他儿子的阳皮，丢在摩西脚前，这里并不清楚是神要杀摩西还是他未行割礼的儿子。西坡拉做了什么？为什么割礼如此重要？说：「你真是我的血郎了。」26这样，耶和华才放了他。西坡拉说：「你因割礼就是血郎了。」参看以下的注释，参照出埃及记18:1-3
27耶和华对亚伦说：「你往旷野去迎接摩西。」他就去，在　神的山遇见摩西，和他亲嘴。神向亚伦说话后，他是怎样回应的？28摩西将耶和华打发他所说的言语和嘱咐他所行的神迹都告诉了亚伦。摩西告诉亚伦什么事？
29摩西、亚伦就去招聚以色列的众长老。30亚伦将耶和华对摩西所说的一切话述说了一遍，又在百姓眼前行了那些神迹，31百姓就信了。人们是如何回应摩西和亚伦的？以色列人听见耶和华眷顾他们，鉴察他们的困苦，就低头下拜。人们是如何尊敬神的？
kecheng: Notes注释
Harden his heart - The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart only after the sixth plague. Prior to that, Pharaoh hardened his own heart against the Lord.
使他的心刚硬 -神刚硬法老的心是在六灾之后。在此之前，法老刚硬自己的心来抵挡神。
kecheng: Bridegroom of blood - This seems to indicate there was some conflict with Jethro and circumcision. Zipporah did not circumcise her son until a life was in danger.
血郎 - 这里似乎暗示叶忒罗和割礼之间有冲突，西坡拉并没有为他的儿子行割礼直到这个生命危急的时刻。
