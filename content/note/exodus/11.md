Exodus 11:1-10
出埃及记11:1-10
            The prediction of the last plague was given to Moses in Exodus 4:21-23.
21 The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go. 22 Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son, 23 and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’”
            在出埃及记4:21-23中已经将最后一灾的预言告诉了摩西。21耶和华对摩西说：「你回到埃及的时候，要留意将我指示你的一切奇事行在法老面前。但我要使他的心刚硬，他必不容百姓去。22你要对法老说：『耶和华这样说：以色列是我的儿子，我的长子。23我对你说过：容我的儿子去，好事奉我。你还是不肯容他去。看哪，我要杀你的长子。』」
kecheng: The Plague on the Firstborn
    1 Now the LORD had said to Moses, “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely. What will happen after the tenth and final plague?
 2 Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” 3 (The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people.) What should the Israelites ask for when they leave?
   4 So Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 5 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. Describe the tenth plague. Why was losing the firstborn even more difficult? 7 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.’ Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. 8 All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who follow you!’ What will Pharaoh tell Moses?  After that I will leave.” Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh. How do we reconcile Moses' conversation with Pharaoh in verses 4-8 with 10:28-29?
   9 The LORD had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you—so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt.” 10 Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country. Of what are we reminded?
头胎的灾殃
1耶和华对摩西说：「我再使一样的灾殃临到法老和埃及，然后他必容你们离开这地。他容你们去的时候，总要催逼你们都从这地出去。在第十个灾殃，这最后一个灾殃发生后会怎样？2你要传于百姓的耳中，叫他们男女各人向邻舍要金器银器。」3耶和华叫百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩，并且摩西在埃及地、法老臣仆，和百姓的眼中看为极大。以色列人在他们离开的时候要做什么?
4摩西说：「耶和华这样说：『约到半夜，我必出去巡行埃及遍地。5凡在埃及地，从坐宝座的法老直到磨子后的婢女所有的长子，以及一切头生的牲畜，都必死。6埃及遍地必有大哀号；从前没有这样的，后来也必没有。请描述第十灾。为什么头生的被击杀更加令人痛苦？7至于以色列中，无论是人是牲畜，连狗也不敢向他们摇舌，好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列人分别出来。』8你这一切臣仆都要俯伏来见我，说：『求你和跟从你的百姓都出去』法老将要对摩西说什么？，然后我要出去。」于是，摩西气忿忿地离开法老，出去了。我们要怎样调解摩西在4-8节和10:28-29中与法老的对话？
9 耶和华对摩西说：「法老必不听你们，使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。」10摩西、亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事；耶和华使法老的心刚硬，不容以色列人出离他的地。这里提醒我们了什么事？
kecheng: Notes注释
Not a dog will bark - When s severe storm approaches, animals hide and are silent; the dogs would not be noticed.
连狗也不敢向他们摇舌 – 当大动乱来临的时候，动物都安静的躲藏起来；狗也不会被注意到。
