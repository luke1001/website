There are a number of reasons why interactive learning is helpful in Bible study with adults:

1\. It helps students remember better what they learn.

它帮助学生更好地记住他们所学的知识

2\. It helps students understand the points of the lesson better.

它帮助学生更好地理解学习重点

3\. It leads the students to be more ready to share their Bible knowledge with others.

它引导学生更好地作好准备去与同其他学员分享圣经知识会

4\. It teaches the students Bible reading skills.

它教导学生查经技巧

5\. It motivates students to want to come back to Bible class again.

互动教学可以激发学生不断参加圣经课的愿望

1. It helps students remember better what they learn.**

    帮助学生更好地记住他们所学的知识

    Studies of people of all ages have shown that the more active people are in the study of something, the more they retain in their memory afterward. The following chart is a summary of these studies.

    对所有年龄段人群的研究表明，学习中越主动的人，能够长久记住的学习内容也就越多。以下是研究总结：

    • We remember 10% of what we learn by listening.

    藉着听讲，我们能记住所学知识的百分之十

    • We remember 15% of what we listen to and repeat.

    藉着听讲和复述，我们能记住所学知识的百分之十五

    • We remember 20% of what we listen to and see.

    藉着听讲和观察，我们能记住所学知识的百分之二十

    • We remember 30% if we answer questions about what we hear and see.

    如果我们回答与听到和看到内容有关的问题，我们能记住所学知识的百分之三十

    • We remember 40% if we discuss with others what we hear and see.

    如果我们小组讨论听到和看到的内容，我们能记住所学知识的百分之四十

    • We remember 50% if we create something that relates to what we learned.

    如果我们有与所学内容相关的创新性思维，我们能记住所学知识的百分之五十

    • We remember 65% if we in turn teach others what we learned.

    如果我们将所学的内容教授给他人，我们能记住所学知识的百分之六十五

2. It helps students understand the points of the lesson better.

    它有助于学生们更好地理解课堂重点

    When the students tell others what they are learning, it is easy for the teacher to discover any misunderstandings they may have and correct them. The students also have the chance to ask other class members about something they don't fully understand and get it straightened out.

    当学生和其他学员分享所学内容时，老师更容易发现学习中存在的误解并且纠正他们。学生也有机会向其他学员就不理解的问题提问并且当堂得到答案。

3. It leads the students to be more ready to share his Bible knowledge with others.

    它引导学生更好地作好准备去与其他学员分享圣经知识

    People who have never talked out loud to anyone about their faith are not going to be very confident to say something when they have the opportunity. On the other hand, people who talk about the Bible with one another in class will be more ready to do so outside of class as well.

    对于从没有说大声出自己信仰的人来说，当他们有机会去说些什么的时候也会缺乏自信。另一方面，在课堂上相互谈论圣经的人们也会更愿意在课堂外谈论圣经。

4. It teaches the students Bible reading skills.

    它教导学生查经技巧

    In an interactive Bible class, students learn to focus on key points and to use them in comparing or evaluating things. As they practice comparing one Bible passage with another, comparing something from their lives with a Bible truth, evaluating a statement someone makes on the basis of a Bible passage or truth – all these learned skills will help them do more useful personal Bible reading.

    在组员相互交流的圣经课里，学生们学习专注在课堂主旨上并且能够运用他们来比较和评价事物。组员之间在练习比较圣经段落，用圣经真理同他们自己的生活做比较，并且评价某人以圣经段落或是真理为基础所做的陈述 – 所有这些技巧都会帮助他们提高独立阅读圣经的能力。

5. It makes the student want to come back to Bible class again.

    它激发学生想不断参加圣经课的愿望

The best reason for coming to Bible class is to learn more about God our Savior and his inspired Word. But being able to discuss God's Word with fellow Christians who share their faith is an added joy for a Christian. If the class learns to use the Bible to solve problems, this will be another powerful reason for coming to class. It convinces the Christians that God's Word does apply to their daily life in many important ways.

我们参加圣经课最好的理由就是去学习关于上帝我们的救主和他启示的话语。然而，能够和其他基督徒一起讨论神的话语并且分享彼此的信心又增添了做基督徒的喜悦。如果圣经课学习用圣经来解决问题，那么这便成为又一个吸引学员的有力因素。这使基督徒们确信上帝的话语的确能通过很多重要途径适用在他们每天的生活当中。

**USING ALL THE SENSES:** The paragraph in the middle of page 15 gives some interesting statistics about what students remember. The bottom line is this – human beings have five senses – seeing, hearing, smelling, touching and tasting. It is through these five senses that information is passed to our brains. The more of these senses that are being used in learning, the more the brain remembers. Using pictures, videos and music, having the class act out a story, using props – all of these can be valuable helps in involving the five senses in learning.

**利用所有感知：** 第15页的中间一段给出了一些关于学生记忆的统计数据。概括起来就是 – 人类有五种感知 – 看，听，闻，触摸，品尝。 通过这五种感知，信息被传达到我们的大脑。 在学习中利用的感知越多大脑记忆便越强。运用图像，视频和音乐，请课堂利用小道具来演绎圣经故事 – 所有的这些都能够帮助五种感知都参与到学习过程当中。

Exercise 7: Think of a way to involve all five senses in a Bible lesson about Jesus' birth?

练习7: 请想出一种方法在圣经课上利用五种感知来讲述耶稣的降生？

**GROUP DISCUSSION:** One of the best ways to insure your students are all active in learning is to have them do some group activity. Having the students discuss the subject is one common way. However the teacher must still ensure that proper learning is taking place. Read sections A, B, and C of Reading 3: Interactive Learning. Then answer the following questions.

**小组讨论：** 确保你的学生在课堂上的主动性的最好方法就是请他们做一些小组活动。 请组员就某一话题展开讨论是很常见的方式。不过老师也要始终确保正确的学习仍在进行。 阅览阅读3互动式学习的A,B, 和C段，然后回答以下问题。

a. What problems might develop in group discussions?

小组讨论中可能会出现的问题？

b. How can a teacher make sure the class does not merely turn into an opinion sharing session?

教师如何确保课堂不会变成一个仅仅是分享观点的讲习会。

c. List the four responsibilities of the teacher in interactive discussions.

请列出教师在互动讨论中的四个责任。
