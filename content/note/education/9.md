**Introduction: What are some arguments people give why abortion should be allowed by the government?**
**引言：人们对于政府为什么应该允许堕胎的问题有何争论？**

**Theme: What About Abortion?**
**主题：堕胎会怎样？**

1. Why does God create life?

    神为什么创造生命？

    **Background:** In Psalm 139:16, the writer talks about how God's eyes saw his unformed body and had already determined how long his life would be.

    **背景：** 诗篇139:16,作者讲到神的眼早已看见他未成形的体质，早已决定他的寿命。

    **Key Verse:** Look at 1 Timothy 2:4. God's will is that all people come to know Jesus as their Savior. Explain what this fact has to do with abortion.

    **关键经句：** 参看提摩太前书2:4.神的旨意是要所有人认识耶稣为他们的救主。请解释这个事实和堕胎有什么关系。

    **Application:** Evaluate: since the matter of salvation is involved when we talk about abortion, our synod's congregations should publicly oppose abortion and work to pass laws to make it illegal.

    **应用：**评价：既然救恩与我们谈论的堕胎有关，我们教会的会众应该公开反对堕胎，致力于通过法律使堕胎成为违法行为。

    **Illustration:** Passing laws against drunkenness, adultery, etc., doesn't stop people from doing these things. Laws are not the real answer. People's hearts need to be changed. So it is with abortion.

    **说明：** 制定法律反对醉酒、奸淫等等并不能阻止人们做这些事情。法律不是真正的办法。人们的心需要改变。堕胎的问题也是如此。

    **1a. Answer:** God creates life so that people can live with him eternally in heaven.

    **答案：**神创造生命以便人能在天国永远与神生活在一起。

2. What does God say about the fetus in the womb?

    神对于腹中的胎儿是怎么说的？

    **Background:** In Jer. 1:5, God tells Jeremiah that he formed him in the womb, knew him and set him apart as a prophet to the nations. In Ps. 139:13, God is pictured as knitting the writer's inner organs together in him. In Lk. 1:41, Luke says John jumped in his mother's womb when he heard Mary's greeting!

    **背景：** 耶利米书1:5 ,神告诉耶利米他将耶利米造在腹中，晓得他，并将他分别为圣做列国的先知。在诗139:13,神被描述成作者肺腑的缔造者。路1:41,路加说约翰听见玛利亚问安时，在母腹中跳跃！

    **Key Verse:** Read Exod. 21:22-24. Show how these verses tell us that God considered the fetus in a mother's womb to be a human being.

    **关键经句：** 读出埃及记21:22-24.指出这些经文怎样告诉我们神将母腹中的胎儿作为人看待。

    **Application:** Some who call themselves Christians defend abortion by saying that since Scripture nowhere expressly forbids abortion, this issue remains an open question. How would you answer this argument?

    **应用：** 有些自称为基督徒的人为堕胎辩护，认为既然圣经中没有一处明确地反对堕胎，这个问题就是个未决问题。你怎样回答这个意见？

    **Illustration:** Scripture doesn't expressly forbid killing with a gun either.

    **说明：** 圣经也没有明确地禁止用枪杀人。

    **2a. Answer:** God says that the fetus in the womb is a human being.

    **答案：** 神说腹中的胎儿就是人。

3. What does God say about who should decide when a human life should end?

    谁能决定一个人的性命何时结束的问题，神是怎么说的？

    **Background:** In Php. 1:21-24, Paul says he is torn between going to be with Christ or remaining here in the body which is more necessary for his followers.

    **背景：** 在腓1:21-24,保罗说他在两难之间：离世与耶稣同在和在肉身活着，后者对信徒来说更是要紧。

    **Key Verse:** Show how Acts 17:25-27 indicates in several ways that a human being's life is something we are not to tinker with in any way.

    **关键经文：** 说明使徒行传17:25-27怎样以几种方式指出人的性命不是我们能以任何方式修整的。

    **Application:** What's wrong here? Many doctors agree that a fetus is not a human being until it can live independently of its mother's womb. This is a scientific fact that must be considered in determining when an abortion is a sin.

    **应用：** 问题出在哪里？很多医生认为一个胎儿直到它能不依赖于母腹生存才是一个人。当决定堕胎是罪的时候，这是个必须考虑的科学事实。

    **Illustration:** In the name of science, many people say that homosexuality is just an alternative lifestyle, that the world came in to being as the result of evolution, ect.

    **说明：** 以科学的名义，许多人认为同性恋只是另一种生活方式，世界的形成是进化论的结果。

    **3a. Answer:** God says that only he is to decide when a human life should end.

    **答案：** 神说只有他能决定人的生命何时结束。

**Summary:** Let's have somebody summarize for us the answer God gives in his Word to the question: What about abortion?

**总结：** 让我们请某个同学为我们总结神怎样用他的话语来回答这个问题：堕胎会怎样？
