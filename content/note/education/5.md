**Problem 1: Some people don't participate**
**问题1 : 有些学生不参与讨论**

This may be because those people:

这或许是由于那些学生：

• did not understand the development of the biblical truth and so lack the knowledge to take part in discussing the point

• are used to sitting and listening

• are afraid of embarrassing themselves by not giving the “right” answer

• are not exactly sure what they want to say and so often stammer when speaking

• are reacting on the spot to what others have said and do not have enough time to gather their thoughts before speaking

• are not given enough time by the teacher to think and answer

• 不明白圣经真理的发展所以没有足够的知识来参与讨论

• 习惯了坐着听讲不发言

• 害怕或者觉得如果说的不对会很尴尬

• 并不完全确定自己要说什么所以说起来的时候磕磕巴巴

• 自己想到的答案被别人先说了，在回答问题前又没有足够的时间整理思绪

• 老师没有给予足够的时间思考和回答。

If the Bible truth that was developed is a more difficult or complicated one, use an illustration to make it clear before going to the discussion and application.

如果正在学的圣经真理比较复杂难懂， 用一个实例对它做清晰的解释之后再让大家进行讨论和实际应用。

Use breakout groups to give people a chance to express themselves in a small group first and then make their contribution to the whole group discussion with the support of two or three others.

先用分小组讨论给大家更多机会在小组里阐述自己的想法，然后再让他们在两到三个同组组员的支持下参加全组的讨论。

Show that there may be several “right” answers to the point being discussed.

要说明被讨论的话题可能会有几种“正确”答案

Give people a minute or two so they can each write down their thoughts on the point being discussed. If no one volunteers to speak after one person has reacted, allow 5 or 10 seconds to pass, tell the group that there is more that could be said on that point. Don't be afraid to call on those who may look like they want to speak.

给大家一两分钟让他们写下自己对讨论的要点的想法。当有人回应之后如果没有别人自告奋勇作答，等待5-10秒钟， 然后告诉小组该要点还有更多可以被挖掘的答案。不要害怕去叫那些看起来有话要说的同学作答。

**Problem 2: Comments that are unscriptural**
**问题2:与《圣经》不相符的评论**

There will be times when a person makes a partly or totally unscriptural comment during the discussion.

在讨论中，有时人们会做一些部分或全部与《圣经》不相符的评论。

If any part of what the person said was scriptural, point that out first. Then repeat the Bible passage or the biblical truth which helps clear up or correct the matter in the light of this passage or truth. If the person who made the mistake wishes to make a correction in what was said, allow that person to do so （if you are sure that person won't make the matter worse）。 Or, if the class has previously used discussions to correct each other by using the biblical truth just developed, let them discuss it. If they do not clear it up, then the teacher must gently correct the misunderstanding before going any further.

如果那个人说的其中任何一部分是符合圣经的，首先将它指出来，然后重复圣经中的真理或相关经文并结合该圣经段落或其中的真理来澄清或纠正这样的评论。如果那个答错问题的人希望重新修改他的答案，那么请允许他修改（如果你确定他不会将问题越答越糟）。又或者，如果课堂上之前已经有人通过讨论用该圣经真理修正彼此的错误，那么就让他们和那个人一起讨论。如果他们无法将问题解答弄清楚，这时老师就应该即刻温婉的纠正他的错误，以免更糟的情况出现。

**Problem 3: One or two people control the whole discussion**
**问题3:一、二个学生控制整个讨论**

Sometimes one or two people begin to control the whole discussion by repeatedly asking to speak, giving long comments, and not allowing others to participate.

有时候一两个人会开始操控整个讨论因为他们不断的要求发言，做冗长的评论而且不允许其他人加入讨论。

To solve this problem, call on people who are not asking to speak but whom you are quite sure will have something to say.

为解决这样的问题，点名让那些虽没有要求发言但你很确信他们有东西可以分享的人发言。

Politely cut in on the speaker （“thank you, John”） and ask another person to comment.

礼貌的打断不停在说的人（谢谢你，约翰）然后邀请其他同学发表意见。

Use breakout groups frequently and do not make this person a leader or reporter for a group so this person sees that others would like to contribute also.

时常地利用分组讨论并且不要使经常控制整个讨论发言的人成为小组组长或者报告员，这样一来那个人就会发觉其他人也愿意参与讨论并作出自己的贡献

If the problem continues, speak privately with the person to explain that you are using interactive learning to get all the people involved in sharing Scripture with each other.

如果这样的问题还是存在，私下和这个人谈谈，向他解释你利用互动学习的目的是希望每个人都有机会参与和彼此分享圣经

**USING QUESTIONS:** Interaction almost always involves questions. In a good class teachers will ask students questions, students will ask teachers questions and students will discuss questions among themselves. But, not all questions are created equal. There are at least seven different types of questions that a good teacher will use.

**运用问题：** 互动几乎总是离不开问题。 在一个良好的课堂环境里，老师会向学生提问，学生也会向老师提问并且也会在其他人之间讨论问题。但并非所有问题都平等。一个好老师会用使用至少七种不同的问题。

Read Types of Questions in Reading 5. Which of the dos and don'ts do you think you will have to be most careful to avoid?

阅览阅读5中问题的种类。其中哪一项 做与不做 你认为自己将会最小心地回避？

Read about the four categories of questions in Reading 5. Note that there are seven types of questions which are discussed under the four categories.

阅览阅读5里问题的四个分类。注意在四个分类里共讨论了七种问题。
