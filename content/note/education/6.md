**The use of questions**
**问题的使用**

There are a number of basic things to do and not to do when using questions:

在使用问题上面有几件应做和不应作的事情：

• Do plan your questions, starting with the simple ones and leading in a logical way to the more complex ones.

• Don't use more than three or four questions in a row.

• Don't ask questions that need more than one answer at a time.

• Do spread the questions around the class to get everyone active and involved.

• Don't ask questions that need only a “yes” or “no” answer.

• Don't ignore answers that are partly or totally wrong.

• 要计划好问题，从最简单的开始，按逻辑发展至更加复杂的问题。

• 不要连续使用多于三个或四个问题

• 不要提需要一个以上答案的问题

• 要将问题在课堂中传递让每个人都能积极参与

• 不要提仅需要 是 或 否 就能够解决的问题

• 不要忽略部分或者完全错误的答案

**Category One: Echoing Questions**
**类别一：回应性问题**

（Types One and Two）

（第一种和第二种）

Note: In the diagrams with each type question, the letters which are not encircled represent what the teacher presents to the class. The circled letter or symbol represents what the teacher is asking the class to do in answering the question.

注意：在示意图里的每种问题，没有被包围的字母表示老师对全班的讲授。被圈起来的字母或符号表示老师对全班的提问。

Type One The teacher gives the class something and asks the class to give the same things back in exactly the same words as it was given to the class. This requires little thinking, since the question merely asks that something the teacher or book said be repeated.

第一种 老师传授课堂一些知识并要求课堂把他所教的以完全一致的词语反馈给他。这只需要稍稍动下脑子，因为回答的问题只不过是重复老师或者教案所讲的知识而已。

Type Two The teacher gives the class something and asks the class to give the same thing back in slightly altered form. A little more thinking is required in this type of question because the student has to rephrase what the teacher said.

第二种 老師传授课堂知识并且要求课堂对知识稍做替换来回答问题。这需要多一些的思考因为学生得用自己的语言重新陈述老师教授的知识。

**Category Two: Comparing Questions**
**类别二： 比较性问题**

（Types Three and Four）

（第三种和第四种）

Type Three The teacher gives the class two or more things and asks the class to explain how these items relate to each other （B explains or expands on or differs from A）。 More thinking is involved because the student must compare several items and then make an original statement about how they relate.

第三种 老师交给课堂两或三件事情然后请同学来解释几件事情彼此间的联系 （B解释、拓展、或相异于A）。需要更多的思考因为学生一定要比较几件事物之后自己陈述他们之间的关联。

Type Four In type four an additional step precedes a type three question. Before the teacher asks the class to compare several items, he first asks the class to recall something learned earlier. A little more thinking is involved because the students have to supply one of the items to be used in the comparison before the comparing can begin.

第四种 第四类问题是在第三类问题的基础上多加一个前奏。在老师请同学比较几样事物事前需要首先请同学回忆之前学习过的知识。 这又需要更多的思考因为学生必须在进行比较之前提供一件之前学过的知识。

**Category Three: Evaluating Questions**
**类别三： 评估性问题**

（Types Five and Six）

（第五种和第六种）

Type Five The teacher puts something in front of the class and then gives an evaluation of the item. Then he asks the class to prove why his evaluation is the correct one. A good deal of thinking is involved because this requires the class to recall one or more things they have already learned. Then they must use them in a logical way to prove the teacher's value judgment.

第五种 老师对课堂提出一项事物并且就此进行评价。之后学生要向老师证明为何他所作的评判是正确的。这要求大量的思考因为需要学生回忆许多之前学过的知识，并且需要照逻辑合理地使用他们来证明老师对事物的评判是否正确。

Type Six In type six an additional step is given to a type five question. The teacher does not make the value judgment, but asks the class to do this. Then the teacher asks the class to prove its value judgment as a type five question. This gives the class a bit more of a challenge because a proper value judgment has to be made before the proof begins.

第六种 第六类比第五类多出一步。老师不对事物做评价，而是请同学来做出自己的评判。之后老师请学生用第五类里的方式去证明自己的评价。这给同学更多的挑战因为在他们进行证明的时候需要先对此有一个恰当的评判。

**Category Four: Creating Questions**
**类别四： 创新性问题**

（Type Seven）

（第七种）

Type Seven The teacher asks the class to produce an original project which relates to the lesson or a part of the lesson. This requires the student to do some totally independent thinking about what the lesson means to him or her.

第七种 老师请学生原创一个有关主题或部分学习内容的项目。学生需要完全独立思考课堂对他/她的意义。

Exercise 8: Read the story of Jesus feeding the 5,000 in Mark 6:30-44. Then write one question of each of the seven types for an adult Bible class.

练习8:阅读马可福音 六章30-44节里耶稣使五千人吃饱的故事。之后就前面讲到的成人圣经课的七类问题，各写出一个提问。

D. Communicating to the heart （appropriation and application）

对心的交流（借鉴和应用）

As Bible study teacher you must always remember that you are not just communicating knowledge to your students' heads, but also to their hearts. Study Reading 6 which talks about the three facets of learning.

作为教导圣经学习课的老师，你必须要时刻记住你不但要将知识传授到学生们头脑中，而且更要知识传授到他们的心里。学习《阅读6》中谈到的有关学习的三个方面。
