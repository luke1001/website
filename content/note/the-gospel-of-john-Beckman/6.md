Lesson 7 – Jesus is the Bread of Life
第七课—耶稣是生命的粮
John 6 约翰福音第六章
Getting Started John 5 had ended with Jesus’ conversation with his enemies following the healing of the lame man, mostly like at the Feast of Tabernacles, which took place in autumn. John 6 takes place at the time of Passover, which would be the following spring. John does not consider it necessary to report all the events of Jesus’ Galilean ministry. John is developing his theme that Jesus is the Son of God and the Giver of eternal life. The “signs” demonstrate that. Jesus’ words in chapter 5 following the miracle helped show that miracle as a true sign from heaven pointing to Jesus as the Savior. We find the very same thing in John 6.
内容简介: 约翰福音第五章以耶稣在医治瘫子后跟他的敌对者的对话来做结束，这事大概发生在秋季的住棚节约翰福音第六章发生在逾越节，也就是第二年的春天。约翰觉得没必要将耶稣在加利利所做的福音事工都一一述说。约翰所写的主题是耶稣是神的儿子和永生的赐予者。耶稣所行的“神迹”也证明这一点。耶稣在第五章施行神迹后所说的话表明神迹是从天上来的，为要显明耶稣是救主。在第六章中情况也是如此。
