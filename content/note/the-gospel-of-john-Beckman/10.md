第十一课--耶稣好牧人
John 10 约翰福音第十章
Getting Started From the beginning of chapter 7 to verse 21 of John 10, Jesus is in Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles. The time was late September or early October in the autumn before his death and resurrection. John 10:1 therefore continues where Jesus left off at the end of chapter 9. When we get to 10:22 a new time reference appears – The Feast of Dedication. This was Hanukkah or the Festival of Lights, which Jews celebrate to this day in mid-December. The festival remembers the rededication of the temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV in 165 B.C. Though about two months had passed since Jesus’ words in the first half of John 10, he returns to that familiar theme of him as shepherd and his followers as sheep. In the second half of the chapter we see the conversation between Jesus and his enemies turn to the central theme of John’s gospel – Jesus is the true Son of God, one with the Father.
内容简介 从约翰福音第七章开始到十章21节，耶稣都在耶稣耶路撒冷过住棚节。时间应该是他受死和复活之前的秋天的九月末或十月初。因此约翰福音10：1接续九章结尾所记述关于耶稣的事。10：22节是一个新的时间上的里程碑的开始—修殿节。也就是犹太人的光明节，犹太人直到今天还在每年的12月中旬来庆祝这个节日。犹太人过这个节日是为了记念于主前165年被安提古斯亵渎后的圣殿的重献。尽管距耶稣在十章前半部分说话的时间已经有两个月之久，他在这里又重提他是牧人而信徒是羊这个熟悉的话题。在本章的后半部分我们看到耶稣和他的敌人的谈话开始围绕约翰福音的中心主题—耶稣是神的真儿子，跟父是合一的。
