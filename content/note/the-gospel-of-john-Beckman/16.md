第十七课—应许的圣灵
The Gospel According to John
约翰福音
Lesson 17 – The Promised Spirit
第17课——应许的圣灵
John 16:1-16 约翰福音16:1-16
Getting Started – Chapter 16 brings us to the end of Jesus’ farewell sermon in the Upper Room. (Chapter 17 brings the Upper Room conversation to an end with Jesus’ prayer for the church.) The conclusion to this most important sermon is full of important reminders for Jesus’ disciples: they will be persecuted, but he has overcome the world; his departure would bring the promised Spirit; their grief over his departure would be turned to joy in the gospel. Those same promises strengthen us as we press on with his saving work in the church militant. (16:17-33 and chapter 17 have been covered already in Course C on Christ’s Passion History.)
内容简介 —— 第16章结束耶稣在马可楼的告别训诫。（第17章以耶稣为教会的祷告作为马可楼谈话的结束）这个最重要的训诫对于耶稣的门徒们充满重要提醒：他们将被迫害，但耶稣已胜了世界；他的离开将带来应许的圣灵；他们在他离去时的忧伤将在福音中变成喜乐。当我们在争战的教会中推进救赎工作时，这些同样的应许给我们以力量。（16:17-33和第17章在关于基督受难历史的课程C中已经涵盖。）

3. In verses 8-11 Jesus says the Holy Spirit will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment. He then gives reasons for each one of those convictions. State each of those three reasons in your own words.
在 8-11节中耶稣说圣灵就要叫世人为罪、为义、为审判，自己责备自己。然后他分别对此给出理由。请用你自己的话陈述这三个理由。
In regard to sin, because men do not believe in me.
为罪、是因他们不信我；
In regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father.
为义，是因我将要到父那里去。
In regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
