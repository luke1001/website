第十四课—谦卑服侍和预言
The Gospel According to John
约翰福音
Lesson 14 – Humble Service and Predictions
第14课 —— 谦卑服侍和预言
John 13 约翰福音第 13章
Getting Started – The triumphal entry into Jerusalem had taken place in chapter 12. John includes in the remainder of that chapter some of the dialogue Jesus had with the crowds in Jerusalem during what we call “Holy Week.” But John does not include nearly as much as the synoptic authors. John even omits any reference to the Lord’s Supper at the Passover meal. John assumes his readers are familiar with the content of the other gospels, so he does not feel it is necessary to repeat what they had written. He is more concerned about Jesus’ farewell address to his disciples. This is the content of most of chapters 13 through 17. In recording this address, John shifts Jesus’ attention from the Jewish nation (chapters 1-12) to his followers, who would share his mission with the unbelieving world after his death and resurrection (chapters 13-21).
内容简介 —— 耶稣荣入耶路撒冷发生在第12章。约翰在该章末尾加入耶稣在“受难周”期间与众人的部分谈话。但是，约翰并没有像其他福音书作者记述的那么详细。他甚至对主在逾越节的晚餐没有任何记载。约翰认为读者们已熟悉其它福音书中的内容，觉得不必再重复。他更关注耶稣对门徒的道别讲话。这是贯穿第13章至17章的最主要内容。关于这个讲话，约翰把耶稣对犹太民族的关注（第1-12章）转投到门徒身上。在耶稣受死并复活（第13至21章）之后，在这个不信的世界中门徒们将担当耶稣的使命。
Jesus Washes His Disciples’ Feet 13:1 – 17
耶稣为门徒洗脚13：1-17
Things to Note:
注意事项：
v. 1 The end of verse 1 in the Greek says, “He loved them to the end,” or “He loved them to completion.” Does this give us new insight into the meaning of the verse?
