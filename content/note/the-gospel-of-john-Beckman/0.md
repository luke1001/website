第一课—约翰福音的序言， 约1：1-18
Getting Started The gospel of John begins differently than the three “synoptic” gospels. Matthew begins with Jesus’ genealogy. Mark jumps right into Jesus’ ministry. Luke lays the background for Jesus’ birth through the angel’s announcements to Zechariah and Mary. John, however, elevates his writing to a different level. He trusts that his readers are familiar with the other three gospels, so he does not repeat their material. He rather begins with a theological treatise on Jesus’ origin and the purpose of his coming to earth. He does this to dismiss some of the false notions of Gnosticism (“gnosis” = “knowledge”) that were affecting the church at the time he wrote these words. In so doing, he introduces the reader to the purpose of this book – to see that Jesus is God’s true Son, the Word made flesh, who came to give life to the believer.
起头：約翰福音的开头與其它三個福音書不同。馬太福音以耶穌的家譜開始。马可福音開始于耶穌的事工。路加福音以天使向Zechariah 和马利亚 宣告耶穌降生的訊息為背景展開。約翰福音卻是從另一個更高的層面來講述的。他從神學的角度論述耶穌的出身以及他來到世間的目的。他以這樣的方式來消除诺斯替教的錯誤觀念對當時教會的影響。如此他便向讀者介紹了此書的目的 – 認識耶穌為神的兒子，他道成肉身，他来到世上为的是要将生命赐给信他的人。。。。。
A. The Word was God 1:1-3
A. 道就是神
1. What would John’s first readers have thought of when they read the words in the beginning?
約翰福音的第一批讀者们會对“太初”作何感想？
2. How do we know John is talking about Jesus Christ when he speaks of the Word?
當約翰講到上帝話語（道）的時候我們如何知道他是在談論耶穌？
3. Gnosticism was an attempt to use biblical terms to teach an intellectual philosophy. This philosophy rejected the notion that Jesus was God or that people needed a Savior from sin. The Greek term for “word” is “logos.” The following paragraph is how a Gnostic understood “logos.”
诺斯替教曾試圖用聖經的典故去教導智慧的哲學。這種哲學拒絕耶穌就是上帝，或人類需要救世主的理論。希臘文里“話語”就是“logos”。下面一段是诺斯替教对 “logos”的理解。
Logos: often translated as "word", its true meaning is much more multifunctional (a better translation would be "reason"). The Logos is the light that gives Gnosis via communication. It is the Christ (not to be confused with Jesus). First there was a thought, then the word. We pass on knowledge in this world through words. It is something that gives us guidance by "seeing" or a certain amount of comprehension. (from Gnostic Glossary by Karl Nygren)
Logos:常被译成“道”，它的真实含义则包括了更多的功能（“理性”将是一个更好的翻译）。Logos是藉由交通带来灵知的光。它是基督（不要与耶稣相混淆）。先有思想，然后有道。在世上我们通过话语传递知识。它藉由“看见”或一定的领悟来引导我们。
What is John saying by referring to Jesus as the Word (logos)? 约翰称耶稣为道（Logos）是什么意思？
4. How does John emphasize that the Word is distinct from the Father?
約翰是如何強調“道”和父之間的區別的？
5. Summarize what verses 1-3 say about who the Word is, what the Word is like, and what the Word has done.
概括1－3節里所說的 誰是“道”， “道”是甚麼樣子，以及“道”成就了甚麼。
B. The Word was the true Light 1:4-13
B. 道是真光
6. Gnostics sought spiritual enlightenment similar to some forms of today’s Hinduism. How does John explain the connection among the Word, life, and light?
诺斯替教所尋求的精神啓蒙與當今的印度教有所相似。 約翰是怎樣解释“道”、生命以及光之間的聯繫的？
7. How does verse 5 apply to the world in John’s day and to the world today? How have you witnessed this truth in your own life?
第五節如何反映到約翰所处的世代以及當今世界的？ 你是如何在自己的生命中为真理作見證的？
8. Which “John” is referred to in verse 6? John the Baptist
第六節里的約翰講得是那位？
9. How do verses 7-9 describe John’s ministry and its relationship to Jesus’ ministry?
第7－9小節是如何來描述約翰的事工以及它同耶穌事工之間的關係的？
10. Give examples from the gospels that show what John means in verses 10-11.
舉例說明約翰福音10－11小節的涵義。
11. How do verses 12-13 describe the relationship one has with God through Jesus Christ?
第12－13節描述了藉着耶稣基督人與神之间是怎样的關係？
12. What other passages do you think of when you read the words born of God?
當讀到“从神生的”的時候還想起了其它的哪些信息？
C. The Word Became Flesh 1:14-18
C. 道成肉身
13. What other passages of Scripture would help us understand the statement the Word became flesh?
還有哪些章節能夠幫助我們明白“道成肉身”？
14. In Greek the word for “lived” means “pitched his tent (or tabernacle).” Why is that a good way to describe the earthly ministry of Jesus? How might that also describe our life on this earth?
希臘文里 “住”意思是“安扎帐篷（或会幕）”為甚麼這是一個好的方式來描述耶穌在世上的事工？它又如何描述了我们在这世上的生命？
15. How did the apostle John see the glory of God’s “one and only”? (“One and only” refers not merely to number but to uniqueness; “one of a kind.”)
使徒約翰是如何看待 神“独生子”的榮光？“独生子”不單單指數量更強調它的獨特，“謹此一物”。
16. Why is it so significant to say that God’s Son is full of grace and truth? (See Ephesians 2:9; John 8:31-32, 44-46; 17:17; 18:37)
為何說神独生子“充充满满的有恩典有真理” 是如此重要？（参阅以弗所书2：9；约翰福音8：31-32，44-46；17：17；18：37）
17. How does verse 15 say the same thing as verses 1-2?
15節為何與1－2節在講同樣的事情？
18. A literal translation of verse 16 says, From his fullness we have all received grace in exchange for grace. Use verse 17 to explain what verse 16 means.
對16節字面上的翻譯是，从他的丰盛里，我们都领受了从恩典换来的恩典。用17节解释16节的意思。
19. What is the contrast John is setting up in verse 17? What does he mean by grace and truth?
約翰在17節里做了怎樣的對比？他所說恩典和真理是何意？
20. Verse 18 contains a variant reading. Some manuscripts read “God the only Son,” but the better reading seems to be this: The one and only God, who is in the Father’s lap, that one has told the whole story.
What is John emphasizing in this verse? (This underscores the book’s theme.)
第18節有多種讀法。有些手稿講“上帝的独生子”但對此更好的理解是：独一的神，在父的膝下，将整个故事讲出来。
約翰在此節中強調了甚麼？（这强调了约翰福音的主题）
21. Give a summary of how this introduction has prepared us for reading the story of Jesus.
總結這段介紹幫我們接下來閱讀耶穌的故事做了那些準備？
