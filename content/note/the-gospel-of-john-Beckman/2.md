Lesson 3 – The Wedding at Cana, Clearing the Temple , John 2:1-25
第三课—迦拿的婚宴，洁净圣殿 , 约2：1-25
Getting Started: There are different ways of studying a piece of literature. Some commentators have looked at John’s emphasis on the signs performed by Jesus in 1:19 – 12:50 and have called this section of John’s gospel The Signs of the Messiah. This title emphasizes that John wrote this part of his gospel to show that Jesus was the true Messiah, and that his miraculous signs proved this important point. Though we are not following that outline specifically, we want to take note of how John uses the term sign 17 times in the gospel, the first two of which are found in 2:11 and 2:23. The signs point to Jesus as the Christ (Messiah), the true and eternal Son of God, and the Savior of the world. That is John’s point from the beginning to the end of this beautiful story. 内容简介：不同的人读一卷书视角不尽相同。有的人看到约翰在1：19到12：50中大篇幅对耶稣神迹的记述而称约翰福音的这一部分为“弥赛亚神迹”。这个名字强调约翰写这一部分是为了显明耶稣是真弥赛亚，他所行的神迹也证明这一要点。尽管我们不是严格按照这个主题展开，我们还是要注意到约翰在福音书中使用“神迹”一词达17次之多，最早两次就在2：11和2：23. 这些神迹都指明耶稣即是基督（弥赛亚），他真是上帝永恒的儿子和这个世界的救主。这就是约翰在这个美丽的传记中从始至终所阐述的一个主旨。
2:1-11 The Wedding at Cana 迦拿的婚宴
1. What happened three days before the wedding at Cana?
在迦拿婚宴前三天发生过什么事情？
2. Verses 2 – 5 give us hints concerning two things: A) Why Jesus was at the wedding, and B) what Mary may have expected of Jesus. Explain each of those two points:
2-5节给我们关于两件事的提示：A）为什么耶稣会参加婚宴，和B）马利亚期望耶稣做什么。请分别叙述：
3. Which six disciples were most likely with Jesus at this point?
当时最有可能跟耶稣在一起的六个使徒是谁？
4. Concerning the Greek word for wine (oi’nos): Some Christians have had a problem imagining that Jesus would change water into an alcoholic beverage because of their strong opinion against drinking alcohol. It’s important to remember the facts: (A) The Bible never uses the word oinos to mean anything other than fermented grape juice. (B) The many vineyards in the holy land produced much grape juice, the majority of which had to be fermented. If it were not fermented, it would spoil due to lack of refrigeration. (C) It was the custom in Bible times to mix some water with the wine so that the wine that people drank at meals was relatively “weak” (low alcohol content). (D) Just because Jesus made wine for use at a wedding does not mean that he approved of its abuse. Intoxication has always been a sin.
关于希腊原文“酒”（oino）一字：有些基督徒难以想象耶稣会把水变为酒精饮料，因为他们坚决地反对饮酒。但是有几点需要知道： （A）圣经中提到oino是仅仅指发酵的葡萄汁，而不是其他的任何东西。（B）圣地的葡萄园生产大量的葡萄汁，它们都必须经过发酵保存。不然，葡萄汁都会因无法冷藏而变坏。（C）在圣经中所记载年代，人们经常用水兑在用以佐餐的酒中，使酒变得温和（降低酒精浓度）（D）耶稣在婚姻上变水为酒来饮用，并不代表他提倡酗酒。醉酒绝对是犯罪。
5. Wedding celebrations in the days of Jesus lasted for an entire week. This explains why Jesus turned such a large quantity of water into wine (estimates range from 60 to 180 gallons [four liters per gallon]!).
Do the words of verse 10 show that Jesus approved of drinking too much? Explain your answer.
在耶稣的时代婚姻通常要持续整整一周。这也是为什么耶稣将如此多的水变为酒（大概80到180加仑[一加仑约等于4升]!）.
从第十节能看出耶稣认同过量饮酒吗？请做解释。
6. Verse 11 contains John’s first use of the word sign. What does he say is the purpose and result of this sign?
约翰在第十一节中第一次提到神迹一词。约翰有没有说这个神迹的目的和结果是什么？
2:12-25 Jesus Clears the Temple 耶稣洁净圣殿
7. Compare verse 12 with Mark 2:1. What conclusion can we draw about Capernaum from these two verses? Who are Jesus’ “brothers”? (See Matthew 13:55.)
比较第十二节和马可福音2：1。我们能够得出关于迦百农的什么结论？谁是耶稣的弟兄们？（参太13：55）
8. Compare Passover regulations in Exodus 12:1-20 with Deut. 16:1-8. Are there any differences? How is the Passover celebration in Jesus’ day slightly different from the Old Testament regulations?
比较出埃及记12:1-20和申命记16:1-8中的逾越节的条例，两者有什么区别？耶稣时 代逾越节的庆祝跟旧约的规定有什么不同？
9. Which direction does Jesus travel in going from Capernaum to Jerusalem? Why is this described as “up”?
耶稣从迦百农到耶路撒冷是向那个方向而行？为什么这里用“上”？
10. The wrongness in what was going on in the temple can be seen in Mark 11:17, where Jesus clears the temple for a second time during Holy Week. What was the wrong thing that was going on in the service the sellers were offering the worshippers?
从马可福音11:17，我们可以看出为什么圣殿中所进行的买卖是错误的，这是耶稣在受难周中第二次洁净圣殿。商贩们买东西给来参加礼拜的人提供方便有什么不对的地方呢？
11. In what way does this incident paint a picture of Jesus that is quite different from how we usually think of him?
这件事使我们看到耶稣与我们通常所想象的有什么不同？
12. Use verse 17 to show that Psalm 69 is a Messianic Psalm. Find another verse in Psalm 69 that shows the same thing.
用17节表明诗篇69篇是弥赛亚的诗篇。找出诗篇69篇中意思相同的章节。
13. The Jews asked Jesus, What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this? What did Jesus say would be the “sign”? Can you think of something Jesus said that was similar to this, which was spoken at a different time in his ministry? (See Matthew 12.)
犹太人问耶稣，你能行什么神迹给我们来证明你的权柄呢？ 耶稣说的“神迹”是什么呢？你还记得耶稣在自己传道生涯中另外一处曾经说过的跟这个类似的话吗 ？（参太12）
14. What temple were the Jews talking about? How would these unbelievers twist these words at Jesus’ trial? (Matthew 26:61)
犹太人谈论的圣殿是指哪个圣殿？这些不信的人在耶稣被审判的时候又如何歪曲这些话？
15. How does verse 23 emphasize the purpose of John’s gospel?
23节如何强调约翰福音的宗旨？
16. How does John 20:30 help explain what else Jesus was doing during his stay in Jerusalem for the Passover?
通过约翰福音20:30 可以看出耶稣在逾越节期间在耶路撒冷还做了什么事？
17. Explain what Jesus did and what Jesus knew according to verses 24-25.
根据24-25节，解释耶稣做了什么以及他知道什么。
