Lesson 8 – Jesus Teaches at the Feast of Tabernacles
第八课—耶稣在在住棚节宴席上的教导
John 7 约翰福音第七章
Getting Started – In the previous chapter we noted how Jesus had been in Galilee for Passover (March-April). The Bread of Life discussion had taken place in the village of Capernaum in Galilee, which was now serving as Jesus’ ministry headquarters. John begins chapter 7 simply by saying, “After this.” He then describes Jesus’ activity until the time of the Feast of Tabernacles, which took place in September-October after the grape harvest. It commemorated how God guided his people through the wilderness and provided them with refreshment, a picture of the perfect spiritual refreshment that would come from the Messiah. At the time of this celebration, the resistance to Jesus as the Christ was building among the Jewish leadership. The following Passover (April-May) of the next year would mark the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
内容简介—在之前的一章里我们看到耶稣在加利利过逾越节(三至四月).关于生命的粮的教导是在加利利的迦百农村庄里发生的,也就是耶稣现在福音事工的大本营。约翰以简单的一句话“这事以后”作为第七章的开始。他接下来记述耶稣在住棚节之前的活动。住棚节在葡萄丰收之后的九到十月，它是为了纪念神带领他的百姓经过旷野并不断的更新他们，这也是预表弥赛亚带来的源源不断的属灵的更新。在这次庆祝活动时，犹太人的领袖们已经开始抵触耶稣是基督这一说法。翌年的复活节（四到五月之间）就是耶稣受难、死亡和复活的时候。

Jesus Teaches at the Feast 7:14-24
耶稣在节期的教导 7：14-24
[Note: verse 15 – The studying they were talking about would have been the schools for rabbis run by the Jerusalem leadership. They were actually saying, “He didn’t study with us and learn it our way.”]
[注：15节—他们所说的学是指上耶路撒冷领袖们为拉比们办的学。他们事实是在说“他没跟我们一起学习竟然也明白我们所学的。”]
6. It was common practice in Jesus’ day for the Bible scholars to quote the ideas of other rabbis. They expected Jesus to do the same. How was he different?

犹太领袖的不信 7：45-52
19. There would have been quite a difference in the spiritual training between the temple guards and the spiritual leaders (chief priests and Pharisees). How is the reaction of these two groups to Jesus just the opposite of what we might expect?
会堂的差役们和属灵领袖们（大祭司和法利赛人）所受的属灵的教育应该有很大的差异。 而这两种人对耶稣的反应如何跟我们所想像的正好相反？
