第十六课—成长、爱与恨
The Gospel According to John
约翰福音
Lesson 16 – Growth, Love, and Hate
第十六课——成长、爱与恨
John 15 约翰福音十五章
Getting Started – The closing words of chapter 14 (“Come now; let us leave.”) and the opening words of chapter 15 lead us to believe that Jesus and his disciples were now beginning their walk from the Upper Room to the Garden of Gethsemane. Most likely they are walking past vineyards, so Jesus uses the word picture of vines, branches, and grapes to illustrate important truths about the believer’s relationship with him and the Father. As the conversation turns toward love, Jesus must also address the opposite – the world’s hatred of him and his followers. In spite of that, the promised Spirit would keep his followers faithful.
内容简介 —— 第十四章的结尾（“起来，我们走吧！”） 和第十五章的开头使得我们相信耶稣和门徒此时已离开马可楼，走向客西马尼园。很可能正经过葡萄园，所以耶稣用葡萄树、枝子和葡萄讲解关于信徒和他与父之间的重要真理。当话题转向爱时，耶稣必须谈谈相反者——这世界对他和他追随者的憎恨。尽管如此，耶稣应许的圣灵将保守追随者们的信心。
Jesus the Vine and His Branches 15:1-17
葡萄树（耶稣）和他的枝子 15:1-17
Things to Note:
注意事项：
v. 1-17 Isaiah 5 made the vineyard picture a familiar one in describing the relationship between the God of Israel and his people. Christ and his followers become the “replacement vineyard” for the house of Israel which the prophet said would become a “wasteland.”
1-17节 关于以色列神和他的子民之间的关系，以赛亚书第5章描述了一幅相似的光景。基督和他的追随者成为以色列家葡萄园的“取代者”。以色列家的葡萄园曾被先知预言变成一片“荒原”。
v. 1 I am the true vine - The last of John’s “I am” statements; “true vine” may be in contrast to the vineyard of Isaiah 5 that produced only bad fruit.
第1节 我是真葡萄树——约翰福音最后一句“我是”的宣告；“真葡萄树”与以赛亚书第5章中只结坏果子的葡萄园形成对比。
v. 4 Mutual indwelling, here in “vine” language. See also 14:20. The verb “remain” shows a close relationship which Jesus desires with his followers.
第4节 在这里“葡萄树”语言中的彼此内住，同样见于约翰福音14：20。词语“在”说明耶稣渴望与其追随者的亲密关系。
v. 11 According to the teachings of the rabbis, perfect joy would only be found in the Messianic Kingdom. Jesus is therefore claiming to be the Messiah with these words.
第11节 根据拉比的教导，只有在弥赛亚王国里才有完全的喜乐。耶稣因此用这些话称自己是那位弥赛亚。
Questions to Consider:
思考以下问题：
1. The pruning of grapevines involved two things: 1) cutting off the dead branches, and 2) cutting back on the smaller branches so they would become larger and more fruitful. How is this a picture of how God interacts with his people?
修剪葡萄树包括两种情况： 1）剪断死去的，以及2）剪短枝子使它们长大结更多果子。从这幅画面我们看到神跟他的子民是怎样的互动关系？
2. Explain what Jesus means in verse 3.
解释一下耶稣在第3节经文中所讲的意思。
3. Explain the picture language of verses 4-5 using clear biblical teachings from other parts of the Bible.
请使用圣经其他部分的清晰教导来解释第4-5节经文的描述性的语言。
4. In verse 7 Jesus makes a promise concerning the prayers of his followers. How does verse 8 affect the way his followers use that promise?
第７节经文耶稣对他追随者的祷告做出应许。第８节经文如何影响他的追随者使用此应许的方式？
5. In verses 9-17 Jesus uses the word agape for “love.” (Agape is the love God has for us and which we are to have for God and others.) Make a list of the characteristics of agape that you find in these verses.
在第9-17 节经文中耶稣使用词语 agape 来表示“爱”（Agape 是神对我们的爱也是我们应该对神和众人的爱）。将你在这些经文中找到的关于agape的特征列出来。
6. In verse 11 Jesus speaks of “joy.” Consider what Jesus is about to go through, and explain how his understanding of “joy” is quite different than ours often is.
在第 11节经文中耶稣说到“喜乐”。考虑到耶稣即将遭遇的，请解释他对“喜乐”的理解何以与我们的理解完全不同。
7. Why is it important for us to see ourselves as “friends of Jesus” rather than just “servants of God”?
为什么看我们是“耶稣的朋友”比看是“神的仆人”重要？
8. When is it important to remember the truths of verse 16?
在什么时候应该想起第16节经文？
Tolerating the World’s Hatred 15:18-27
容忍世界的憎恨15:18-27
Things to Note: 注意事项：
vv. 18-19 The Roman Emperor Domitian would claim at the end of the 1st century AD that the term “lord” could only applied to the emperor himself, thus making those who called Jesus “Lord” enemies of the state. That would be one example of how the world hates Christ.
第18-19节 罗马皇帝图密善在公元后１世纪末宣布“主”这个词只能用于皇帝他本人，因此，使那称耶稣为“主”的人成为国家的敌人。它是这个世界怎样憎恨基督的一个例子。
Questions to Consider:
思考以下问题：
9. Explain what Jesus means in verse 22-25 when he says, “They would not be guilty of sin.”
请解释当耶稣在第22-25节经文中说：“他们就没有罪”时的意思 。
10. In these verses Jesus uses the word “Para’claytos” to refer to the Holy Spirit. The meaning of that word is “to call to one’s side.” Why is that such a good description of the Spirit’s work?
在这些经文中耶稣用“保惠师”这个词语来指圣灵。这个词的含义是“叫到身边来”。为什么它很好地描述了圣灵的作工呢？
11. Jesus says concerning the work of the Holy Spirit, he will testify about me. Why is that description of the Spirit’s work important to remember in today’s church?
关于圣灵的作工，耶稣说，他将为我做作见证。为什么在今天的教会中记住圣灵作工的这种描述是重要的呢？
12. How do verses 26-27 give shape and direction to your ministry?
第 26-27节经文 给你的侍奉以怎样的帮助与指引？
