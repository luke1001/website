第十五课—使人得安慰的应许
The Gospel According to John
约翰福音
Lesson 15 – Comforting Promises
第15课——使人得安慰的应许
John 14 约翰福音十四章
Getting Started – Departure and denial were the themes Jesus had just addressed. The disciples are surely upset. There’s tension in the Upper Room as Jesus’ farewell address continues. He’ll prepare a heavenly home for them; he’s the way to the Father, he’s the key to prayer; he’ll send his Spirit; he leaves them with peace. The Savior’s words still work calmness and confidence.
内容简介 —— 分离与背弃是耶稣刚讲到的主题。门徒们显然有点失落。马可楼因耶稣所说的告别之话而紧张起来。耶稣将为他们预备天家；他是通往天父的道路，是祷告的中保；他将差派圣灵；赐平安给门徒们。救赎主的话语依然产生安稳和信心。
Jesus Comforts and Encourages His Disciples 14:1 – 14
耶稣安慰和鼓励他的门徒14:1 – 14
Things to Note:
注意事项：
v. 6 – References to the “Way” would have been familiar to both Old Testament believers as well as believers in the early New Testament church. See Isaiah 35:8; Acts 9:2; Acts 19:9.
第6节 关于“道路”的信息，对于旧约信徒和早期新约教会信徒来说都不是陌生的。见以赛亚书35:8，使徒行传9:2，使徒行传19:9。
v. 8 - Philip apparently wants Jesus to arrange some kind of personal appearance by God the Father.
第8节 腓力显然想让耶稣安排让天父以某个人的形象显现出来。
Questions to Consider:
思考以下问题：
1. Give a summary of the doctrines found in John 14:1-4.
请概括约翰福音14:1-4中的教义。
2. Give specific examples of how you would use John 14:1-4 in ministry.
你怎样在侍奉中运用约翰福音14:1-4，请举几个详细的例子。
3. References to “the Way” are given in the note on verse 6 above. List passages in earlier chapters of John where Jesus speaks of “truth” and “life” in reference to himself.
关于“道路”，前面第6节经文注解给出了参考信息，请在约翰福音14章之前的经文里将耶稣关于自己所讲到“真理”和“生命”的段落列出。
4. Summarize the content of John 14:6 without using the words “way,” “truth,” or “life.”
使用“道路”、“真理”或“生命”词语以外的其他表达概括约翰福音 14:6的内容。
5. In verses 9-14 Jesus speaks of his oneness with the Father, and what his miracles show. Look for passages in earlier chapters of John that deal with these two themes.
在第9至14节经文里耶稣提到他与父的为一，以及他的神迹显明什么。关于这两个主题请查看约翰福音前几章的经文。
Oneness with the Father –
与父的合一——
What Jesus’ miracles show –
耶稣的神迹显明什么——
6. How would believers do “greater things” than Jesus’ miracles after Jesus’ ascension? (See Rom. 10:14-17 1 Cor. 12:3 2 Cor. 5:17 Gal. 3:26-29.)
信徒们如何在耶稣升天之后做“更大的事”？（见罗马书10:14-17、哥林多前书12:3、哥林多后书5:17、加拉太书3:26-29。）
7. What two things does Jesus want us to remember about prayer according to verses 13-14?
根据13-14经文，关于祷告耶稣想让我们记住哪两件事？
Jesus Promises to Send His Spirit 14:15 – 31
耶稣应许差派圣灵14:15 – 31
Things to Note:
注意事项：
v. 22 – This Judas is the apostle with another name – Thaddaeus. His question seems to show that the disciples were still looking for an earthly kingdom from the Christ.
第22节 这位犹大有另外一个名字——达太。他的提问说明门徒们依然在从基督那儿寻求世上的国。
v. 23 – The Greek literally says, “If anyone loves me, he will guard my word.” (Compare John 1:1.)
第23节 这句希腊语原义是说：“人若爱我，他将恪守我的道。”（对比约翰福音1:1。）
Questions to Consider:
思考以下问题：
8. The Greek word for “Counselor” in verses 16 and 26 comes from a verb that means “to call to one’s side.” Why is that a good description of the Holy Spirit’s work?
在第１６节和第２６节经文中的希腊词语“保惠师”源于一个含义 “叫到身边来”的动词。为什么它很好地描述了圣灵的作工呢？
9. State in your own words what Jesus is promising about the Holy Spirit’s work in verses 16 and 26.
用你自己的话说说在１６节和２６节经文中的圣灵作工，耶稣应许了什么？
10. How does the promise of verse 26 apply differently to us than it did to the apostles?
第26节经文中的应许适用于我们和适用于当时的使徒有何不同？
11. From these verses (15 – 31) make a list of the blessings that belong to us believers because Christ and his Spirit live in us.
因为基督和圣灵住在我们里面，请从这些经文（15-31）中列出一个属于我们信徒的祝福的清单。
12. In what sense does Jesus mean “the Father is greater than I” (v. 28), when he had previously said, “I and the Father are one”? (Jn. 10:30) [This phrase, “the Father is greater than I,” must be understood in the context of all of verse 28. Phil. 2:5-11 sheds light on this subject as well.]
在什么意义上耶稣说“父是比我大的”（28节经文），因为他之前说过：“我与父原为一”（约翰福音10:30） [这句话“父是比我大的”，要在第28节全部经文内容中领会其含义。腓立比书2:5-11也解释了该主题。]
13. Which passages in this chapter would you find especially useful in comforting troubled believers?
你会看到本章中的哪些段落特别有助于安慰不安的信徒们？
