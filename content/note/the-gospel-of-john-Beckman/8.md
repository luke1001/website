John 8 约翰福音第八章
Getting Started A careful study of the beginning of chapter 8 seems to indicate that 8:12 follows immediately after 7:52. 7:53 – 8:11 most likely happened at a different time and was probably inserted by an editor later. There is no reason to doubt that it really happened the way John describes the event, and there’s no reason to say that it is not God’s Word. However, even if this section was not part of John’s original text, all the truths it contains are taught elsewhere in Scripture. We continue to use it as part of the inspired text.
内容简介 经过对第八章开始的仔细推敲会发现8:12节紧承7:52节。7：53-8：11节记载的事发生在其他时候，可能为后来的编者所加。我们没有理由怀疑事实正如约翰所记述的那样，也没有理由怀疑这是神的话。尽管这一部分并不是约翰原稿中的一部分，然而它所教导的真理圣经其他地方亦有教导。我们还是把它看做所默示的经文的一部分。

16. Explain verse 56.
解释56节。
17. The Greek text of Jesus’ words I am in verse 58 are exactly the same as the Greek translation of Exodus 3:14, where the LORD refers to himself as I AM. (The Jews in Jesus’ day were familiar with the Greek translation of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint.) In verses 24 and 28 of this chapter, Jesus had used those same words (I am), which are translated as “the one I claim to be” in the NIV English Bible. By using these words about himself, what is Jesus claiming? Why did this bring such a violent reaction from his Jewish enemies?
58节中希腊文耶稣说的“我是”跟出埃及记3：14节中神指着自己说的“我是”的希腊文翻译完全一样。（耶稣时代的犹太人熟悉旧约的希腊文翻译，称为七十士译本。）在本章24节和28节中，耶稣用到同样的词（我是），在新国际版本中翻译为“我所称的那位”。耶稣这样称自己是为了表明什么？为什么这在他的仇敌犹太人中间引起强烈反感。
18. Why did the Jews react so violently in verse 59? (See Leviticus 24:14.)
为什么犹太人在59节中反映如此激烈？
19. Give a summary of the powerful messages you find in this chapter.
