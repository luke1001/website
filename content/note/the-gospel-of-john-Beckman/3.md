Lesson 4 – Conversation with Nicodemus / Testimony About Jesus
第四课—与尼哥底母的对话/耶稣的见证
John 3 约翰福音 三章
Getting Started: In chapter 2 the focus was on “signs.” Jesus performed his first “sign,” and his disciples put their trust in him. Jesus went to Jerusalem for Passover and cleared the temple of dishonest sellers from the temple, and the Jews asked for a “sign” that he had the right to do that. John tells us that Jesus performed many other “signs” as well, with the result that many people believed in his name. While in Jerusalem, Jesus has a conversation with Nicodemus, and the subject of “signs” comes up again. In this conversation Jesus shows us the way to eternal life.
内容简介：第二章的中心是“神迹”。耶稣施行第一次神迹，然后他的门徒开始相信他。耶稣在逾越节在耶路撒冷的圣殿洁净圣殿把诡诈的商贩赶出去，犹太人要耶稣显“神迹”证明他有权力做这样的事。约翰告诉我们耶稣还行了其它好多“神迹”，使很多人因此信了他的名。在耶路撒冷，耶稣跟尼哥底母谈论关于将要来的“神迹。在这段谈话中耶稣向我们显明通往永生之路。
