#### B. Translation 翻译

1) Understand this: in the last days there will be terrible times. 2) For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant (proud), blasphemers (those who speak abusive evil), disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy (wicked), 3) without natural affection (hard-hearted), unforgiving, slanderers, without self control, savage (brutal), hostile to virtue (the good), 4) treacherous (traitors), reckless (literally, ‘those who fall forward’), consumed with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5) having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Turn away from such people.
 
6) For out of these people are those who sneak into homes and take captive weak-willed (foolish) women, who are loaded down with sins, swayed by all kinds of evil desires, 7) always learning and never able to attain an understanding of the truth. 8) Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these people oppose the truth, people who are corrupt (ruined) in mind and failing the test in regard to the faith. 9) But they will not get very far because their lack of sense will be evident to all, as the lack of sense of these became.
 
10) But you followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience (long suffering), my love, my endurance, 11) my persecutions, my sufferings, what things happened to me at Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra; what kind of persecutions I experienced. Yet from them the Lord rescued me.
 
12) All those who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 13) But evil people and imposters (false teachers who use spells) will go from bad to worse (become worse), deceiving and being deceived. 14) You, however, continue in these things which you have learned and of which you have been convinced, knowing from whom you learned them. 15) From infancy you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. 16) Every scripture passage is inspired by God (literally “divinely breathed”) and is useful for teaching, for rebuke (refutation), for correction (restoration to a proper position), for instruction in righteousness, 17) in order that the person of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About 知识点与思考 

1. In verse 1, Paul announces that there will be specially difficult times in the “last days.” The “last days” are the time between the 1st and 2nd Comings of Jesus. See Hebrews 1:1-2, 1 John 2:18). 

    第一节； 保罗告诉我们在“末世”会有极度苦难的时期。在此，“末世”指的是耶稣第一次来临之后到第二次来临之前的这段时期。（参考希伯来书１：１－２与 约翰一书 ２：１８。）

2. In verses 2-5, Paul uses 19 words or phrases to describe the wicked people of the last days. These evil, unbelieving people are lovers of themselves and their money and pleasure, but they are unloving toward God and other people. They are arrogant, disrespectful, thankless, brutal, deceiving, dangerous and hypocritical in their dealings with God and people. 

    第２－５小节，保罗用１９个词来描述末世人的罪恶。这些不信神的罪人爱的是自己，钱财和享乐，他们不敬神，不爱神的子民。这是一群傲慢，不敬，不知感恩，残暴，诡诈，凶险的人。有着敬虔的虚伪外貌，内心却不敬畏神。

3. In verses 6-7, Paul exposes the dishonest missionary methods these ungodly teachers employ to take unfair advantage of spiritually unstable and foolish people. 

    第6-7小节: 保罗揭露了某些邪恶教师的恶行,他们使用不当的传教方式,欺骗利用那些在属灵上不坚定,愚昧无知的人.

4. In verses 8-9, Paul compares these ungodly teachers to two ungodly men (probably Egyptian court magicians) who opposed Moses at the time of the Exodus. Paul declares that their sinful folly will be exposed and will not accomplish much. 

    第8-9小节: 保罗将这些不敬虔神的教师比做那两个在出埃及时期对抗摩西的人(可能是埃及的术士).这些人罪恶愚蠢的行为终有一日会被曝光而前功尽弃.

5. In verses 10-11, Paul affirms that Timothy had been very familiar with and deeply interested in Paul’s life and ministry from the time they met on a missionary journey in Galatia 15 years before. 

    第10-11小节: 保罗肯定提摩太对他一生的了解.他们15年前在加拉太的传教途中相识, 提摩太十分了解保罗的经历,并对保罗的传教生涯有着极大的关心与热忱.

6. In verse 12, Paul states that all sincere Christians can expect persecution. 

    第12小节: 保罗告诉我们所有敬虔的基督徒都会遭受逼迫。

7. In verse 13, Paul points out that the evil people of the last days will get worse and while attempting to deceive others will themselves be deluded. 

    第13小节: 保罗指出在末世那些罪恶的人会更加堕落,他们在诱骗他人的同时自己也被诱惑.

8. In verses 14-15, Paul urges Timothy to be faithful to the teachings of the holy scriptures which he has known since infancy and which give the wisdom of salvation through faith in Christ. 

    第14-15小节: 保罗知道提摩太幼年便熟知圣经, 他勉励提摩太继续坚守圣经的教训.并且通过在基督里的信心，使他得到得救的智慧.

9. In verses 16-17, Paul reveals that every passage of the Bible is given by God and is to be used to teach, rebuke, correct and instruct in righteousness so God’s people can be prepared for their faith and life. 

    第16-17小节: 保罗启示我们圣经的每段经文都是从神而来, 是神赐给我们用来教训，督责，使人归正，教导人学义的.神的信徒倚靠圣经来预备自己的信仰和人生.

 
#### D. Points To Discuss And Apply 讨论重点与应用 

1. According to God’s teaching in the Bible, we are living in “the last times.” How does this knowledge help Christians as they live their lives on earth? 

    按照神在圣经中的教导,我们生活在”末世”. 明白了这一点后,我们基督徒该如何过这属世的日子?

2. In your opinion why did God give us so many (19) identifying character traits of the wicked people of the last times? (see verses 2-5) 

    在第2-5小节中,神通过保罗列举了末世邪恶之人具有的种种特征.神为何要罗列出这些罪人的特征达19个之多?


3. How do we reconcile God’s warning to “turn away from” wicked people in verse 5 with His desire to have “all people to be saved” and His commission to “go and make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19)? 

    在第五小节，神警告我们对那些“有敬虔的外貌，却背了敬虔的实意“的人，“这等人你要躲开”。但在圣经的其他地方，神又希望所有人都能得到救恩。比如在马太福音２８：１９，神给基督徒的使命是“你们要去，使万民作我的门徒”。我们如何理解这两个看似矛盾的戒命，并在我们的服侍与传道过程中找到一个平衡点？


4. In the fight against false teaching: a. What things does God obligate Himself to do? b. What things are the followers of God’s Word obligated to do? 

    对于那些有悖圣经的错误教导，我们要积极与之抗争。在这场属灵的征战中，神与他的使徒都要积极的战斗。请列举神做的工与我们基督徒应该做的工.


5. How valuable is God’s gift of providing strong, faithful Christians to serve as good examples and teachers for other believers? 

    神预备了很多坚定忠诚的基督徒在我们身边。他们给我们树立了好的榜样，他们对圣经的理解让我们受益匪浅。请列举他们对于我们个人的信心与整个教会有那些帮助。


6. Offer several reasons why God allows and arranges for His dearly loved children in Christ to be persecuted in some way for their faith. 

    神爱我们这些属基督的子女,但是有时我们会经历试炼, 有时甚至会因我们的信仰而遭受逼迫,神为何会允许这些不好的事降临到我们身上? 请列举理由.


7. Why is it important for God’s people to believe and vigorously defend the teaching that everything in the Bible is the true Word of God? 

    圣经中的一切教导都是来自神的真道,这是作为基督徒的基本信念. 请解释为何基督徒不但要接受而且要积极捍卫这个信念.

8. Drawing on 2 Timothy 3:15-17 and other parts of God’s Word, develop a list of reasons for which God has given us the Bible. 
    参考15-17小节以及其他经文,举出几个原因为何神要为我们预备圣经.
