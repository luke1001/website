#### B. Translation 翻译 

1) I charge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom. 2) Proclaim the Word, be present in favorable (opportune) times and in unfavorable (inopportune) times, refute, rebuke (bring charges of wrongdoing against), encourage with all patience and thorough instruction. 3) For the time (period) will comes when people will not put up with (tolerate) sound doctrine, but instead in accord with their own desires, they heap up (accumulate) more <teachers>who will teach them what they are eager (itching) to hear. 4) They will turn their hearing away from the truth and they will also turn aside to myths (fables, fictions). 5) But you, be self-controlled (use good judgment) in all situations, bear hardship patiently, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry completely.</teachers>

6) For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 7) I have fought the good fight; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith. 8) For in the future, there is safely stored away for me the wreath of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will present to (award to) me on that Day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved His appearing.

9) Do your best to come to me quickly. 10) For Demas has deserted me because he loved this present world, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia. 11) Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you because he is useful for the ministry. 12) I sent Tychicos to Ephesus. 13) When you come, bring the cloak which I left in Troas with Karpos, also the books (scrolls), especially the parchments. 14) Alexander, the metal worker (coppersmith) did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 15) You, also, be on your guard against him because he strongly opposed our message (words).

16) At my first defense, no one was at my side, but everyone deserted me. May it not be charged against them. 17) But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. I was also saved from the mouth of the lion. 18) The Lord will rescue me from every wicked (evil) action and will safely bring me to His heavenly kingdom.

19) Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. 20) Erastus stayed in Corinth. I left Trophimus behind, sick in Miletus. 21) Do your best (hurry) to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linos, Claudia, and all the brothers. 22) The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
