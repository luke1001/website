#### B. Translation　经文

1) You then, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2) The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful people, who will be qualified to teach others. 3) Suffer hardship with us as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4) No one who is actively serving in the military entangles himself in the activities of civilian life because he wants to please the officer who enlisted him (his commanding officer). 5) In another way, if someone participates as an athlete, he does not receive the winner’s wreath unless he competes according to the rules. 6) It is proper (fitting) for the hard working farmer to be the first one to receive a share of the crop. 7) Consider what I am saying. The Lord will give you understanding in these matters.

8) Keep remembering Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, out of the seed of David, according to my gospel, 9) for which I suffer bad things, even to the point of being chained (in bonds) as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound. 10) Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect in order that they may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with great glory. 11) Faithful is the saying:If we die with Him, we will also live with Him.12) If we endure with Him, we will also rule with Him. If we deny Him, He, on His part, will deny us. 13)If we are unfaithful, He, on His part, will remain faithful Because He is not able to deny Himself.

14) Keep reminding them of these things, charging them in the presence of the Lord, not to fight about words. It is not at all useful, and it is ruinous to those who hear. 15) Do your best to present yourself to God as genuine, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, who correctly handles the word of truth. 16) Avoid unholy, empty talks because those who indulge in it will increase in ungodliness. 17) Their word is like spreading gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18) who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they overturn the faith of some. 19) Nevertheless, the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and “Let everyone who confesses the name of the Lord stand apart from unrighteousness.”

20) In a large house there are items not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some for noble purposes and some for lowly (shameful) purposes. 21) If anyone cleanses himself from these dishonorable purposes, he will be an item for honorable, sanctified (holy) , very useful to the master, prepared for every good use. 22) Flee the desires of youth, pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 23) Reject those foolish and ignorant inquiries (searchings) because you know they produce quarrels (fights). 24) It is not proper for the servant of the Lord to quarrel. Rather he must be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, 25) teaching with gentleness those who oppose him in the hope that God will grant them repentance that leads to a knowledge of the truth, 26) and that they will come to their senses, out of the trap of the devil, by whom they had been taken captive to do His will.

    第11-13小节: 保罗给了我们一个鼓舞人心的承诺: 凡与基督一同承受苦难仍信靠他的,必和他一同作王.保罗同时给出一个警告,　那些拒绝否认基督的,基督也将不认他们.为神做工既荣耀又危险.

    第23-26小节: 保罗嘱咐神的仆人避开纷争,以爱心和耐心将神的话教导给人,使他们得以悔改,明白真道,逃离撒旦的掌控。
