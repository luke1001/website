#### B. Translation　翻译

1) Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God in accord with the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus. 2) To Timothy, my dearly loved child. Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus, our Lord. 3) I am grateful to God, whom I serve as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as I have continuing remembrance of you in my prayers night and day. 4) Remembering your tears, I long to see you in order that I may be filled with joy. 5) I have received a reminder of the genuine faith that is in you, which first lived in your grandmother, Lois, and in your mother, Eunice, and which, I am convinced, is also in you. 6) For this reason I remind you to make active use of (rekindle) the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7) Because God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love and self-disciple (good judgment in action). 8) Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner, but join me in suffering for the gospel with (by) the power of God, 9) who has saved us and called us with a holy life calling – not because of our works, but because of His own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time (times everlasting). 10) But now it has been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and also has brought light to life and immortality (incorruptibility) through the gospel. 11) Of this I was appointed (made) a herald, an apostle and a teacher. 12) For this reason I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know by personal intimate experience whom I have believed and am convinced that He is powerful (able) to guard which I have entrusted until that Day. 13) Keep as the model (pattern) of sound teaching what you have heard from me with faith and love in Christ Jesus. 14) Guard the good thing entrusted through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 15) You know that everyone in Asia has deserted (turned away from) me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16) May the Lord grant mercy to the household on Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisoning chains. 17) On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched diligently for me until he found me. 18) May the Lord grant that he find mercy from the Lord on that Day. How many ways he served in Ephesus, you know very well.

#### C. Things To Learn And Think About　知识点与思考

1. In verse 1, Paul tells us important things about his call to be an apostle. First of all, Paul is ‘an apostle of Christ.’ He belongs to Jesus Christ and represents Him. Paul also serves ‘through the will of God.’ Paul serves by God’s desire and decision, not by his own or by anyone else’s. Finally, Paul serves ‘in accord with the promise of life in Christ.’ Paul proclaims the precious message of eternal life that God promises in Christ. 

    第一小节： 保罗告诉我们他受神呼召成为使徒。首先，他是’基督的使徒’，他从属于基督并代表基督。其次，保罗“奉神旨意”伺奉。他遵照神的意愿与决定，而不是他个人或他人的意志。最后保罗照着在基督耶稣里生命的应许伺奉。他宣告来自神的宝贵讯息，那就是在基督里能得永生. 

2. In verse 2, Paul emphasizes God’s wonderful love for sinful people. He tells us that God gives us His grace (His freely given love for those who deserve only punishment), His mercy (His love for the needy and helpless) and His peace (His restoring of wholeness and harmony to our sin-ruined lives). 

    第二小节：保罗强调神对罪人的奇妙大爱。他告诉我们神给我们的恩典（神不要回报的去爱只配得惩罚的罪人），怜悯（神爱贫穷无助的人）， 与平安（他将健全和谐重新带回我们被罪破坏的支离破碎的生活。）。 
    
3. In verses 3-5, Paul reveals his warm personal regard for his co-worker, Timothy. Paul considers Timothy his ‘dear son.” He thanks God for Timothy, takes joy in his faith, prays for him, thinks about him often and longs to see him again.

6. In verse 8, Paul calls his partner in the ministry of the Gospel to set aside an fear or shame he maybe tempted to feel in his service to Christ and to willingly and courageously accept hardship for the cause of Christ. 

    第八小节: 保罗号召他的同工抛开一切在服事过程中感受到的疑惧与羞愧,并将这些负面的情绪扭换为志愿勇敢的接受为神的事业承受艰难困苦. 

7. In verses. 9-10, Paul affirms precious truths about our salvation. a) He tells us that salvation is God’s free gift of grace, not something we earn by our works. b) He tells us that God’s saving grace was already granted in eternity. c) He tells us that salvation is based on the death-destroying, life-giving work of Jesus Christ. d) He tells us that by saving us, God also calls us to live a holy life. 

    第9-10小节: 保罗声明关于我们得救的宝贵事实. a)他告诉我们救恩是神给我们无偿的恩典, 这得救的恩典不是靠我们自己做工能赚得的.b)他告诉我们这救恩是我们已得着的永恒的恩典.c)他告诉我们这救恩是藉着基督耶稣所做的废死赐生的工. d)他告诉我们神不但要拯救我们,还要呼召我们活出圣洁的生命. 

8. In verses 11-12a, Paul shares his duties as a servant of God’s Word. He is one who announces it (herald), one who faithfully witnesses to it (apostle), one who teaches it, and one who suffers for it. 

    第11-12小节: 保罗让我们一同为神的话语做仆人.保罗为神的话语做仆人,他宣告神的话语(作传道的), 他做忠实的见证(作使徒), 他教导神的话语(作师傅),并为此受难. 

9. In verse 12b, Paul explains that he is willing to suffer for the gospel and not be ashamed of it because he knows this precious message personally and intimately and is sure that God will fulfill His promises to deliver him safely to heaven on Judgment Day.
