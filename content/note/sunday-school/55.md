### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

On one day, Jesus called John the Disciple, Andrew, and Simon Peter to be his disciples. On the next day, Jesus called Nathanael and Phillip to become disciples. On the third day Jesus took them all to a wedding in Cana. Jesus’ earthly ministry had begun. His time on earth was almost over. But His time to die to save us, had not yet come. He had many other things to do first..

一天耶稣呼召门徒约翰，安得烈和西门彼得为他的门徒。第二天耶稣呼召拿但业和腓力为他的门徒。第三天耶稣将他们带去在迦南的一个婚宴。耶稣在地上的事工开始了。他在地上的时间快结束了。但是他为了救我们而被钉死的时间还没有到。他要先做许多其他的事。

We heard last week that Jesus celebrated the Passover at age 12, and found an audience for His message in that Temple. After visiting His family for a few days, He again attends the Passover celebration. His work had now begun. He teaches and performs miracles in Jerusalem.

上周我们听到耶稣在他12岁的时候庆祝逾越节，就在圣殿向人讲道。在与家人呆了几天后，他又来参加逾越节庆典。现在他开始了工作。他在耶路撒冷教导人并施行神迹。

Jesus showed His ownership of His Temple. Remember that God had set up this place of worship during the days when the Jewish people were wandering in the desert. God also told His people how He wanted them to remember this time in their lives with a Passover celebration. He wanted them to worship Him in this Temple.

耶稣表明了圣殿是他的殿。记得早在犹太人在旷野行走时神就设立了这个敬拜的地方。神也告诉他的百姓他要他们用逾越节来记住他们生命中的那个时刻。他要他们在这个圣殿敬拜他。

Most of all, He wanted all people to know that He was the Lamb of God come to save them and take them to heaven. Listen to the words in John that tell us how He wanted them to believe in Him.

最重要的，他要所有的民众知道他是神的羔羊，为要拯救他们，带领他们进入天堂。聆听约翰福音中告诉我们他是如何要他们相信他的话语。
