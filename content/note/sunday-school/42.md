##### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

Paul and Barnabas were traveling around the Mediterranean Sea, in countries where many Gentiles lived. When they returned to Jerusalem, they met with the apostles and leaders of the Christians. Peter had a message for the new believers in Jesus. “We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they (the Gentiles) are. “ Acts 15:11.

保罗和巴拿巴围绕地中海，在许多外邦人居住的地方周游宣教。当他们回到耶路撒冷时，他们与使徒和基督徒领袖相聚。彼得有个信息给相信耶稣的新信徒。“我 们 得 救 乃 是 因 主 耶 稣 的 恩 ， 和 他 们 一 样 ， 这 是 我 们 所 信 的 。”使徒行传15:11。

Paul was called by God to minister to the Gentiles. Gentiles were all the people who were not of the Jewish nation, God’s chosen people to bring our Savior into the world. But God intended to save all people, not just the Jewish nation. A great ministry is opening up in all the world to tell everyone about Jesus as we hear about Paul’s life.

保罗被神呼召向外邦人传福音事工。救主出自神的选民，犹太民族，外邦人就是所有非犹太民族的人民。但神要拯救所有人，不只是犹太民族。当我们听到保罗的生平事迹时，一个伟大的事工正在全世界开展，要告诉所有人关于耶稣。

    神仍然在全世界执行他的救恩计划。他要求你帮助。人们仍然问这个问题：“。。。 我 当 怎 样 行 才 可 以 得 救 ？。。。： 当 信 主 耶 稣 ， 你 和 你 一 家 都 必 得 救 。” 使徒行传16:30-31

    你怎样能像保罗一样传播耶稣的福音？（告诉别人耶稣，为那些正在做向别人传播福音工作的人祷告，为不信的人相信耶稣祷告，奉献钱支持那些正在传播福音的人。）

**PRAYER:** Dear Jesus. Thank You for giving me trust in Your Words and promises. Thank You for giving me a faith that believes in You. Thank You for saving me for heaven. Help me to tell many people about Your death and resurrection and the Home you have for us in Heaven. I love you, Jesus. Amen.

##### ENGLISH, PLEASE. 英语对话

Betty: Sometimes I wish I were a prophet!! Tom, do you think it would be fun to know what is going to happen in the future?

贝蒂：有时候我希望我是个先知！汤姆，你觉得能知道未来发生什么是不是很有趣？

Tom: No, Betty, I like to be surprised. Especially if something I did not like was about to happen. Would you like to know if you were going to get a bad grade in English, or if you were going to lose your purse before it happens?

汤姆：不。贝蒂，我喜欢惊喜。尤其是不想知道要发生我不喜欢的事。你愿意在事发之前就知道你的英语成绩将会很糟糕，或者将丢失钱包吗？

Betty: Well, maybe it would be very stressful! God DID use prophets to tell the good news about Jesus coming to save everyone before Jesus was born.

贝蒂：嗯，也许会很有压力！神的确在耶稣出生之前使用先知讲述关于耶稣到来拯救所有人的好消息。

Tom : Prophets told future events, but also told about God’s love and Jesus death to save us after it happened. Prophets are also teachers, like Paul.

汤姆：先知预告未来事件，但他们在耶稣为了拯救我们舍命这件事发生之后也继续传讲神的爱和这件事。先知也是老师，像保罗一样。

Betty: Prophets warned people about what would happen if people did not believe in Jesus.

贝蒂：先知警告人如果他们不相信耶稣将发生的事。

Tom: Yes, maybe it is good to know the future! And maybe if I knew I was going to get a bad mark in English, I would study harder.
