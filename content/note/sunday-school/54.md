### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US. 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

This is what Jesus did after His baptism. Mark 1:12-13 says, “At once the Spirit sent Him out into the desert, and He was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended Him.” Matthew tells us that Jesus fasted all those days. Fasting means that Jesus did not eat. Why did Jesus stop eating? He was preparing Himself for his ministry of preaching and teaching, dying and living as a human person. He prayed to His Father. The devil was happy for this opportunity to tempt Jesus to give up His mission to save us. Jesus shows us how to stop the devil, with Words of God. Jesus did not allow the devil to lead Him to sin.

这是耶稣受洗后做的事情。马可福音1:12-13说，圣灵就把耶稣催到旷野里去。他在旷野四十天，受撒但的试探，并与野兽同在一处，且有天使来伺候他。”马太告诉我们耶稣那些天禁食。禁食的意思是耶稣不吃饭。为什么耶稣不吃饭呢？他预备自己讲道，教导的事工，预备作为人要面临的生与死。他向天父祷告。魔鬼很高兴有这个机会诱惑耶稣放弃拯救我们的使命。耶稣让我们看到他怎样用神的话语制止魔鬼。耶稣不让魔鬼引诱他犯罪。

The second part of our lesson was written in John 1:19-51\. John the Baptist and John The Disciple were two different people. John The Disciple wrote the Gospel of John. A disciple is a follower of a teacher.

我们本课的第二部分在约翰福音1:19-51。施洗约翰和门徒约翰是不同的两个人。门徒约翰撰写了约翰福音。门徒就是跟随老师的人。

Elijah was a bold prophet in the Old Testament. He showed many that God was the Almighty ruler of the world. He was taken to heaven in a chariot.

以利亚是旧约中勇敢的先知。他大量证明神是这个世界的全能的统治者。他在战车中被主接到天国。
