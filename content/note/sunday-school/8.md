God promised a Savior to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and to David.

God promised a Savior to Mary and her cousin Elizabeth.

God promised a Savior (Jesus) to us and to all people so we would not die eternally because of our sin.

God kept His promise. He sent His Son Jesus to be born in a stable.

God was pleased with Jesus, His Son. He showed us that Jesus is God with the Father and Holy Spirit.

Jesus served God’s people by teaching them about God. He gave them faith to believe in Him as he healed people and raised them from the dead.

We are in the Kingdom of God when the Holy Spirit gives us faith to believe in Him. Zaccheus and the children received this love from Jesus, also.

耶稣藉着教导人们有关神的事情而服事人们。当他治好人的病，将他们从死里救活时，他赐给人们信心去相信他。
