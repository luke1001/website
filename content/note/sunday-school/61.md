##### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

Jesus our Savior is a loving, powerful, forgiving, truthful and sinless. Our faith in Him is protected by Him. Our faith in God gives us peace on earth and life forever in heaven.

我们的救主耶稣是慈爱的，大能的，饶恕人的，信实的，无罪的。他保守我们在他里面的信心。我们对神的信心给我们世上的平安和在天国的永生。

There is an evil force working against our God, and against all who believe in Him. He is called Satan, the Devil, the Evil One, and the Enemy of God. He is the opposite of our Savior Jesus. He will spend eternity in hell and he would like all of us to be there with him. He is hateful, unforgiving, the father of lies- the enemy of all that is true, just, and innocent. He has an army of demons that work for him, and against God.

有一种邪恶的力量反抗神，反抗所有相信神的人。他被称为撒旦，魔鬼，恶者和神的仇敌。他反对我们的救主耶稣。他将永远呆在地狱。他想要我们所有人和他在一起。他充满仇恨，不肯饶恕，是谎言之父。他与所有真实，公正和无罪为敌。他有魔鬼的宾团为他效力，反抗神。

It is important to remember that Jesus is more powerful than the devil. 1 John 38b says, The reason the Son of God (Jesus) appeared was to destroy the work of the devil. And in John 14:30 Jesus says, The prince ofthis world is coming. He has no hold on Me. In our lesson today, Jesus shows us that He is more powerful than the devil, and the demons knowit.

重要的是要记住耶稣比魔鬼更有能力。约翰一书38节说 神 的 儿 子 显 现 出来 ， 为 要 除 灭 魔 鬼 的 作 为 。约翰福音14:30中 耶稣说  这 世 界的 王 将 到 。 他 在 我 里 面 是 毫 无 所有 。在我们今天的课程中，耶稣向我们证明他的能力超过魔鬼，魔鬼知道这一点。

Our lesson further teaches us about faith. Jesus teaches Jairus. As they walk together to his house, Jesus shows him a woman who was healed because of her faith in Jesus. Jarius’ faith is tested when he learnsthat his daughter died. Jesus speaks to Jarius and to us. Don’t be afraid, only believe…

我们的课程进一步教导我们关于信心。耶稣教导睚鲁。当他们一起去他家时，耶稣给他看一个妇人因为相信耶稣的信心被医治。当睚鲁知道他的女儿死了的时候，他的信心受到考验。耶稣对睚鲁和我们说话。不要怕，只要信。。。
