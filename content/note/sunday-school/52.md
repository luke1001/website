##### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US. 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

Our lesson today shows us the many people who were waiting for Jesus. Some were poor, some lived in Jerusalem all of  their lives. Some were Jewish people who worked in the temple .They knew and studied  the Scriptures every day. Some were very wealthy and educated.

今天的课程向我们显示很多人在等待耶稣。有些人贫穷，有些人一生住在耶路撒冷。有些人是住在圣殿的犹太人。他们明白圣经，每天学习经文。有些人非常富有并且很有学问。


The Magi  were probably from a country called Babylon (now Iraqi) They were a class of people who served their king as priests, and astronomers . Daniel had been the leader of the Magi when he lived in Babylon 600 years before Jesus was born. It could have been Daniel who told people about the coming of our Savior. It could be that these Magi passed this hope down to the next generation of Magi.

博士很可能来自于一个叫巴比伦（现今伊拉克）的地区。他们是一班像祭祀和天文学家那样为王服侍的人。在耶稣出生前600年，但以理生活在巴比伦时就是博士的领袖。可能是但以理告诉那里的百姓关于我们的救主的到来。可能就是这些博士把这个盼望传承给下一代的博士。

God put a special star in the sky. He revealed to the Magi that it would lead them to their Savior, if they followed it to the East.


神在天空放了一颗特别的星星。他向博士启示如果他们跟随这颗星去东方，它将带领他们找到救主。

The gifts the Magi brought were expensive and perfect for Jesus, the God-man who would die for all people.  Gold means royalty-Jesus is our King. Frankincense is like the incense that was burned as a prayer to God in the temple. Jesus is God. Myrrh was a perfume that was used in burial. Jesus is Man.

博士给为世人舍命的神人——耶稣带的礼物是贵重而完美的。黄金意味着王权——耶稣是我们的王。乳香就像我们向神的祷告如在圣殿燃烧的沉香一般。耶稣是神。没药是用于埋葬的香料。耶稣是人。

God guided each of these people to find and worship Jesus.  How could all of these people find this Baby?

神带领他们每个人找到耶稣，敬拜耶稣。这些人是怎样找到圣婴的？

Scripture prophesies were fulfilled.  Micah 2:5 tells that Bethlehem will be the birthplace of God’s  Leader of His people.  Hosea 11:1 foretold that Jesus would live in Egypt for a time. Jeremiah 31:15 tells of the sadness that Herod caused in Bethlehem.  Matthew 2: 23 tells us that prophets told that Jesus would live in Nazareth.

圣经的预言都被应验。玛拉基书2:5 告诉我们伯利恒将是神子民的领袖的出生地。何西阿书11:1 预言耶稣将在埃及生活一段时间。耶利米书31:15 讲述希律王在伯利恒对百姓制造悲剧。马太福音2: 23告诉我们先知说耶稣将生活在拿撒勒。

The Holy Spirit showed Himself in songs that people sang.)

**祷告：** 神圣的耶稣。你从天上降卑为人，为了拯救我脱离永远的死亡。这个圣诞节我满心感谢你。我要称颂你，像亚拿和西面一样敬拜和赞美你。我一生要荣耀你的名，服侍所有你要我服侍的人。我爱你，耶稣。阿门。
