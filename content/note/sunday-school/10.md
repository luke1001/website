##### Relationships – What is our response to discipline? 关系 - 我们对于管教的反应

1. Last week we talked about discipline.

    上个礼拜我们讲了管教。

    Our response to discipline needs to be a repentant and loving heart.

    我们对于管教应有一颗悔改和友爱的心。

    Prov 3:11-12 (NIV) My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent his rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.

    箴言3：11-12（新国际版） 我儿，你不可轻看耶和华的管教，（或作惩治）也不可厌烦他的责备。因为耶和华所爱的，他必责备。正如父亲责备所喜爱的儿子。

    Sinful responses to discipline are anger, or frustration, or revenge. God disciplines us because we are His children. He loves us with a love we cannot understand.

    对管教恶意的回应是愤怒，沮丧或复仇。上帝管教我们因为我们是他的孩子。他给予我们的爱是我们所不能理解的。

    God wants us to share in His Holiness, which means, to be in heaven with Him.

    上帝想让我们去分享他的圣洁，也就是说，与他同在天堂里。

    God’s only purpose in disciplining us is to help us keep our faith, so that we will be in heaven with Him.

    上帝管教我们的唯一的目就是帮我们保持信念这样我们就会和他一起住在天堂。

    Hebrews 12:10 God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.

    希伯来书 12：10万灵的父管教我们，是要我们得益处，使我们在他的圣洁上有分。

2. How can we love a God or a parent or a teacher who disciplines us?

    我们如何爱管教我们的上帝、家长或老师？

    Romans 5:5 God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.

    罗马书5：5 盼望不至于羞耻，因为所赐给我们的圣灵将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。

    Loving our God or parents, or teachers when we need discipline is not something we can do without the Holy Spirit giving us that love.

    当我们需要管教的时候还能去爱我们的家长、上帝或老师，这只有圣灵浇灌的爱才能使我们做得到。

3. When we are disciplined we want to repent of our sin,

    当我们被管教时我们对我们的罪很懊悔。

    thank God or our parents for caring so much for us,

    感谢上帝和父母对我们无微不至的关爱，

    ask God to give us the love we need to repent, thank, and love Him and our parents.

    请求上帝给我们爱，让爱帮助我们悔改，感恩，并且爱上帝和父母。

    Prayer: We watch you on the cross this week, dear Jesus. We know you are being disciplined in our place, for our sins. You took our punishment, and yet you love us with a perfect love that is not angry, but full of peace and forgiveness. Jesus, help us to be like you, loving and forgiving. We praise you for taking our punishment. Amen.

    祷告：亲爱的耶稣，本周我们看到你在十字架上。我们知道你为我们的罪而替我们受责罚。你承担了我们应得的惩罚，你又用完全的爱来爱我们，你的爱没有怒气，而是满有平安和饶恕。耶稣，帮助我们更像你那样满有爱心和宽恕。因你替我们受罚我们赞美你。阿门。

4. Read Luke 24:1-49 for June 14. This is the story of Jesus’ resurrection.

    预习6月14号将要学习的经文路加福音24：1-49。这是耶稣复活的记载。

    God had promised a Savior to Adam and Eve.
    God promised a Savior to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and to David.

    God promised a Savior to Mary and her cousin Elizabeth.

    God promised a Savior (Jesus) to us and to all people so we would not die eternally because of our sin.

    God kept His promise. He sent His Son Jesus to be born in a stable.

    God was pleased with Jesus, His Son. He showed us that Jesus is God with the Father and Holy Spirit.

    Jesus served God’s people by teaching them about God. He gave them faith to believe in Him as he healed people and raised them from the dead.

    We are in the Kingdom of God when the Holy Spirit gives us faith to believe in Him. Zaccheus and the children received this love from Jesus, also.

    Jesus was celebrated one week before His resurrection. He led a parade. He was greeted as the King. He IS the King of Heaven.
Jesus died on the cross to save all people.

    上帝向亚当和夏娃应许了一位救主

    上帝向亚伯拉罕，以赛亚，雅各，和大卫应许了一位救主

    上帝向马利亚和她的堂姐以利沙伯应许了一位救主

    上帝向所有人应许了一位救主以致我们不会因为我们的罪而永远地死去

    上帝信守他的应许。他派耶稣来为我们的罪而死
上帝喜悦耶稣，他的儿子。他向我们显明耶稣是神，与圣父和圣灵在一起。

    耶稣藉着教导人们有关神的事情而服事人们。当他治好人的病，将他们从死里救活时，他赐给人们信心去相信他。

    当圣灵赐给我们信心去信神时，我们就在神的国里。撒该和小孩子们也从耶稣那里得到了这样的爱。阿门。

    在他复活的前一个星期，人们欢呼耶稣。有许多人跟着他。以国王的尊容待他。他是天国的王。
为了救所有的人，耶稣死在十字架上。

Jesus loves me, He who died

Heaven’s gates to open wide.

He will wash away my sin

Let His little child come in.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

The Bible tells me so.

耶稣爱我舍性命，将我罪恶洗干净；

天上荣门为我开，把他小羊引进来。

主耶稣爱我！主耶稣爱我！

主耶稣爱我！有圣书告诉我。

God loves us so much. Jesus is waiting for us in heaven. I am excited to study with you again next Saturday.
