第5部分第5课 11月14日 – 使徒行传23：12-24

#### WHO CAN BE AGAINST US? 谁能抵挡我们呢？

**Memory Passage:**  If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all-how will He (the Father) not also, along with Him( Jesus), graciously give us all things? Romans 8:31,32

**熟记章节：** 罗马书8：31 ，32 神若帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们呢？ 神既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白的赐给我们么？

**Prayer:** Thank You, Lord for bringing us together to study Your Words. Open our hearts and minds to learn, to understand, and to believe all that You tell us. For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

**祷告：** 主，谢谢你将我们聚在一起来学习你的话语。求你开启我们的心思意念来学习、明白和相信你教导我们的一切。因耶稣的名，阿门。

##### GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

1. How many people were against Paul? (The Jews opposed Paul in Corinth.- Acts 18:6. Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, caused the whole city of Ephesus to riot against Paul.- Acts 19:28,29. Paul was arrested when the Jews from the Asia stirred up the crowds in Jerusalem. Acts 21:27)

    有多少人反对保罗？（哥林多反对保罗的犹太人，-使徒行传18：6。底米丢，那位亚底米神像的银匠，引发整个以弗所城骚乱反对保罗，-使徒行传19：28，29。从亚西亚来的犹太人耸动耶路撒冷的众人捉拿了保罗，使徒行传21：27。）

2. The Jews did not want Paul to preach to the Gentiles. Anger and jealousy brought much hate into their lives and they tried to get rid of Paul. What did Paul continue to do? (Teach the Gospel. In Berea, Acts 17:10. In Athens, Acts 17:24. In Corinth- Acts 18:11. In Ephesus-Acts 19:8, and many other places.)

    犹太人不想保罗向外邦人传福音。生气和嫉妒使他们生活里满了怨恨，他们千方百计要害保罗。保罗却继续做什么？（传讲福音。在庇哩亚，使徒行传17：10。在雅典，使徒行传17：24。在哥林多，使徒行传18：11。在以弗所，使徒行传19：8，以及其他许多地方。）

3. Why was Paul so brave? (He knew God was with him. Acts 18:9 , Acts 23:11)

    保罗为何如此勇敢？（他知道神与他同在。使徒行传18：9，使徒行传23：11）

##### THIS WEEK: 本周

1. The Jews are ready to kill Paul. An oath meant they would do what they had sworn. Read Acts 23:12-22. How did God stop this evil plan?

    犹太人预备好了杀保罗。誓言意味着他们将完成他们所起的誓。使徒行传23：12-22。神如何阻止了这个邪恶的计划？

2. What was the commander’s plan to save Paul from this evil plot? Read Acts 23: 23-35.

    千夫长救保罗脱离这个邪恶的阴谋的计划是什么？阅读使徒行传23：23-25。 
    
3. The Jews from Jerusalem came to Caesarea to bring charges against Paul. Read Acts 24:1-9. Who did they bring with them? 

    从耶路撒冷来的犹太人来到凯撒城控告保罗。阅读使徒行传24:1-9。他们带了谁来？

4. Paul is allowed to defend himself. Read Acts 24:10-21. How did Paul worship God?

    保罗被允许为自己辩护。阅读使徒行传24：10-21。保罗如何敬拜神？

5. Paul is given some freedom while he waits the governor’s decision. Read Acts 24:22-27. To whom did God allow Paul to tell the Gospel?

    在等候巡抚的裁决过程中，保罗享有一定的自由。阅读使徒行传24：22-27。神允许保罗向谁传讲福音？

##### GOD SPREADS HIS MESSAGE: 神传扬他的信息

1. Paul had many enemies. He continued to love them . He taught them about Jesus their Savior. He remembered that there is a Power stronger than His enemies. Who was that power? (God)

    保罗有许多敌人。但他继续爱他们。他向他们传讲他们的救主耶稣。他没有忘记有一位胜过他所有敌人的大能者。哪位大能者是谁？（神）

2. Why was Paul so sure that God would give him everything he needed? (God gave His Son to die for him. Paul was sure that God would give him all he needed. He wrote in Romans 8:31,32 “ If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all--how will He (the Father) not also, along with Him( Jesus), graciously give us all things? )

    为什么保罗确信神会赐给他一切的需要？（神将独生子赐给他，并为他而死。所以保罗确信神将赐给他一切的需要。他在罗马书8：31，32写道，“神若帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们呢？ 神（圣父）既不爱惜自己的儿子为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他（耶稣）一同白白的赐给我们么？”）

3. Think of the people who are against you. You can always be sure that someone is on your side. Who is never against you? (Jesus)

    思考一下那些反对你的人。你可以确定地知道总有人与你一边。谁从来不会与你为敌？（耶稣）

4. Why are you sure that God will give you all you need? (He already gave His Son for me, He will give us all things as he promised.

    你为什么如此确信神将赐给你一切的需要？（他已经将他的儿子赐给了我。他一定会赐给我他所应许的一切。）

**Prayer:** Thank you, Heavenly Father, for giving us Your Son to take away our sins. Thank You for making us sure that You will not allow anyone to take us away from You! Give us a strong faith to believe this wonderful promise. Because of Jesus’ we pray. Amen.

**祷告：**天父，谢谢你将你的独生子赐给我们担当我们的罪过。谢谢你让我们确定地知道你不允许任何人将我们从你那里夺走。你赐给我们坚定的信心来相信这个奇妙的应许。奉耶稣基督的名，阿门。
