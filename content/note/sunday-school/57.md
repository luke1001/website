God gives us many pictures of His forgiveness in the Bible. In Isaiah 37:17 He says, In Your love You kept me from the pit of destruction;
You have put all my sins behind your back*. God wants us to understand and believe that Jesus came to earth to die for us to forgive
our sins completely.* Isaiah 1:18 says our sins will be **white like snow.** 2 Corinthians 5:21 says Jesus **has become** our sinful self. 1
Corinthians 6:11 says He has **washed** away our sins. 1 John 1:7-9 says He has **made us clean. **

神在圣经中给了我们很多他赦罪的画面。以赛亚书中38:17他说**你 因 爱 我 的灵 魂 （ 或 译 ： 生 命 ） 便 救 我 脱 离 败 坏 的 坑 ， 因 为 你 将 我
一 切 的 罪 扔 在 你 的 背 後。**神要我们明白并相信耶稣来到世上为我们而死，完全赦免我们的罪，以赛亚书1:18说我们的罪必**变成雪白**。哥林多后书5:21说 耶稣替 我 们 **成 为**罪 。哥林多前书6:11 说 他已经洗净我们的罪。约翰一书1:7-9说他已经**使我们洁净**。

##### Notes on the lesson: 本课注释：

As a teacher, Jesus never taught an untruth, or said something wrong.People noticed when he taught, that he taught with authority. He was the
final authority. No one knew the Gospel better than He did.

作为一个老师，耶稣从未教导一个谬误，或讲错误的东西。人们注意到他教导的时候带着权柄。他有决定性的权威。没有人比他更懂福音。

Jesus began getting rid of the devils that had settled in people. He simply told them to get out, or go away. No devil could resist Jesus’
command. Jesus has more power than any devil, even today.

耶稣开始驱逐附在人身上的邪灵。他仅仅告诉他们出去，或离开。没有邪灵能违抗耶稣的命令。即使在今天，耶稣比任何邪灵更有能力。

The Pharisees were leaders in the synagogue, their church or temple. Throughout Jesus ministry they challenged Jesus. They acted very holy,
and could not admit to their own need for a Savior. They were jealous of the crowds that listened to Jesus.

法利赛人是会堂的领袖，会堂就是他们教会或圣殿。他们处处挑战耶稣的事工。他们表现得敬虔，但不承认他们自己需要一位救主。群从听从耶稣的话，他们对此感到嫉妒。

Tax collectors were men who collected money from people for the government. They were not respected by the Jews because they worked for
the hated government and they often dishonestly overcharged the people. The Jews called them “ sinners”.

税吏是为政府向百姓征收钱财的人。他们不受犹太人的尊敬，因为他们为被人厌恶的政府效力，他们经常欺诈百姓，高额征税。犹太人称他们为“罪人”。

Jesus was accused of blasphemy in our lesson for today. To blaspheme means to claim to be God or to insult God.

在我们今天的课程中，耶稣被指控说僭妄的话。说僭妄的话意味着自称为神或亵渎神。
