#### God Keeps All of His Promises All the Time. 神自始至终遵守诺言

Session 3- Lesson 4 – March 7 Review Exodus 7&8, New Lesson- Exodus 9 & 10

第三部分——第四课——3月7号 回顾出埃及记7和8章，新课——出埃及记9和10章

Prayer: Heavenly Father, thank you for our families and friends who support us in our faith. Thank you for bringing us together again today to learn more about the love you have for us. Open our hearts and give us faith to believe your words. For Jesus’ sake. Amen.

祷告：天父，为了在信仰上支持我们的家人和朋友，我们感谢你。谢谢你今天把我们聚集在一起，进一步学习你对我们的爱。请打开我们的心，赐给我们信心相信你的话语。奉主耶稣的圣名。阿门。

**Memory Passages:** The Lord is faithful to all His promises, and loving to all He has made. Psalm 145:13

**记忆经句：** 耶和华信守他的诺言，向一切受造之物彰显慈爱。诗篇145:13 （圣经上注脚说大多数马所拉文本中没有最后这句经文，所以中文和合本圣经没有对这句英文经文进行翻译,是我自己翻的）

Not one of the Lord’s good promises to the house of Israel failed, every one was fulfilled. Joshua 21:45

耶 和 华 应 许 赐 福 给 以 色 列 家 的 话 一 句 也 没 有 落 空 ， 都 应 验 了 。约书亚记21:45

##### God’s Loving Plan to Save Us: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：

1. How did God show His power to Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites?

    神怎样向摩西，亚伦，和以色列民显示他的大能？

2. Why was it important for them to see God’s power? (Their faith became stronger. Moses and Aaron did as God commanded without complaining. The children of Israel listened to Moses and Aaron and the words God spoke through them. They all began to trust God’s promise to take them to the land of Canaan.)

    为什么让他们见到神的大能很重要？（他们的信心变得更坚定。摩西和亚伦毫无怨言按照神的命令去做。以色列子民听从神通过摩西和亚伦所说的话。他们都开始相信神要带他们去迦南地的应许。）

3. How did God show the Egyptians, the Pharaoh’s officials, and Pharaoh that He was the true God?

    神怎样向埃及人，法老的臣仆，和法老显示他是真正的神？

4. The Egyptians worshipped many gods. Many were gods of nature. The sun, the moon, the stars. Animals like crocodiles, cats, and insects, like beetles. The Nile River, the earth. What was God showing Pharaoh by turning his gods into plagues?

    埃及人敬拜很多假神。这些假神来自于自然界。像太阳，月亮，星星。动物中有鳄鱼，猫，还有昆虫，比如像甲虫。还有尼罗河，大地。神把他们敬拜的假神变成灾害要向法老证明什么？

##### This Week: God Does What He Said He Would Do. 本周：神言出必行。

    神给法老一个承诺。读9:13-22.这个承诺是什么？神让法老存在的理由是什么？（16节）神给法老什么指示来挽救埃及人？你如何判断有些埃及人相信神？

##### God Prepares His People for a Savior. 神为他的子民预备一位救主。

1. Who made promises in this lesson? (God promised that Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go. Moses promised Pharaoh that plagues would come. Pharaoh promised that he would like the Israelites go. ) Can promises be for good and evil? Which of the promises in this lesson were for good. Which were for evil?

2. Who kept their promises? (God and Moses, through God.) Do you know of any promises that God has broken? Not one of the Lord’s good promises to the house of Israel failed, every one was fulfilled. Joshua 21:45 Where did God promise to take the Israelites? Who was promised to the Israelites to redeem them? Did God keep His promises to His people?

    谁遵守了诺言？（神和摩西，通过神）你知道神曾经违背过任何诺言吗？耶 和 华 应 许 赐 福 给 以 色 列 家 的 话 一 句 也 没 有 落 空 ， 都 应 验 了 。约书亚记21:45 神应许带以色列民去哪里？神应许以色列民来拯救他们的人是谁？ 神对他的子民信守诺言了吗？
