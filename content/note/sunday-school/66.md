**GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US:  神拯救我们的慈爱计划：**

~ Transfigure means to change into something more beautiful. Jesus was changed from His human person  to His heavenly person in this lesson. Matthew 17:2 tells us that Jesus’ face “shone like the sun!” What a sight to see!!!

变像的意思是使事情变得更美好。本课中耶稣从人性的身体变成神性的身体。马太福音17:2 告诉我们耶稣的脸“像太阳一样发光。！”多么奇妙的情景！！！

~ Elijah was a faithful prophet of God many years ago. He had to tell a king that he was sinning against God.   He brought many Israelites back to faith in God by preaching the Gospel as the Holy Spirit directed. He was taken to heaven without dying, in a fiery chariot. In our lesson today, He appears with Jesus, and Jesus compares him to John the Baptist.

以利亚是许多年以前神忠实的先知。他必须指出王正在得罪神。他按照圣灵的指示传播福音使很多以色列民归信。他没有经过死亡，被火车火马带到天国。在今天的课程中，他和耶稣一起出现，耶稣把他比作施洗约翰。

~Moses was the prophet whom God chose to lead His people out of Egypt. God give him the 10 Commandments to teach to His people. God instructed Moses to tell the Israelites about Jesus’ coming to earth to save all people.

摩西是神拣选带领他的子民出埃及的先知。神给他十诫教导他的子民。神指示摩西把耶稣来到世上拯救所有人的事告诉以色列民。

Help us to be humble like you. Help us to love everyone, forgive everyone, and tell everyone about You and Your heaven. Amen.
