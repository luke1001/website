#### The Old Covenant 旧约

Moses had received the law from God. This law set God’s people apart as their own nation. We saw the beautiful celebration of their covenant agreement – you will see in Jeremiah today that this was actually like a marriage promise between God and his people.

摩西已经从神那领受了律法。律法使神的子民分别出来成为自己的民族。我们看到对他们的约定的美好的庆祝——你今天在耶利米 书中将看到这个约实际上就像神与子民之间的婚约。

1. Read Exodus 32:1-6 What did Moses’ brother Aaron agree to do for the people while Moses was on the mountain with God? Why does this surprise you?

    读出埃及记32:1-6 当摩西和神在山上时，他的哥哥亚伦同意为以色列民做什么事？为什么这让你很惊讶？

2. Exodus 32: 7-10 What did God tell Moses he wants to do? Notice in verse 7 God says “your” people - not “my” people. He is showing Moses how much the people have hurt his heart.

    出埃及记32: 7-10 神告诉摩西他要做什么？注意第7节神说“你的”百姓不是“我的”百姓。他向摩西表明这些百姓多么让他伤心。

3. Exodus 32: 11-12 What does Moses ask God to do? God allowed Moses to experience the love that was in his heart.

    出埃及记32: 11-12 摩西要神做什么？神允许摩西体验他心中的爱。

4. Who is at the right hand of God today praying for his mercy to be on us? (Romans 8: 34)

    谁在神的右手边为我们祈求神的怜悯？（罗马书8: 34)

5. Exodus 32: 13-14 Moses quotes God’s promise back to him. God loves for us to remember his promises to us and pray them to him. Can you think of some promises God has given you that comfort you?

    出埃及记32: 13-14 摩西引用神的应许来回应他。神对我们的爱，想起他对我们的应许。摩西向神恳求他的应许。你能想起一些神给你的，使你得到安慰的应许吗？

6. How did God react to Moses ’prayer?

    神怎样回应摩西的祷告？

7. Exodus 32: 15-21 What did Moses do when he went down from the mountain and actually saw the idol worship of the Israelites?

    出埃及记32: 15-21 当摩西下了山，真的看到以色列民拜偶像时，他做了什么？

8. Who had engraved the stone tablets? v. 16

    谁在石版上刻字？16节

9. Exodus 32: 22-35 What is the consequence of their sin in verse 28 and verse 35? Just imagine how much God loved his people – like a father and like a Bridegroom. When they worshiped an idol it was the same to God as a wife committing adultery against her husband or a child running away from home.

    出埃及记32: 22-35 在28和35节里他们的罪的后果是什么？只要想象神多么爱他的子民——就像一位父亲和一位新郎。当他们拜偶像时，对神而言，就如一个妻子背叛自己的丈夫或是一个孩子离家出走一样。

10. What God want his people to know by punishing them for their idolatry? Who took the punishment of hell for all people?

    神惩罚他的子民拜偶像，为了让他们明白什么？谁承担了所有人下地狱的惩罚？

11. We are tempted also to worship idols. Our idols are not golden calves – but what could they be?

    我们也受到拜偶像的试探。我们的偶像不是金牛犊——它们是什么？

12. Read Jeremiah 31:31-33 In what phrase do you see the Father relationship of God to his people?

    读耶利米书31:31-33 在哪个表达中你看见神与子民的关系是父子关系？

13. In what phrase do you see the husband relationship of God to his people?

14. What is the new covenant that God is promising his people? How did God keep his promise?

    神向子民应许的新约是什么？神怎样遵守他的应许？

15. How did God show his new covenant love to the Israelites with Moses?

    神怎样向摩西带领的以色列民彰显他在新约中的爱？

Matthew 26:27-29 This is the fulfillment of the promise of a new covenant!

马太福音26:27-29 这就是新约的应许的实现！

结束的祷告和你的祷告请求：谢谢耶稣，你宝血所立的新约洗净了我所有的罪。当我受试探远离你的时候，请让我想起你宽容罪的慈爱。
