**GOD'S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US:**

**神拯救我们的慈爱计划：**

There are three ways to go from Jerusalem to Galilee. The way Jesus and the disciples walked was the least favored because the Jews did not think well of Samaritans. Jesus took His disciples through the country of Samaria. Jesus had a special reason for going this way. Samaritans and Jews did not speak to each other. He -wanted-  to talk to a Samaritan.

从耶路撒冷至加利利有三条路。耶稣和门徒走的是一条犹太人最不喜欢走的路，因为他们看不起撒玛利亚人。耶稣带着门徒走过撒玛利亚人的地盘。耶稣走这条路有着特殊的原因。那时撒玛利亚人和犹太人互不交谈。他-想-与撒玛利亚人交谈。

The Samarians worshipped God on Mount Gerizim, near where Abraham and Jacob had built altars  about 2 thousand of years before. The Samaritans and Jews fought in their long history. Feeling were not good between them.

撒玛利亚人在基利心山上敬拜神，靠近二千年前亚伯拉罕和雅各筑坛的地方。撒玛利亚人和犹太人历史上长年争战。他们相互感觉很差。

Jesus teaches. He uses " food" and" water " to teach spiritual truths about Himself and His Father. He teaches the disciples about the mission they are on by comparing it to a "harvest". Jesus draws  pictures for so that we can better understand the important things He wants us to know. Let's watch for more pictures as Jesus teaches us.

耶稣教导。他用"食物"和"水"教导关于他自己和他的父的属灵真理。他将他与门徒正在从事的事工与"收割"作比较来教导他们。耶稣使用图像来更好地帮助理解他要我们理解的重要的事。让我们留意耶稣教导我们时所使用的更多图像。
