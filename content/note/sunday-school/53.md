**GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US:**

**神拯救我们的慈爱计划：**

Imagine this: You and Jesus are on your way to the Passover celebration in Jerusalem. The 102 kilometer walk takes 17 hours through hilly country. You find drinking water in wells along the way. From the top of the hills you may be able to see the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Do you think 12 year old Jesus would have fun along the way? What would you do on a long walk like this?

想象一下：你和耶稣在去往耶路撒冷庆祝逾越节的路上。102公里的山路程花了17个小时行走。你们沿途找到可饮用的井水喝。从山顶你可以看见地中海和加利利海。你觉得12岁的耶稣一路会开心吗？你在这样的长途跋涉中会做什么？

What is the Passover? Each spring, Jesus’ parents and many other people walked to Jerusalem to celebrate a Festival commanded by God. Every man was to worship and praise God in Jerusalem. They sang Psalms and listened to the reading of the history of their people in Egypt. They ate lamb and flat bread .. God commanded that the Jewish people celebrate this every year to remember also how He saved them from their hard life in Egypt. God commanded them to roast a perfect lamb to remind them that Jesus, the Lamb of God would come to save them .

什么是逾越节？每一个春天，耶稣的父母亲和许多人步行去耶路撒冷庆祝神命定的节日。每一个人将在耶路撒冷敬拜和赞美神。他们唱赞美诗，听讲当年他们的百姓在埃及的历史。他们吃羊羔和无酵饼。神命令犹太子民每年庆祝逾越节，为了纪念神怎样把他们从埃及的艰苦生活中拯救出来。神命令他们烤一只没有瑕疵的羊羔，提醒他们耶稣就是神的羔羊，将要来拯救他们。

John, Zachariah’s son also grew up. When he and Jesus were 30 years old they began the ministries that God had called them to. John lived in the desert. His message brought people out of the cities to the Jordon River. Why was he called John the Baptist?

约翰，撒加利亚的儿子也长大了。当他和耶稣30岁时，他们开始进行神呼召他们的服事。约翰住在旷野。他的信息把人从城市带到约旦河。为什么他被称为施洗约翰。
