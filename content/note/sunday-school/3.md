Bible Lesson Homework

圣经课家庭作业

-The Promise of a Savior is repeated in many times in the Old Testament. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob received the Promise of a Savior.

救主的应许在旧约中被承诺了很多次。亚伯拉罕，以赛亚，雅各都领受了救主的应许。

Jacob received the promise in a beautiful dream. Read Genesis 28: 10-22. Look for these words in verse 14.“All people on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.”

雅各在梦中领受了他的应许。阅读创世纪 28：10-22. 注意看14节里的这些词语：¡¡ã 你的后裔必像地上的尘沙那样多，必向东西南北开展。地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。¡¡À

-Jacob sinned by lying to his father. He repented. He was sorry he had lied. God forgave him. His father forgave Jacob also.

雅各因对他的父亲说谎而犯了罪。他为此感到抱歉。上帝原谅了他。他的父亲也原谅了雅各。

God has given us parents to lead and guide as we grow older. He wants us to honor them, as Jacob learned to do. He wants us to honor our parents and obey them. Ephesians 6:1 & 2 , Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. “Honor your father and mother.”

上帝赐予我们父母在我们的成长过程中引导我们。他希望我们荣耀父母，就像雅各学会做的那样。他希望我们荣耀并服从我们的父母.以弗所书第六章1，2 “你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。要孝敬父母，使你得福，在世长寿。这是第一条带应许的诫命”

--God’s love is for everyone. Here is a song to sing this week:

Jesus loves me this I know

As He loved so long ago.

Taking children on his knee

Saying ,”Let them come to me.”

Yes, Jesus loves me.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

The Bible tells me so.

神的爱是针对每一个人的。本周我们学习下面的诗歌：

耶稣爱我舍性命，

将我罪恶洗干净，

天上荣美为我开，

把他小羊引进来，

主耶稣爱我，

主耶稣爱我

主耶稣爱我，

有圣书告诉我

-Please try to memorize John 3:16-God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son.

Review Genesis 1: 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

-请默记约翰福音3:16 -- 神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。

复习创世纪1：1 -- 起初神创造天地

God loves us so much. He sent Jesus to die for us. I am excited to study with you again next Saturday.Remember, Jesus love you.

神非常爱我们。他差遣了耶稣来为我们死。我非常高兴地与你们下周六一起学习。记住，耶稣爱你。

Lesson Plan 4- April 19


第四课 4月19号

Prayer: Dear Jesus, on this Easter Eve, we thank you for allowing us to study together again. Be with us today. Make our faith grow as we talk about your Plan to take us to heaven. Thank You for dying for us. Thank You for rising so long ago and giving us the Bible to know all that you did for us. Thank You for Your eternal love. Amen.

##### Review 复习

1. How did God’s perfect world become imperfect? (The devil tempted Adam and Eve to disobey God’s command. They ate fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.)

    上帝的世界是如何变的不完美的？【魔鬼诱惑亚当和夏娃不去服从上帝的命令。他们吃了善恶树上的果子】

2. What was God’s plan to save them from eternal death? (God would send a Savior who would die, but rise again to show His victory over the devil.)

    上帝将他们从永恒的死亡中救赎的计划是什么？【上帝会派遣一位救主，他会死去但后又复活，以此显示他战胜了魔鬼。】

3. Who is stronger, Jesus or the devil? (Jesus is stronger.)

    谁更强大，耶稣还是魔鬼? 【耶稣更强大】

    Why are we also imperfect? Sin entered the world through one man, (Adam and Eve) and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned. ..Romans 5:12. We receive our sinful nature from our parents. Since Adam and Eve sinned all their children were sinful. No one was ever born perfect again.

    我们为何也如此不完美？ 【这就如罪是从一人（亚当和夏娃）入了世界，死又是从罪来的，于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪…罗马书5：12。我们从我们的父母继承了罪。自从亚当和夏娃犯了罪，他们的所有后代都是有罪的。再没有人生来就是完美的。】

##### Jacob and God’s Plan of Salvation 雅各和上帝的拯救计划

** This section is from Lesson 3 –Questions 1-7

这一节来自于第三课的1-7题

1. God told many people about His Plan of Salvation in the Old Testament. There are many accounts of the lives of these believers. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three of the faithful believers of the Old Testament.

    上帝在旧约里告诉许多人关于他的拯救计划。有很多关于那些信徒们生平的记载。亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各是旧约的三个忠实的信徒。

2. Jacob was leaving home. He was going to his uncle Laban. He had lied to his father and his brother. He was afraid and sorry that he had sinned. Read Genesis 28:10-17.

    雅各要离开家去他的叔叔拉班那里。他不得不对他的父、兄说谎。他为自己的罪感到恐惧和抱歉。【见 创世纪 28：10 – 17】

3. Where did Jacob sleep? (Jacob slept on the ground with a stone for a pillow.)

    雅各在哪里睡的觉？ 【 雅各在地上以石为枕而睡】

4. What was Jacob’s dream? (He dreamed of angels going up and down a stairway. The stairway reached from the ground to heaven. God was at the top. God talked to Jacob in his dream)

    雅各做了什么梦？ 【他梦见天使在阶梯上上上下下，那阶梯从地下通往天国。上帝在顶端，在梦里与雅各说话。】

5. Which five things did God promise Jacob？

    上帝应许了雅各哪五件事？

    God promised:

    -to give Jacob the land on which he was lying.

    -his family would be so large he could not count them.

    -all people on earth would be blessed through Jacob’s family. Jesus would be born from his family. Verse 14 says, “All people on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.”

    -He would always be with Jacob.

    -He would bring Jacob back to the land God promised him.)

    上帝应许：

    赐给雅各他所趟卧之地

    他的后裔多不胜数

    地上万族必因他和他的后裔得福，这是因为耶稣将要从他的后裔中降生。14节说，“地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。”

    上帝永远和雅各同在

    上帝会带雅各回到应许之地

6. Did God keep all of those promises? Yes He did! 
    上帝兑现这些承诺了嘛？ 【是的！】

7. Did you notice that the great believers in the Bible are all sinners?

    你注意到了圣经里那些伟大的信徒都是罪人吗？

##### ** New section of Lesson 4 begins here. 第四课

##### Relationships – God, parents, children  关系- 上帝， 父母， 孩子

Let’s compare family relationships and our relationship with God.

让我们来比较家庭之间，以及我们与上帝间的关系。

1. God created man and woman in His holy image. Children are born in parent’s sinful image.

    上帝以他圣洁的形象创造了男人和女人。孩子降生时带着父母罪的形象。

2. God is our Father. He loves us and guides us perfectly. God gave parents to every child on earth. These parents love and guide their children.

    上帝是我们的父。他爱我们并完美的引导我们。上帝给世上每一个孩子父母。这些父母爱着并引导他们的孩子。

3. God disciplines us to keep us close to Him. Our parents discipline children to keep them close to God.

    上帝约束我们使我们一直靠近他。家长们约束孩子让他们更靠近上帝。

4. God wants us to honor, love and obey Him. God wants children to honor, love, and obey Him and their parents.

    上帝想让我们荣耀，爱戴，并且遵从他。上帝希望孩子荣耀，爱戴，并且遵从他和他们自己的父母。

    Ephesians 6:1,2- Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and mother.”

    以弗所书第六章1，2 “你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。要孝敬父母，使你得福，在世长寿。这是第一条带应许的诫命”

5. Can you think of a reason why obeying parents is very necessary? (Children need to honor, love and obey their parents so that they can do the job God gave them. Our parent’s job is to teach children about God. They need to teach us about God's Plan of Salvation, and all of God's love and help for giving us a successful and fulfilling life in Jesus。

    你可否想一个为何服从家长非常有必要的原因？ (孩子需要去荣耀，爱戴，并且遵从他们的家长这样他们就可以完成上帝交给他们的工作。我们父母的工作是教导孩子关于上帝。他们要教我们上帝的救赎计划，和上帝一切的爱和帮助，为了能使我们在耶稣里拥有成功完满的生命。)

Dear Father in Heaven, Thank You for sending your Son to be our Savior! Thank You for loving us so much. Thank You for forgiving us all of the bad that we do. Thank You for keeping all of your promises. Because of Jesus we pray. Amen.

我们在天上的父，感谢你派你的儿子耶稣来做我们的救主。感谢你如此爱我们。感谢你原谅我们一切的过错。感谢你信守了一切应许。奉主耶稣基督的名求。阿门。

3. Read Luke 1; 26-28 and Luke 1:46-55 Now we are going to study from the New Testament. The book that tells of Jesus’ birth is the book of Luke, the third book in the New Testament.

God had promised a Savior to Adam and Eve.
