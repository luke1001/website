##### God’s Loving Plan to Save Us 神救赎我们的慈爱计划

1. After Jesus ascended into heaven His disciples preached to many people in Jerusalem. Every day they told people in the temple or in their homes that Jesus was Christ, the Son of God. Stephen was a teacher for Jesus. Some people did not believe Stephen’s words about Jesus and caused him to be brought to court. Here he told the story of the patriarchs. Patriarchs were the people to whom God had given the promise of a Savior, 2 thousand years ago. Notice that in Acts 7:8, Stephen talks about Jacob. Jacob was the man who ran from his angry brother Esau, and received the promise of the Savior in a dream of angels walking up and down a staircase to heaven. Remember?

    在耶稣升天之后，祂的门徒在耶路撒冷向很多人传道。每天他们都在殿里或是家里向人们传讲耶稣是基督，神的独生子。司提反是一个教导关于耶稣的事的教师。有些人不信司提反所讲的关于耶稣的事，就把他带到公会里。在那里，他传讲了族长们的故事。在两千多年前，神应许族长们将要赐给他们一位救赎主。请注意在使徒行传7:8,司提反提到了雅各。雅各曾因为他哥哥以扫的怒气而逃跑，并且在梦里得到关于救主的应许，他看见天使在一个通往天上的梯子上，上去下来。你想起来了吗？
