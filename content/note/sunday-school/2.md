##### Bible Lesson Homework 圣经课家庭作业

Our third lesson will tell how God’s perfect world became sinful. Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s rule about eating fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Read Genesis Chapter 3. The world is now full of sin and sadness.

-我们的第三堂课将讲述神的完美世界如何变成了有罪的世界。亚当和夏娃违背了神的规定：不可吃分别善恶树上的果子。阅读创世纪第3章。这个世界现在充满罪和忧伤。

God had a plan to give everyone eternal life and eternal joy. Verse 15 is God’s Promise of a Savior to Adam and Eve.

神有一个计划要赐给每一个人永恒的生命和永恒的喜乐。第15节是神给亚当和夏娃一个救主的应许。

-This Promise of a Savior is repeated in many times in the Old Testament. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob received the Promise of a Savior.

这个差遣救主的应许在旧约里重申了许多次。亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各收到了这个差遣救主的应许

Jacob received the promise in a beautiful dream. Read Genesis 28: 10-22. Look for these words in verse 14. “All people on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.”

雅各在一个美丽的梦中收到这个应许。阅读创世纪28：10-22。在14节里寻找这语句. “ 地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。”

--God’s love is for everyone. Here is a song to sing this week:

--神的爱是针对每一个人的。本周我们学习下面的诗歌：

Jesus loves me this I know

For the Bible tells me so.

Little ones to Him belong.

They are weak, but He is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

Yes, Jesus loves me.

The Bible tells me so.

耶稣爱我我知道，

因有圣书告诉我

凡小孩子主牧养，

我虽软弱主强壮

主耶稣爱我，

主耶稣爱我

主耶稣爱我，

有圣书告诉我

-Think about this. Which part of God’s creation week is your favorite?

-思考一下。神创造的一周中的哪一部分是你最喜欢的？

-Please try to memorize Genesis 1:1- In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

    神怎样造夏娃？（神使亚当沉睡，他取下亚当的一条肋骨，又把肉合起造出了夏娃。）

3. How do you know Adam was happy to have a wife? (Adam was excited to see the beautiful woman made out of him.”She is my bones and my flesh.”)

    你如何知道亚当很高兴有一个妻子？（看到一个从自己造出来的漂亮女人，亚当很兴奋。“她是我的骨、我的肉。”）

4. What did God say about the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? (No one should eat from it. If they did eat fruit from it they would die.)

    关于分辨善恶树，神说了什么？（没有人可以吃它的果子。如果他们吃了它的果子就会死。）

    John 3:16 –God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son. That whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

##### What happened to God’s Perfect World? - Genesis Chapter 3 上帝的完美世界发生了什么？ - 创世纪 第3章

1. Who entered the Perfect Garden of Eden in the form of a serpent or snake? (The devil.)

    是谁以毒蛇，或蛇的样子进入了完美的伊甸园？（魔鬼）

2. What did the devil convince Eve to do? (The devil reasoned with Eve until she ate fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.)

    魔鬼说服夏娃做了什么事情？（魔鬼劝说夏娃直到她想去吃分辨善恶树上的果子。）

3. With whom did she share the fruit? (Eve shared her fruit with her husband, Adam.)

    夏娃和谁分享了善恶树上的果实？（夏娃和他的丈夫亚当分享了善恶树上的果实。）

4. Why did God place the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the center of the garden? (He gave Adam and Eve a chance to show their love to Him by not eating from the tree as He asked.) 

    上帝为什么要将分辨善恶树放在伊甸园的中间？ （他给亚当和夏娃一个机会选择不吃善恶树的果子从而来表现他们对上帝的爱。）

5. What did God say would happen to Adam and Eve if they ate fruit from this tree? (They would die instead of living forever in the perfect Garden. Disobeying God brought badness and sin into the world. Sin is disobeying God.)

    上帝告诉夏娃和亚当如果吃了分辨善恶树上的果子他们将会怎样？ （他们会死去，而不是在完美的伊甸园里永远活着。违背上帝旨意的结果是将邪恶和罪带入了世界。 罪就是违背上帝。）

6. God found Adam and Eve in the Garden after they sinned. He loved them, but He had to tell them what their sin would make their life very hard. They would die forever. But God had a plan to save them. God said that (Genesis 3:15)

    He (Jesus, God’s Son) would destroy the devil, but the devil would hurt Jesus.

    This happened thousands of years later when Jesus died on the cross.

    亚当和夏娃犯罪以后，上帝在伊甸园里找到了他们。他爱他们，但他必须告诉夏娃和亚当，他们的罪使他们的生活很艰难。他们将会永远地死去。但上帝有一个拯救他们的计划，上帝告诉他们 （创世纪 3章 十五节）

    他 （耶稣，上帝的儿子）将会摧毁魔鬼，但魔鬼也会伤害耶稣。

    这在几千年后耶稣被钉十字架的时候发生了。

7. Adam and Eve began their new life outside of the perfect garden. It is a life like ours. We have pain, sadness. Bad things happen to us. This evil and badness never happened in God’s perfect world. In the Bible, God tells us that he has a perfect place for us to live forever. It is called heaven...

    亚当和夏娃在完美的伊甸园外开始他们的新生活。那是一个象我们这样的生活。我们有苦痛，悲伤，不幸发生在我们身上。这样的罪和邪恶从未在上帝完美的世界里发生。在圣经中，上帝告诉我们他有一个完美的地方给我们（相信耶稣的人）居住。那地方名叫天堂……

8. Why are we also imperfect? Sin entered the world through one man, (Adam and Eve) and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned. ..Romans 5:12. We receive our sinful nature from our parents. Since Adam and Eve sinned all their children were sinful. No one was ever born perfect again.

    为什么我们不完美？ 这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的，于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪…罗马书5：12。我们从父母那里接收了罪，自从亚当和夏娃犯了罪，他们所有的后裔也全都是有罪的。再也没有人生来就是完美的。

##### What is God’s Plan of Salvation? 神的拯救计划是什么？

1. What is the Bible? (The Bible is the Word of God.)

    圣经是什么？（圣经是神的话语。）

2. Who wrote the Bible? (Men who believed in God wrote the Bible. God the Spirit gave them the thoughts and words to write. All Scripture is God breathed. 2Timothy 3:16)

    是谁写的圣经？（是一些相信神的人写的圣经。圣灵赐给他们当写的心思和话语。圣经是神所默示的。提摩太后书3：16）

3. The Bible is divided into parts. The Old Testament was written before Jesus Christ was born on the earth. It tells about God’s Plan of Salvation. The New Testament was written after Jesus Christ was born. It tells how God’s Plan of Salvation came true.

    圣经分成不同部分。旧约成书于耶稣基督降生到世上之情。它讲述有关神的拯救计划。新约成书于耶稣基督降生以后。它讲述了神的拯救计划的实现。

4. God told many people about His Plan of Salvation in the Old Testament. There are many accounts of the lives of these believers. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three of the faithful believers of the Old Testament.

    在旧约中，神告诉了许多的人有关他的拯救计划。有许多有关那些人生命的记述。亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各是旧约中三个忠实的信徒。

5. Jacob was leaving home. He was going to his uncle Laban. He had lied to his father and his brother. He was afraid and sorry that he had sinned. Read Genesis 28:10-17. Where did Jacob sleep? (Jacob slept on the ground with a stone for a pillow.)

    雅各离开了家。他前往他舅舅拉班家。他曾向他的父亲和哥哥撒谎。他很害怕，为自己犯了罪难过。阅读创世纪18：10-17。雅各在哪里睡觉？（雅各睡在地上，用石头当枕头。）

6. What was Jacob’s dream? (He dreamed of angels going up and down a stairway. The stairway reached from the ground to heaven. God was at the top. God talked to Jacob in his dream)

    雅各作了什么梦？（他梦见了有神的使者在梯子上，上去下来。梯子立在地上，梯子的头顶着天。神在梯子的头顶。神在梦中向雅各讲话。）

7. Which five things did God promise Jacob? (God promised Jacob the land on which he was lying. God promised Jacob his family would be so large he could not count them.God promised Jacob that all people on earth would be blessed through his family. That is because Jesus would be born from his family. Verse 14 says, “All people on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.” God promised Jacob He would always be with him. God promised Jacob He would bring him back to the land God promised him.)

    神向雅各应许了哪五件事？（神应许雅各将他所躺卧之地赐给他和他的后裔。神应许雅各他的后裔必像地上的尘沙那样多不胜数。 神应许雅各地上万族必因他和他的后裔得福，这是因为耶稣将要从他的后裔中降生。14节说，“地上万族必因你和你的后裔得福。”。神应许雅各他会一直与雅各同在。神应许雅各带领他归回神的应许之地。）

8. Did God keep all of those promises? Yes He did!

    神遵守了所有这五个应许吗？是的，神成就了所有的应许！
9. Did you notice that the great believers in the Bible are all sinners?

    Dear Father in Heaven, Thank you for sending your Son to be our Savior! Thank you for loving us so much. Thank you for forgiving us all of the bad that we do. Thank you for keeping all of your promises. Because of Jesus we pray. Amen.

    你是否注意到圣经中那些伟大的信徒全都是罪人？

    亲爱的天父，谢谢你差遣你的儿子成为我们的救主！谢谢你这么样地爱我们。谢谢你赦免我们所做的错事和坏事。谢谢你遵守了所有的应许。因为耶稣的缘故我们向你祷告。阿门。
