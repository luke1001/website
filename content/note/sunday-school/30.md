##### ENGLISH PLEASE: 英语对话：

Tom and Betty are walking to school.

汤姆和贝蒂正往学校走。

Betty: Do you remember that Jesus told His disciples to find a room for them to celebrate the Passover meal?

贝蒂：你记得耶稣吩咐他的门徒去为他们找一个屋子吃逾越节的筵席的事吗？

Tom: Yes, the disciples prepared the meal. They roasted the lamb, cleaned vegetables, and poured the bitter herbs into bowls. Each place at the table had cups for wine.

汤姆：记得，门徒预备了逾越节的筵席。他们烤了羊羔，洗干净蔬菜，把苦草倒在碗里。桌上摆满了葡萄酒杯。

Betty: Their celebration was just like the one that the Israelites celebrated for 1500 years! They obeyed God and celebrated every year to remember how God led them out of Egypt. Jesus celebrated the Passover since He was 12 years old. Do you remember how Jesus was lost in the Temple?

贝蒂：他们就像1500年前以色列民一样守逾越节！他们顺服神，每年守逾越节，为了纪念神当初带领以色列民出埃及。耶稣从12岁起就守逾越节了。你记得耶稣是怎样在圣殿里丢失的吗？

Tom: Jesus had special plans for this Passover meal. When He broke the unleavened bread, He said it was His body. And He said it was “ given for you”. He was telling them of His death in their place. He wanted them to remember His death with a celebration meal.

汤姆：耶稣对逾越节的筵席有特别的计划。当他掰开无酵饼时，他说这是他的身体。他还说这是 “为你们而舍的”。他是在告诉他们他将替他们而死。他要他们用逾越节的筵席来纪念他的死。

Betty: Then Jesus served wine to each of His disciples and told them it was His blood. He said His blood was given for each of them so that their sins would be forgiven!

贝蒂：然后耶稣给每一个门徒喝葡萄酒，并告诉他们这是他的血。他说他的血是赐给他们每一个人的，因此他们的罪将被赦免！

Tom: It was called the Lord’s Supper! It was Jesus’ last Passover meal. He said He would celebrate His Supper with us when we are all in heaven.

汤姆：我们称此为主的晚餐！这是耶稣最后一次逾越节的筵席。他说当我们都在天国时他将和我们一起庆祝主的晚餐。

2. 1500 years after the Israelites left Egypt, Jesus began His ministry in the land Canaan, or Israel. Jesus celebrated the Passover meal with his disciples the night before He died. What did Jesus use the unleavened bread for? What did He use the wine for? (Mark 14:22-25)

    以色列民离开埃及1500年后，耶稣在迦南地或以色列开始他的事工。耶稣在受难前的晚上和门徒一起吃逾越节的筵席。耶稣用无酵饼做什么？他用红酒做什么？（马可福音14:22-25)
