Jesus is Arisen. Luke 24:1-49 He is risen! This is our Easter greeting. This is what the angel said to the women who came into the opened grave early on Easter Sunday morning. God sent an angel again to tell His Good News. At which other times did God send an angel to tell of His Plan of Salvation?

耶稣已复活。路加福音24:1-49 祂复活了！这是我们在复活节时的问候。这是复活节清晨，天使对那些来到空坟墓前的妇女所说的话。神再次差遣天使来传讲祂的福音。神还在什么时候差遣了天使来向人们传讲祂的救赎计划？


Today’s lesson takes place on Sunday, the day that Jesus rose from the dead. So many things happened. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John tell about this day. Each of the Gospel writers were inspired to tell some of the same happenings, but each also wrote different incidents. All of the stories show fear and guarded joy, belief and unbelief, wonder and frustration. Let’s imagine we are with the friends of Jesus on that first Easter Day. Would we remember Jesus’s words? Would we be afraid of the guards? Would we believe the women? Would we have known Jesus? If you wish to read the entire Easter story, these are the Scripture references: Matthew 28:1-15, Mark 16:1-14; Luke 24:1-49; John 20:1-23

今天的课程内容发生在星期天，耶稣从死里复活的日子。在这一天里发生了很多事，马太、马可、路加和约翰都讲述了这一天所发生的事。每一位福音书的作者都受启示，他们对所发生的事都有一些相同的记载，但每一位也分别记载了一些不同的事。所有的这些故事都显示出了惧怕、谨慎的喜乐、信与不信、惊奇和困惑。让我们想象一下我们就在那第一个复活节中与耶稣的朋友们在一起。我们会想起耶稣的话语吗？我们会害怕那些看守的人吗？我们会相信那些妇女们吗？我们能认出耶稣来吗？如果你要想通读整个复活节的故事，以下是相关的经文：马太福音28:1-15，马可福音16:1-14，路加福音24:1-49，约翰福音20:1-23。

1. Read Luke 24: 1-8. What was the angels message? What should the women have remembered?

    请阅读路加福音24:1-8。天使传达了什么信息？那些妇女们应当记起什么？

2. Read Luke 24: 9-12 What was the disciples reaction? What did Peter do?

    请阅读路加福音24:9-12，门徒们做出了什么反应？彼得做了什么？

3. Read Luke 24: 19-24 These sad disciples were walking to a little village, 7 miles from Jerusalem. Jesus came beside them , suddenly. He pretended He didn’t know about the death on the crosses. What did the disciples tell Him?

    请阅读路加福音24:19-24 这些难过的门徒正走向一个小村庄，离耶路撒冷约有7英里。耶稣突然来到他们身边。祂假装不知道十字架上的受难。门徒们对祂说了什么？

4. Read Luke 24: 25-27. Why did Jesus explain the Scriptures to them? (He wanted them to understand why He came to this earth and died. He wanted them to understand that He really rose from the dead.)

    请阅读路加福音24:25-27。耶稣为神向他们解释圣经？(祂希望他们能明白祂为什么来到世界上并受死。祂希望他们能明白祂真的从死里复活了)

5. Read Luke 24: 28-33. How were these disciples feeling now?

    请阅读路加福音24:28-33。这些门徒现在感觉如何？

6. Read Luke 24: 36-43. It was evening. The Emmaus disciples and the others were discussing all that had happened that day. Jesus is just as patient with us, when we do not understand all that he has done for us. What were the first words of Jesus to his frightened disciples?

    请阅读路加福音24:36-43。那时已经晚了。以马忤斯路上的门徒们正在讨论在那天发生了什么事。在我们还不明白耶稣为我们所做的事之时，祂如此耐心的陪伴我们。耶稣对那些惊慌害怕的门徒们所说的第一句话是什么？

7. Read Luke 24: 44-49. Where was Jesus’ life on earth prophecied? (The Scriptures, Moses and the Prophets, the Psalms.) What was written about Jesus? (See verses 46-47) What are witnesses? (People who have actually seen what has happened.) What has the Father promised? (Power from the Holy Spirit.)

    请阅读路加福音24:44-49. 耶稣在地上的生活在哪些地方被预言的？（圣经，摩西的律法和先知书，诗篇）圣经对耶稣有哪些预言（参考46-47节）什么是见证？（实际看到事情发生经过的人）父所应许是什么？（从圣灵而来的能力）

##### Relationships-What is the result of love, forgiveness, respect, and prayer? 关系-爱、赦免、尊重和祷告的结果是什么？

1. We have talked about God’s love and forgiveness . We have talked about the wonderful example God gives in listening, serving, respecting each other. Let’s talk about trust. What is trust? ( Trust is faith that a person does and says what is best for you. Confidence is another word for trust.)

    我们已经讲过神的爱和赦免。我们也讲到了神所给我们的去聆听、服事、彼此尊重的美好榜样。现在让我们来谈谈倚靠。什么是倚靠？（倚靠是相信人所做所讲的是为了你的好处。信任是倚靠的同义词。）

2. Does God always say what is best for us? Does He always do what is best for us? O Lord, you alone are my hope, I’ve trusted you…from childhood. Proverbs 3:5 We can always trust God.
    
    神是否总是讲为我们好的话？神是否总是做为我们好的事？主—耶和华啊，你是我所盼望的； 从我年幼，你是我所倚靠的。诗篇71:5 我们可以一直倚靠神。

3. People who are given love, forgiveness, and respect will trust. We will trust those who treat us the same. It is important for us to love, forgive, and respect our parents. We want them to trust us!

    爱人、原谅人、尊重人的人会赢得倚靠。我们会倚靠那些如此对待我们的人。爱、原谅和赦免我们的父母是非常重要的。我们希望他们能够倚靠我们。

4. Our trust is not perfect, because we are not perfect. Did the disciples have perfect trust in Jesus? Did they use their own understanding? Repentance and forgiveness removes imperfect trust. God’s trust is perfect. We can trust Him always. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, do not depend on your own understanding. Psalms 118:8

    我们的倚靠是不完全的，因为我们自己是不完全的。门徒们对耶稣有完全的倚靠吗？他们是否靠赖自己的理解？悔改和赦免除去了不完全的倚靠。神的倚靠是完全的。我们可以一直倚靠祂。你要专心仰赖耶和华， 不可倚靠自己的聪明。箴言3:5

Prayer: Heavenly Father, Jesus is alive. Christ is arisen! We praise You, we glorify You. We honor You for giving us Jesus to save us! Thank you for our faith and for our Risen Lord! And for our Heavenly Home! In Jesus’ name. Amen

祷告：天父，耶稣活着，基督已复活！我们赞美你，我们称颂你。我们尊荣你，因你赐给我们耶稣来救赎我们。为我们的信心和我们复活的主而感谢你！并为我们天家而感谢你！奉耶稣的名求。阿门
