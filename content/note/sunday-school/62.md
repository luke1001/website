**GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US.  神拯救我们的慈爱计划：**

In the first verses of Matthew 14, we read that Herod, the king put  John  in prison and had him  killed. Later he heard about Jesus and the loving miracles he did to heal the sick and suffering.  Herod thought that Jesus was John the Baptist. He thought John was alive again.  Herod’s thoughts and deeds caused Jesus to want to go to a quiet place to pray to   His Father. 
    在马太福音14章 第一节，我们读了希律王将约翰下在监狱，将他处死。后来他听到关于耶稣的消息以及他行神迹医治病人和受难。希律王认为耶稣就是施洗约翰。他认为约翰又活了。希律王的想法和行为使耶稣想去一个安静的地方向天父祷告。

The story of the feeding of 5000 people is recorded in all  four Gospels- Matthew, Mark, Luke , and John. John reports  that the crowd wanted to crown Jesus as their king after He fed them. But Jesus knew their thoughts. He dismissed the people disappeared, again, alone to pray. Satan was using the people to convince Jesus to become an earthly king, and give up His job to save the world.
    喂饱5000人的故事在四部福音书——马太福音，马可福音，路加福音，约翰福音中都有记载。约翰记载了群众在耶稣喂饱他们后想给耶稣加冕做他们的王。但耶稣知道他们的想法。他解散他们，消失，再次独自祷告。撒旦在利用人说服耶稣当世上的王，放弃他拯救世人的使命。

Jesus was very popular with the people. They followed Him wherever He went . Jesus and the disciples used their fishing boat to get away from the crowds and have time together. There was so much Jesus needed to teach His disciples! Watch how He teaches them that He is True God in our lesson for today.
    耶稣很受人们欢迎。无论耶稣到哪里他们都跟随他。耶稣和他的门徒用渔船与众人隔开，有时间相聚。耶稣有太多的东西要教导门徒！在我们今天的功课中注意他怎样教导他们他就是真神。
