**GOD’S LOVING PLAN TO SAVE US: 神拯救我们的慈爱计划：**

Jesus is teaching us how happy all of heaven is when one person repents of sins and asks Jesus to forgive him or her.  He is teaching with parables. Parables are stories about earthy happenings with heavenly meanings. 

耶稣在教导我们当一个人为罪悔改，求耶稣赦免他或她的罪时，整个天国都欢喜。他在用比喻教导我们。比喻是包含属天意义的属世的故事。

Jesus teaches 3 parables in Luke 15. The are called “lost and found” parables because in teach story something is lost and found again. The heavenly meaning in each parable tells us about the joy of God and the angels when one person who had lost his/her faith repents of their sins and believes in Jesus as their Savior again. 

耶稣在路加福音15章讲了3个比喻。这些被称为“失而复得” 的比喻，因为在每一个故事中，有一样东西失而复得。每一个比喻中的属天意义告诉我们当失去信心的人为罪悔改并相信耶稣为他们的救主时，神和天使都为此欢喜。

The Pharisees and  teachers of the Jewish law did not believe that Jesus was their Savior. They were proud people. They stayed away from people who did not keep the laws they had made. They thought they would go to heaven because they were better than others in keeping the laws of the Old Testament.

法利赛人和犹太教的律法师不相信耶稣是他们的救主。他们都是骄傲的人。他们远离那些不遵守他们制定的律法的人。他们认为他们将进天国，因为他们比其他人更好地遵行旧约律法。

We are all sinners because we do not keep God’s command to love Him and everyone perfectly. But in this lesson “sinners” refers to  people who did not keep the Pharisees’ laws. Tax collectors were called “sinners” because people thought that they stole money from people when they collected taxes by charging too much.  

我们都是罪人，因为我们没有遵守神要我们完全爱他和爱所有人的诫命。本课中“罪人”指那些没有遵行法利赛人的律法的人。税吏被称为“罪人”，因为人们认为他们高额征税，偷窃百姓的钱财。
