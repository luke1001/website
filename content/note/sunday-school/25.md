##### Let’s think about the opportunities God gives us, while we study Moses and the opportunity God gave him. 在学习关于摩西和神给他机会的过程中，让我们思考神给我们的机会。

God Prepares His People for a Savior to be born. He wants all people to know Him as a loving God. He is not simply an invisible force. He is our Father. He gave us His promise of a Savior to save all people from eternal death. The Jewish people were reminded of this Promise as they retold the stories of their history. God is getting ready to remind His people again of who He is and what He is doing. The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will be their leader. Moses and Aaron will be God’s mouthpiece.

神为他的子民预备一位救主降生。他要所有百姓知道他是一位活神。他不只是一个无形的力量。他是我们的父。他给我们救主的应许，为了拯救所有人脱离永远的死亡。当犹太人复述他们的历史故事时就想起神的应许。神准备再次提醒他的子民他是谁以及他的作为。亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各的神将是他们的领袖。摩西和亚伦将是神话语的出口。

Who is the God of Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob?

亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各的神是谁？

**I AM WHO I AM.** With this name, God is telling us that He is independent, His wisdom and will are not attached to anyone else.

**I AM WHO I AM.** With this name God is telling us that He is constant. He does not think one way on one day and another way on another day. In Malachi 13:8, He says, “I, the Lord, do not change. “

**I AM WHO I AM.** In Revelations 1:8 God tells us,” I am the Alpha and the Omega….who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.” Our God is eternal, from everlasting to everlasting. 

God gives us leaders to remind us who He is. Who are they?

God’s actions were and are driven by His great love for us-“God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son…” John 3:16

我是自有永有。神的这个名字告诉我们他是完全独立的，他的智慧和意志不依附于任何人。

我是自有永有。神的这个名字告诉我们他决不改变。他不会一天一个想法。玛拉基书3:6他说，“我 ─ 耶 和 华 是 不 改 变 的 .”

我是自有永有。在启示录1:8 神告诉我们，“ 我 是 阿 拉 法 ， 我 是 俄 梅 戛 ， 是 昔 在 、 今 在 、 以 後 永 在 的 全 能 者 。”我们的神是永恒的，从亘古到永远。

神用领袖提醒我们他是谁？这些领袖是谁？

神的行为因他对我们的大爱驱使—— “神 爱 世 人 ， 甚 至 将 他 的 独 生 子 赐 给 他 们 ， 叫 一 切 信 他 的 ， 不 至 灭 亡 ， 反 得 永 生 。约翰福音3:16

**God’s Loving Plan to Save Us**- The Children of Israel (the Jewish nation) were in Egypt 400 years after Joseph and his family moved there. God had a plan for His people. They were living in a foreign land, a land where their neighbors did not know our True God.

**神拯救我们的爱的计划**——在约瑟和他的家人迁移到埃及后， 以色列子民（犹太民族）在那里生活了400年。神对他的子民有一个计划。他们居住在异国他乡，而那里的居民不认识我们的真神。

You will remember that the Israelites in Egypt feared God (Exodus 1:17). They knew of God’s promise to send a Savior. His people were brought to faith in Him just like we are brought to faith. The promise of the Savior was repeated over and over.

你会记得在埃及的以色列民敬畏神（出埃及记1:17).他们知道神差遣一位救主的应许。他的子民被带领相信神的过程正如我们今天一样。救主的应许不断地被重复。

Moses knew about the Savior to come when he saw the burning bush. How did God remind Moses of His power in this incident?

当摩西看到燃烧的荆棘时知道救主要到来。在这个事件中神怎样提醒摩西他的大能?

When Moses came to lead them and said “I AM WHO I AM”, the Israelites knew who Moses was talking about. They knew their God was eternal, powerful, and had promised they would live in a land” flowing with milk and honey.” But more, God had promised them life eternal in heaven.

当摩西去带领以色列民时说“我是自有永有，”以色列民知道摩西说的是谁。他们知道他们的神是永恒的，有大能的，并应许他们会住在“流奶与蜜之地。”不仅如此，神应许他们天国的永生。
