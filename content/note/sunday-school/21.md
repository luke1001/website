**Opening Prayer :** Psalm 84

**Memory verse:** Revelation 21:3

**记忆经句：** 启示录21:3

The tabernacle and temple of the Old Testament were a shadow or a hint of the reality of God living with us in a closer way was yet to come! Think of threads in a piece of fabric that run from one end to the other. There are threads in the Bible of themes that start at creation and end in heaven! One of these themes is the tabernacle and temple and the truth of God living with us.

旧约时代神的会幕和圣殿是对神将到来的本体更亲近地住在我们中间的预示或隐射！想象一块布里面从一头绕到另一头的线。而圣经的主题脉络就是从创世纪开始，结束于天国！其中的一个主题就是神的会幕和圣殿，以及神与我们同住的真理。

Stephen talks about the temple in the Old Testament and then connects it to the temple in heaven!

司提反讲到旧约的圣殿，然后把它和天国的圣殿联系起来！
