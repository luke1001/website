##### Jesus is our King! 耶稣是我们的王

1. Jesus and His disciples were nearing Jerusalem 6 days before His death.

    在耶稣被钉十字架之前的第6天，他和他的门徒当时在耶路撒冷附近。

2. Jesus’ ride into Jerusalem was foretold in Zechariah 9:9: Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt , the foal of a donkey.

    “ Daughter of Zion” means Jerusalem and its people. “ King” = ruler of heaven and earth. ”Gentle” = humble. Foal= young donkey under a year old. A donkey was a lowly animal of peace in Jesus ‘ time . But King David used the donkey as his royal mount.

    撒迦利亚 9：9预言了耶稣骑着驴进耶路撒冷：锡安的民哪，应当大大喜乐。耶路撒冷的民哪，应当欢呼。看哪，你的王来到你这里。他是公义的，并且施行拯救，谦谦和和地骑着驴，就是骑着驴的驹子。

    “锡安的民”指耶路撒冷和它的百姓。“王”=天地的掌管者。“谦谦和和”=谦卑。驴驹=不到一岁的小驴。在耶稣的时代，驴是低微平和的动物。但大卫王将驴作为他的御驾。

3. Read Luke 19:28-34. How did Jesus tell his disciples to obtain a colt (young donkey) for him to ride? (The disciples were to enter a village, and find a colt tied. They were to untie it and tell the owners , “ The Lord needs it.”

    阅读路加福音19：28-34。耶稣如何告诉他的门徒们去牵一匹驴驹来让他骑？（门徒们将去一个村庄，找到一匹栓着的驴驹。他们将它解开，告诉主人说，“主要用它。”）

4. What was special about this colt? (No one had ever ridden it.)

    这匹驴驹有何特别之处？（从来没有人骑过）

5. What was amazing about this method of finding a colt to ride on? ( Jesus knew where to find the colt, and the owners were willing to let the disciples take it. Notice that the disciples did not ask to use it. This was another show of Jesus’ all-knowing power. )

    这样找到所骑的驴驹有什么稀奇之处？（耶稣知道到哪里找驴驹，驴驹的主人也愿意让门徒们牵走。注意门徒们没有谁说要骑驴。这又一次表明了耶稣全知的能力。）

6. Read Luke 19: 35-40. How did the disciples prepare the colt for Jesus?( They put their cloaks on it and set Jesus on it. A cloak is a large cloth people wore over their other clothing.)

    阅读路加福音19：35-40。门徒们如何为耶稣预备好驴驹？（他们把自己的衣服搭在上面，扶着耶稣骑上）

7. How did the people respond to Jesus? ( They spread their cloaks on the ground and made a path for Jesus to ride over. They joyfully praised God for all of the miracles they had seen. Matthew 21: 8 tells us that people also cut palm branches from the trees and spread them on the road.)

    人们对耶稣的反应是怎样的？（他们把衣服铺在路上让耶稣骑着驴驹通过。他们因所见过的一切异能，都大声赞美神。马太福音21：8告诉我们人们也砍下棕榈树枝来铺在路上。）

8. The words the people chanted are also found in Psalm 118:26. They were part of the readings at the Passover celebration.

    人们呼喊的话语在记载于诗篇118：26。这些话语是逾越节庆典经文阅读的一部分。

9. The Pharisees did not like what all of the followers of Jesus were doing. What did they ask Jesus to do? (The Pharisees wanted Jesus to tell the people to stop praising Him.)

    法利赛人不喜欢跟从耶稣的人所作的事。他们要求耶稣作什么？（法利赛人要耶稣告诉人们停止赞美他。）

10. What was Jesus’ answer? ( If the people are quiet, the stones will cry out in praise. ) This was Jesus’ day of celebration before His death.

    耶稣如何回答？（若是他们闭口不说，这些石头必要呼叫起来。）这是耶稣死前的欢庆之日。

##### Relationships – God disciplines us because He loves us. 关系 – 上帝因为爱我们而管教我们

1. What is discipline? (Discipline is training that improves our mental and moral behavior. Notice the word “disciple” in “discipline”. Discipline is training followers.

    什么是管教？（管教就是训练我们以改善我们的精神和道德上的行为。注意英文“管教”一词里包含了“门徒”的概念。管教就是训练跟从的人。）

2. Part of discipline may include punishment. Punishment is sometimes necessary to train people. Times of discipline and rebuke are not our happy memories. One example, death comes to all people because of sin. Death at the end of life is our punishment from God for our sins.

    惩罚是管教的一部分。要训练人们，惩罚有时是必要的。管教和指责不是开心的记忆。举个例子，因为罪，死亡临到所有的人。在我们生命终结时的死亡是从神而来的对我们罪的惩罚。

3. God disciplines and allows sad and difficult times for us to keep us from hurting ourselves or to strengthen faith. He does not want sin and Satan to cause us to lose our faith. In Hebrews 12:5-11 God calls us His children!! “My child,[b] don’t make light of the Lord’s discipline,    and don’t give up when he corrects you .For the Lord disciplines those he loves,    and he punishes each one he accepts as his child.

    神管教我们，允许让我们有悲惨和困难的时刻，为了要保守我们不去伤害自己，或者为了要坚固我们的信心。他并不想要罪和撒但来使我们失去信心。在希伯来书12：5-11他称我们为他的儿女。“我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候，也不可灰心。 因为主所爱的他必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。”

4. What should our loving response be to God’s discipline? In Revelation 3:19 He says, “I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference. ( God asks us to repent and not to become negatively disinterested in our faith or in Him.)

    我们如何以爱心回应神的管教？在启示录3：19他说，“凡我所疼爱的，我就责备管教他。所以你要发热心，也要悔改。”（神叫我们要悔改，不要对我们的信心或是对他漠不关心。）

5. God wants parents to discipline their children with love. Being a parent is a very big responsibility. It is not always easy to make good decisions for our children. Parents pray very often for their children. They think about what they need to teach them. Christian parents know that training their children to love God and obey Him is their biggest job. Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord. Ephesians 6:4

    神要父母用爱心管教他们的孩子。做父母是一份很大的责任。总是为我们的孩子做最好的决定并不容易。父母们常常为他们的孩子祷告。他们思想将什么教导给他们的孩子。基督徒父母们知道将他们的孩子训练成去爱神，顺服神是他们最大的工作。以弗所书 6：4你们作父亲的，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒，养育他们。

6. Where do parents receive their instructions about how to raise children? (Parents need to study the Bible, and listen to what Jesus says about children.)Direct your children onto the right path,    and when they are older, they will not leave it .Proverbs 22;6

    父母们从哪里得到教训去教养他们的孩子？（父母们需要学习圣经，聆听耶稣如何讲论小孩子。）箴言22：6 教养孩童，使他走当行的道，就是到老他也不偏离。

7. What should our loving response be to our parent’s discipline? Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. “Honor your father and your mother. “ Ephesians 6:1 &2.

    我们如何以爱心回应我们父母的管教？ 以弗所书6：1-2你们作儿女的，要在主里听从父母，这是理所当然的。要孝敬父母，使你们得福，在世长寿。

Prayer: We celebrate with your disciples, Jesus. Blessed are You, our King. You bring peace to our lives and we thank you. As you disciplined your disciples, so give our parents the love and wisdom to train us to walk with You. We honor them as we honor you. Help us, Jesus. Amen.

祷告：耶稣，我们与你的门徒们一起欢庆。你，我们的王是有福的。你带给我们生命，我们感谢你。正如你管教你的门徒，求你也赐给我们父母爱和智慧来训练我们与你同行。我们尊敬他们，像我们尊敬你一样。耶稣，请帮助我们。阿门。

##### HOMEWORK: 家庭作业:

    复习圣经词语：小马，小驴驹，激怒，管教，门徒，和散那

2. Memorize this important verse: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest! Matthew 21:9

    记住这节重要的经文：和散那归于大卫的子孙，（和散那原有求救的意思，在此乃称颂的话）奉主名来的，是应当称颂的。高高在上和散那。马太福音 21：9

3. Review:“The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost. Luke 19:10”

    复习：“人子来，为要寻找拯救失丧的人。路加福音19：10”

4. Read Luke 23:26-38 for June 7. This is the story of Jesus’ death.

    预习六月7号将要学习的路加福音23：26-38。这记载了耶稣的死。

God had promised a Savior to Adam and Eve.

God promised a Savior to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and to David.

God promised a Savior to Mary and her cousin Elizabeth.

God promised a Savior (Jesus) to us and to all people so we would not die eternally because of our sin.

God kept His promise. He sent His Son Jesus to be born in a stable.

God was pleased with Jesus, His Son. He showed us that Jesus is God with the Father and Holy Spirit.

Jesus served God’s people by teaching them about God. He gave them faith to believe in Him as he healed people and raised them from the dead.

We are in the Kingdom of God when the Holy Spirit gives us faith to believe in Him. Zaccheus and the children received this love from Jesus, also.

Jesus was celebrated one week before His resurrection. He led a parade. He was greeted as the King. He IS the King of Heaven.

上帝向亚当和夏娃应许了一位救主

上帝向亚伯拉罕，以赛亚，雅各，和大卫应许了一位救主

上帝向马利亚和她的堂姐以利沙伯应许了一位救主

上帝向所有人应许了一位救主以致我们不会因为我们的罪而永远地死去

上帝信守他的应许。他派耶稣来为我们的罪而死

上帝喜悦耶稣，他的儿子。他向我们显明耶稣是神，与圣父和圣灵在一起。

耶稣藉着教导人们有关神的事情而服事人们。当他治好人的病，将他们从死里救活时，他赐给人们信心去相信他。

当圣灵赐给我们信心去信神时，我们就在神的国里。撒该和小孩子们也从耶稣那里得到了这样的爱。阿门。

在他复活的前一个星期，人们欢呼耶稣。有许多人跟着他。以国王的尊容待他。他是天国的王。。

God’s love is for everyone. Let’s sing Amazing Grace:

上帝愛所有的人，让我们来唱奇异恩典：

Amazing grace-how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch* like me!

I once was lost but now am found,

Was blind but now I see.

奇異恩典，何等甘甜。

我罪已得赦免！

前我失丧，今被寻回。

瞎眼今得看见。

* wretch=very bad and unhappy person

    可怜之人=很坏且不快乐的人

God loves us so much. Jesus is waiting for us in heaven. I am excited to study with you again next Saturday.

Remember, Jesus love you.

Grandma Barbara

上帝非常爱我们。耶稣在天堂等我们。我非常高兴和你们在周六一起学习。

记得，耶稣爱你。
