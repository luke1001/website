1. 读使徒行传15:36-16:40（并回答下面的问题）

2. 读腓立比书(整卷书)并回答问题
 
##### Introduction:  导言：

Most of Acts 15 is the record of the great council meeting at Jerusalem (which took place after the first missionary journey to the Gentile world in about A.D. 49. The council was called because some of the Jerusalem Christians were concerned that the Gentiles were being allowed into the Christian movement without being circumcised and required to obey all of the laws of Moses. So the congregation at Jerusalem invited the congregation at Antioch to send representatives down to discuss and resolve this issue. The issue was actually more than just circumcision, but whether salvation is by faith in Christor faith in Christ and obedience to the laws of Moses. 

使徒行传15章主要是紀載那个重要的耶路撒冷会议 (这是在公元49年第一次到外邦传教之后所举行的会议)。這个会议的召開是因为耶路撒冷的一些基督徒担心外邦人沒有受割礼也沒有遵守摩西的所有律法就被允许參加基督教运动。耶路撒冷的教会请安提阿的教会派代表来讨论并解决这个问题。这个问题实际上不仅仅是割礼，而是救恩是否是只憑着信，或者是靠信仰基督及遵守摩西的律法而得到。

The meeting was fruitful and resulted in agreement that the Gentiles would not have to be circumcised in order to be full-fledged members of the Christian Church. The apostles at Jerusalem wrote a letter encouraging the new Gentile converts to avoid eating meat that was not prepared in accord to Jewish laws (because such meat would make it difficult for the Jewish believers to share a meal with the Gentile believers) and avoid sexual relationships that would be offensive to the Jewish believers. 

这次会议取得了丰硕成果，并且达成协议，即外邦人成为基督教会的正式成员不必受割礼。耶路撒冷的使徒写了一封信，鼓励外邦人的皈依者避免吃不符合犹太律法所準備的肉食(因为这种肉食会使犹太信徒难以与他们共享) 外邦人信徒也应避免与人發生那种會冒犯犹太信徒的性关系。

What a blessing to have that resolved! Now mission work among the Gentiles could resume in full confidence that the new Gentile believers would share in the full rights of membership in the Christian community through faith in Christ Jesus. 

这个問題的解决是多么大的祝福啊！现在，对外邦人的传教工作可以很有信心的恢复，因为新加入的外邦信徒只要是真心信主穌就能完全成为基督徒群体中的一员。

######  READ ACTS 15:36-41 (TWO MISSION TEAMS FORM)  读使徒行传 15：36-41（成立了两个宣教团队）

A disagreement on whether to take John Mark along on a second mission trip led to the formation of two mission teams. 

因是否应让马可参加第二次的宣教有了意见分歧，这导至两个宣教团队的成立。

Mission Team # 1: Barnabas took his cousin John Mark and returned to the island of Cyprus (his homeland) to do mission work. This is the last that we hear of Barnabas, one of the Lord’s most important evangelists in the early Church. Mark later worked with Peter (1 Peter 5:13) and wrote one of the four gospels. 

第一个宣教团队：巴拿巴带他的表弟马可，回到居 比 路 岛(他的家鄉)去做宣传的工作。这是我们最后一次听到有关巴拿巴的消息，他是早期教会中最重要的传道人之一。马可后来和彼得一起同工(彼前05：13)，并写了四福音中的一書。

Mission Team # 2: Paul chose Silas as his new mission companion. Silas was a great choice. He was one of the leaders of the congregation at Jerusalem (Acts 15:22), a prophet (Acts 15:32), and both a Jew and a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37). So this new mission team consisted of a leader and prophet from the congregation at Antioch and from the congregation at Jerusalem, both Roman citizens and committed to the Gospel of salvation through faith in Christ. Paul and Silas would be gone for over three years, and this 2nd mission trip would expand even into southern Europe for the first time. 

第二个宣教团队：保罗选择西拉作为他的宣教伙伴。西拉是个很好的选择。他是耶路撒冷教会的领导人之一 (使徒行传15:22)，也是一位先知 (使徒行传15：32)，他又俱有犹太人和罗马公民的双重身份 (使徒行传16：37)。所以这个团队的成員一个是安提阿教会的领袖和先知, 另一个是耶路撒冷教会的领袖和先知，他們兩人都是罗马公民，都委身于靠信耶穌而得拯救的福音。保罗和西拉一去就是三年，这第二次的宣教甚致首次扩展到欧洲南部。
 
###### READ ACTS 16:1-5 (TIMOTHY IS ADDED TO THE MISSION TEAM)  读使徒行传 16：1-5（提摩太加入宣教团队）

The mission team headed north by land to Cilicia (Paul’s homeland) and then continued west to places that had been visited on the 1st mission journey. They came to Lystra where Paul had healed a cripple and where the mission team had experienced persecution. There they added a young Christian named Timothy to the mission team. Timothy would become Paul’s trusted colleague for the next 15 years, deeply committed to the mission of Christ and the welfare of the Christian churches all over Asia and Europe. 

這个宣教团队走陆路向北去到了基 利 家（保罗的家乡），然后继续向西前往第一次宣教期间走过的地方。 他们来到路司得，在那里保罗曾经治愈了一个跛子，在那裡他們也曾遭受了迫害。 在路司得，这个宣教团体加进一位名叫提摩太的年轻基督徒。 提摩太後來成为保罗在未来15年最信赖的同工，全然委身于基督的使命和整个亚洲和欧洲基督教会的福祉。

We learn from the New Testament that Timothy was relatively young (1 Tim. 4:12), prone to frequent illness (1 Tim. 5:23), and somewhat shy (2 Tim. 1:7-8). Yet, in spite of those things, Timothy was a great addition to the mission effort. Give some reasons why Timothy was a blessing to this mission work. (see the references below for reasons) 

从新约中我们知到提摩太很年轻（提前4:12），容易发病（提前5:23），又有些害羞（提前1：7-8）。 然而，尽管有这些问題，提摩太的加入还是大大加强了宣教事工。 你能找出一些原因耒为什么提摩太成為这次宣傳教事工的祝福。 （请参阅下面幾節經文）

Acts 16:1 – 使徒行传 16：1

Acts 16:2 – 使徒行传 16：2

1 Timothy 4:14 – 提摩太前书4:14 

1 Timothy 6:12 – 提摩太前书6:12

2 Timothy 3:14-15 – 提摩太後书3：14-15

2 Timothy 2:2 – 提摩太後书2：2
   
###### READ ACTS 16:6-10 (THE MISSION TEAM REACHES MACEDONIA)  读使徒行传16章6至10節 (宣教团隊到了马其顿)

See the map above in order to trace the route of the mission team’s travels as they headed west. We note two things in this section: 

1) The Holy Spirit was guiding the mission team to the places the Lord had in mind

2) Luke (the author of Acts) must have joined them somewhere because the account changes from “they” in v. 8 to “we” in v. 10. 

由上面的地图尋著宣教团队往西行进的路线，我们注意到两件事:

1)是圣灵在引导宣教团队前往主想的地方。

2)路加(使徒行传的作者)一定是在某处加入了他们，因为聖經的記載从第八節的“他们”到了第十節就変成了“我们”。

###### READ ACTS 16:11-40 (MISSION WORK IN PHILIPPI, MACEDONIA)  读使徒行传16章11至40 節 (腓立比和马其顿的宣教)

Led by the Holy Spirit, the mission team arrives in Philippi, “a leading city of that district.” Philippi was founded in B.C. 356 by Philip of Macedon (the father of Alexander the Great). It was a gold mining town on a major east-west trade route (the Via Egnatia). As a city of commerce, with many people traveling through, it was a wonderful place to take the Gospel. There must not have been many Jewish people there because on the Sabbath day Paul and the others did not go to a synagogue (there must be at least 10 Jews to form a synagogue) but to a place of prayer by the Gangites River. There they met Lydia, a business woman with a generous heart. How did Lydia become a Christian according to this section?

在圣灵的带领下，宣教团隊到达了腓立比。这是“那个地方的一个主要城市”。腓立比是在西元前356年由马其顿人腓立比所建立的 (他是亚历山大大帝的父亲)。这是一座位于主要东西方贸易路线上的金矿城 (这个路线也就是著名的伊那提安大路)。因为它是一个商业城市，有很多旅人耒往，是一个傳播福音的好地方。 在那里应该沒有太多犹太人，因为在安息日，保罗和其他人没有去犹太會堂（必须有至少10个犹太人才能建犹太會堂），而是到了江孜河辺的祷告之地。 在那里，他们遇见了呂底亞，一个有慷慨之心的女商人。 根据这一段經文，請描述呂底亞如何成为基督徒？

Why did it bother Paul that the fortune-telling servant girl was shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God who are telling you the way to be saved”? Wasn’t that a good thing? See also Luke 4:33-34,41. 

會算命的女仆在喊：“这些人是至高神的仆人，他們要告诉你得救之道”，这不是件好事吗？為什么保羅卻心中厌烦？参考路加福音 4：33-34，41

While in the Philippian prison, Paul and Silas prayed and sang hymns. Perhaps it was this experience in the Philippian prison that helped Paul years later when he was imprisoned again for the faith. Read Philippians 4:4-7. How did Paul and Silas practice this in the Philippian prison?  

在腓立比的监狱里，保罗和西拉祷告并唱诗赞美神。 在多年之後当他再次因信仰而被监禁时，腓立比监狱的经历也许使保罗得帮助。 读腓立比书4：4-7。 保罗和西拉在腓立比的监狱里怎么操练祷告及唱赞美诗呢？

When the jailor asked what he had to do to be saved, what was the simple answer? 

当禁卒问他要做什么才能得救的时候，简单的答案是什么？
 
##### PHILIPPIANS  腓立比书

During the years A.D.62-64 the apostle Paul was under house arrest in Rome while he awaited trial. During that time, he was allowed to receive visitors. One of those visitors was a man named Epaphroditus, a Christian man from the Philippian church. He had been sent by the Philippian Christians to bring Paul a generous gift from them, and to spend some time helping him in any way possible (see Philippians 2:25). 

在公元62到64年间，使徒保罗在罗马等待审判期间被软禁。在那段时间里，他被允许接待访客。其中一个访客是叫以巴弗提的一位男子，他是腓立比教會的基督徒, 他被腓立比教会派来送给保罗一份慷慨的礼物，并花一段时间尽力帮助他(請看腓立比書2：25)。

Unfortunately, while he was with Paul in Rome, Epaphroditus became gravely ill and almost died (2:27). The Philippians had heard of this and were very concerned about their Christian brother. By God’s grace, he recovered, and Paul was now anxious to have him return to Philippi to put the congregation at ease about him. When he returned, he would take an epistle from Paul back with him – the letter to the Philippians. 

不幸的是，当以巴弗提与保罗在罗马时，他病得很重，几乎死了（2:27）。 腓立比人听到了这消息，非常挂念他们的主内弟兄。他因着神的恩典痊愈了，保罗现在急切地想让巴弗提回到腓立比去，使那边教会的人能安心。当他回到腓立比时，他会带着保罗的書信和他一起回去-這也就是腓立比書。

In our reading of Acts 16, we heard how the congregation at Philippi began during the 2nd missionary journey in about A.D. 50.

使徒行传16 章告訴我们腓立比的教会是在保羅第二次宣教之旅,大約是公元50年开始的。

###### PURPOSE OF THE LETTER  腓立比書的目的

Paul had three reasons for sending this epistle. They are:

- Thank them for their concern and generous gifts 

- Report on his imprisonment

- Encourage them to stand united in faith and against false teachers

保罗寫这封信有三个理由。 他们是：

- 感谢他们的关心和慷慨的礼物

- 报告他被监禁的狀況

- 鼓励他们在信仰上团结一心，抵抗虚假教师

An excerpt from a letter to the Philippians by Polycarp of Smyrna (120-140AD):

Neither I nor anyone else can live up to the wisdom of the blessed and glorified Paul. When he was among you, he accurately and consistently taught the word of truth in front of those who were living then. When he was away from you, he wrote you a letter. If you study that letter, you will find it to be the way to build you up in the faith you have been given, which—when it is followed by hope and preceded by love towards God, Christ, and our neighbor—is the mother of us all. 

士每那的坡旅甲写给腓立比人的一封信的摘录(公元120-140年)：

你我都無法达到那受神祝福和得神荣光的保罗的智慧。当他与你們们同在的时候，他准确一贯地向那些当时活着的人教导真理。当他离开的时候，他给你们写了一封信。如果你研讀那封信，你会发现它是在堅固你所给予的信心,这个信心是因愛神,愛基督和愛我們的邻居而產生, 信心又产生盼望。这信心是我们众人的母亲。
 
###### READ PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 1  读腓立比書第1章

Then answer the following questions:

Being kept under house arrest, unable to travel, and facing an uncertain future that might end up in his own execution, we might expect to read in this letter that Paul was just trying to cope and survive. We might expect to hear expressions of self-pity or discouragement. But instead of a pessimistic tone, this epistle is very upbeat and joyful. 

然后回答以下问题：

由于保罗被软禁，无法旅行，面对一个不确定的未来，而且可能最後会被处决，我们可能以為保罗這封信只是会講他如何试图应付現況和求生存。我们可能以為会看到自怜或沮丧的字眼。然而相反的是，这封信不僅不悲观，而是充滿了乐观和快乐的语气。

What were some of the things that were causing Paul to be joyful and optimistic in spite of his circumstances?


什庅原因导致保罗尽管處境如此之差还能保持乐观和喜乐？

1:5 = ____________________

1:12-14 = ____________________

1:21 = ____________________

1:25 = ____________________

###### READ PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 2  读腓立比書第二章

Then answer the following questions:

Paul had already stated that he was joyful that the Gospel was being proclaimed in spite of persecution and opposition. Now, he says that his joy would be even more complete if the Christians at Philippi would respond to the Gospel in their daily lives. What are some of the things that he mentions as a Christian expression of faith?

然后回答以下问题：

保罗曾经说过，尽管受到迫害和反对，他很高兴福音照樣被傳揚開耒。现在，他说，如果腓立比的基督徒在日常生活中能杷福音活出來，他的喜悦就会更加完全。在他所提到东西裡有那些是基督教用來表达他們的信仰的？

2:2 = ____________________

2:3 = ____________________

2:4 = ____________________

In Luke 18:14 Jesus said, “Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” How was his own life an example of that truth?

在路加福音18:14中，耶稣说：“凡自高的，必降為卑，自卑的必升為高。” 耶穌自己的生命是怎样成为这个真理的典范的?

How do we “work out our salvation with fear and trembling”? (2:12)

我们如何“用恐惧和战兢耒作成我们得救的工夫”？
 
###### READ PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 3  读腓立比書第3章

Then answer the following questions:

In this chapter Paul mentions the false teachers who put confidence in their own efforts and obedience to the commands of Moses. In his early days, before Christ, Paul was one of them. What did Paul say about himself and all his accomplishments now? (3:7-8) 

然后回答以下问题：

在本章中，保罗提到那些把信心放在自己的努力和遵守摩西律法上的假教师。 在他遇見耶蘇之前，保罗自己也是這樣的假教师。 現在的保罗是如何評价自己和他以前的所有的成就？（3：7-8）

What kind of righteousness did Paul now want? (3:9)
