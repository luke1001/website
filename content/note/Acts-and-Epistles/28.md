#### Acts 27-28 and Colossians and Philemon 使徒行传27-28章，歌罗西书和腓利门书

The following homework assignment is to be completed prior to the next class. It is critical that you complete this homework assignment so that you are prepared, and ready to participate in the next lesson. This homework assignment will consist of two parts: 

下面的作业需要在下节课上课之前完成。完成这个作业非常重要，它可以帮助你做好准备参加下一课的学习。这个作业包括两部分:

1.Read Acts 27-28 (and answer the questions below)

2.Read Colossians & Philemon and answer the questions indicated

1.读使徒行传27-28章，(并回答后面的问题)；

2.读歌罗西书与腓利门书，并回答指定的问题；


##### Introduction: 介绍：

Paul and his companions had been in Caesarea for quite some time, awaiting hearings in front of the Roman governor. Paul had the opportunity to confess his faith before Governor Festus as well as the Judean king, Agrippa II. Now, in accord with the Lord’s word, Paul would have the opportunity to spread the Gospel in Rome. Chapter 27 of Acts records the first portion of a long and dangerous voyage from Caesarea to Rome. 

保罗和他的同伴们在凯撒利亚待了相当长的一段时间，在罗马总督面前等候听证。保罗有机会在非斯都总督和犹太国王亚基帕二世面前承认自己的信仰。现在，正如神给他的指示，保罗有机会在罗马传播福音。《使徒行传》第27章记录了从凯撒利亚到罗马的漫长而危险的航程的第一部分。

Paul was an experienced traveler, and he had sailed many times in the Mediterranean. In 2 Corinthians 11:25 he mentioned some of his experiences on the sea: “Three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea.” From the many times he writes “we” in chapter 27, we can tell that Luke was with Paul on this journey. Luke also notes that Aristarchus, one of the delegates that had accompanied the Gentile’s offering to Jerusalem, was on the ship with them. 

保罗是个经验丰富的旅行者，他曾多次在地中海航行。在哥林多前书第11章25节，他提到了他在海上的一些经历：“我遭遇了三次海难，在公海上度过了一天一夜。”从他在第27章所写的“我们”的次数中，可以看出路加在这段旅程中和保罗在一起。路加还写道，亚里达古是一起陪同往耶路撒冷送捐献的代表之一，也与他们同在船上。

The map below will help us trace the path of that voyage in these last chapters of Acts. 
 
上面的地图可以帮助我们在使徒行传的最后几章中找到那次航行的路径。



##### READ ACTS 27 (A LONG AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY)  读使徒行传第27章(一段漫长而危险的旅程)

Then answer the following question:

然后回答以下问题:

In v. 9 we read that it was already “after the Fast” which means that it was after the Jewish Day of Atonement, which occurs about the beginning of October. It was quite late in the year to be sailing, and Paul had warned the captain that the voyage could be dangerous. But the owner of the ship was determined to complete the voyage and make a profit from his cargo. As the ship and crew experienced hardships, Paul had the opportunity to confess his faith. What were some ways that Paul confessed his faith in this chapter? (As you answer, reflect on ways we can confess our faith in times of trouble.) 

在第9节中，我们读到，时间已经是“禁食之后”了，意思是那已经过了犹太人的赎罪日，即十月初的事。那是一年中出航较晚的时候了，而且保罗也警告过船长，这次航行可能会很危险。但是船主还是决定要完成这次航行，使他能从运载的货物中获利。当船和船员遭遇困难时，保罗便有机会表明他的信仰。

1.保罗在这一章中用了哪些方法来宣告他的信仰?
(当你回答时，思考一下我们在困难时当如何表明自己的信仰。)

##### READ ACTS 28:1-15 (FROM MALTA TO ROME)  读使徒行传28:1-15(从马耳他到罗马)

Then answer the following question:

然后回答以下问题:

The ship carrying Paul and his companions finally beached on the small island of Malta, about 60 miles south of Sicily. The fierce storm had driven them for several weeks a distance of about 500 miles. They were exhausted, stressed, wet and cold. But the people of Malta treated everyone kindly. On the island, a number of miracles involving Paul occurred. The reason for the miracles is not stated in the reading itself, but read Mark 16:18-20 -- “they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.” …  Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.”  What was the purpose for these miracles?

船载着保罗和他的同伴，最后在距西西里岛以南约60英里的马耳他小岛搁浅。这场猛烈的风暴使他们在几周内行驶了大约500英里。他们筋疲力尽，紧张，又湿又冷。但是马耳他人民对每个人都很友好。在岛上，发生了好几个与保罗有关的神迹。这些神迹的原因并没有在文中直接阐明，但在读马可福音16:18-20时---“手能拿蛇;若喝了什么毒物，也必不受害；手按病人，病人就必好了。”门徒出去，到处传扬福音。“主和他们同工，用神迹随着，证实所传的道。”

2.这些神迹的目的是什么?

##### READ ACTS 28:16-31 (PAUL SHARES THE GOSPEL IN ROME)  阅读使徒行传28:16-31(保罗在罗马分享福音)

Then answer the following question:

然后回答以下问题:

Finally, Paul reaches Rome, the most important city in the world of his day. His “imprisonment” in Rome was basically a house arrest. He was not placed into a dungeon, but allowed to live by himself in a rented house with a soldier guarding him. After getting settled in, the first thing he does is to arrange for a meeting with the leaders of the Jewish community in Rome. Why did Paul want to meet with them?

最后，保罗到达罗马，是当时世界上最重要的城市。他在罗马的监禁基本上是软禁。他没有被关进地牢，而是被允许独自住在一所租来的房子里，一个士兵看守着他。安顿下来后，他做的第一件事就是安排与罗马犹太地区的领袖会面。

3.保罗为什么要见他们?



#### COLOSSIANS 歌罗西书
Colossae was a city located in the Roman province of Asia (modern Turkey). It was near Laodicea (to which one of the seven letters of Revelation was written) on the Lycus River. For many years it was a prosperous trade city, located on a major trade route. But the city was demolished by earthquakes, and after a new trade route was developed, the city declined greatly. The city does not exist today, and there are very few ruins. One Bible scholar commented that Colossae was “the least important town to which Paul ever wrote.”

歌罗西是一个位于罗马省(现代土耳其)的城市。在老底嘉的旁边(《启示录》的七封书信中有一封是写给他们的)。多年来，它是一个繁荣的贸易城市，位于一条主要的贸易路线上。但是，这座城市被地震摧毁了，在一条新的贸易路线被开发之后，这座城市大大衰败了。这个城市今天已不复存在，几乎没有什么遗迹。一位圣经学者评论说，在保罗给他们写信的所有城镇中，歌罗西是最不重要的一个。

The apostle Paul never visited Colossae, and had probably never personally met many of the Christians there (cf. 2:1). Thus the Colossian congregation was not founded by Paul himself. So how did the church come to be there? In Acts 19:10 we read that Paul was preaching the Gospel in Ephesus and “this went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.” It was probably at this time that the congregations at Colossae and Laodicea were formed. We are told in Colossians 1:7 that “You learned it [the Gospel] from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf.” Thus the congregation may have been founded by Epaphras (little else is known about him). 

使徒保罗从来没有访问过歌罗西，而且可能从来没有在那里亲自遇到过许多基督徒(参 2:1)。因此可以说，歌罗西教会并不是由保罗亲自建立的。那么，那里的教会是怎么来的呢？在徒19：10中我们读到保罗在以弗所传福音，“这样有二年之久，所以住在亚西亚的犹太人和希利尼人，都听见了耶和华的话。”很可能是在这个时候，产生了歌罗西和老底嘉的教会。我们在歌罗西书1:7中被告知，“ 你 们 从 我 们 所 亲 爱 、 一 同 作 仆 人 的 以 巴 弗 所 学 的 。 他 为 我 们 （ 有 古 卷 ： 你 们 ） 作 了 基 督 忠 心 的 执 事 ”。因此，教会可能是由以巴弗建立的(对他了解甚少)。

The Colossian congregation had some well-known members. One of them was Onesimus, the runaway slave, about whom the letter to Philemon was written. (see 4:9 “Onesimus…is one of you.” Also, the congregation probably met in the home of Philemon, as we learn in Philemon 2.

歌罗西教会有一些著名的成员。他们当中有一个人是逃跑的奴隶阿尼西姆，就是腓利门书所谈的人。(见4:9阿尼西姆是你们中的一员。”而且，教会可能在腓利门的家中聚会，正如我们在腓利门书第2章中所了解的。

Paul wrote this epistle during his years of house arrest in Rome (Acts 28:30) in about AD 61-63. We can tell this from his comment in Colossians 4:3 – “I am in chains”. This letter was written about the same time as the epistle to Philemon. 

在公元61-63年，保罗在罗马的软禁期间写了这封信(使徒行传28:30)。我们可以从他在《歌罗西书》第4章3节—“我 为 此 被 捆 锁”的评论中得知这一点。这封信与给腓利门的书信写作大约在同一时间。

##### The Colossian Heresy 歌罗西的异端

The reason for the letter was a visit from Epaphras, a member of the church, and most likely its founding pastor. In spite of the many good things about the congregation, there was a problem. The Christians there were being influenced by a false teaching. Let’s see if we can identify the characteristics of that false teaching from hints found in the letter itself. Look up the following verses and jot down some characteristics of the false teaching that Paul was opposing. 	

写这封信的起因是以巴弗的到访。他是教会的一名成员，而且很有可能是建立教会的牧者。尽管教会有许多优点，但还是有一个问题。那里的基督徒受到了异端邪说的影响。让我们看看我们是否能从信中发现的线索中找出异端教导的内容。查一下下面的经文，写下保罗所反对的异端教导的一些特点。

- 2:4  

- 2:8  

- 2:16  

- 2:18  

- 2:20-23   

##### PURPOSE OF THE LETTER 这封信的目的

Paul had three purposes in writing this epistle: 

保罗写这封信有三个目的:

1. To encourage the Christians in their faith and Christian love

    鼓励基督徒持守信心并活出基督之爱

2. To proclaim the truth so that they would not be deceived by false teachers

    宣讲真理，使他们不被假教师欺骗

3. To inform the Colossians about the situation that Paul and his companions were in 

    通知歌罗西教会的信徒有关保罗和他的同伴的处境

##### Read COLOSSIANS 1 阅读《歌罗西书》第1章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答下列问题:

1. What were Paul and Timothy thanking the Lord for in regard to the Colossian Christians?

    保罗和提摩太为歌罗西基督徒的哪些方面感谢主？

    v.12  

    v.13  

    v.14  

    Has the Lord done the same things for you that He did for the Colossians? Yes, He has. The more we reflect upon these blessings, the more we realize how great our salvation is, and how much we have in Christ. We also realize that our salvation is accomplished, and there is nothing more that needs to be done. 

    主为歌罗西信徒所做的事情，也同样为你做了吗? 是的，他也做了。我们越多地反思这些祝福，就越能意识到我们的救赎有多伟大，我们在基督里拥有多少。我们也认识到我们的救赎已经完成，不需要再做更多的事情让我们得救。

2. In verses 15-20 the apostle lists some amazing facts about Jesus, reminding us how unique and great Jesus is. What are those amazing facts about our beautiful Savior that He reviews:

    在第15-20节，使徒列举了一些关于耶稣的惊人事实，提醒我们耶稣是多么的独特和伟大。他提到了哪些有关我们美妙救主令人震惊的事实？

- v.15a  

- v.15b  

- v.16  

- v.17  

- v.18a  

- v.18b  

- v.19  

- v.20  

##### Read COLOSSIANS 2 读《歌罗西书》第2章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答以下问题:

1. In verse 8 Paul writes: “See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.” What are some “hollow and deceptive philosophies” which are based on human traditions that trouble us today?

    在第8节，保罗写道：“你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 恐 怕 有 人 用 他 的 理 学 和 虚 空 的 妄 言 ， 不 照 着 基 督 ， 乃 照 人 间 的 遗 传 和 世 上 的 小 学 就 把 你 们 掳 去 。” 今天有哪些来自人的传统的“空洞而又骗人的哲学”在困扰我们?




2. Put verse 9 in your own words. 

    把第9节用你自己的话写出来。


 
##### Read COLOSSIANS 3 读歌罗西书第3章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答以下问题:

1. In verses 5-14 Paul contrasts the difference that being a Christian makes in our lives every day. He contrasts the “old self with its practices” (the way an unbeliever lives) and the “new self, which is being renewed in the image of its Creator” (the way the believer lives). Using words and phrases from these verses, fill in the chart below with descriptions of the “old self” and the “new self”.

    在第5-14节，保罗对比了一个基督徒每天在生活中能够产生出的不同。他对比了“旧 人 和 旧 人 的 行 为”(不信主的人所有的生活方式)和“新 人， 这 新 人 在 知 识 上 渐 渐 更 新 ， 正 如 造 他 主 的 形 像” (信徒的生活方式) 。使用这些 经文中的词和短语，填入下面的图表，描述旧人和新人的不同。

    |  OLD SELF (The Unbeliever)<br />旧人，老我（不信的人）  |  NEW SELF (Believer)<br />新人（信徒）  |
    |  -----  |  -----  |
    |         |         |



    
2. It’s not surprising that in verses 22 to 4:1 the apostle addresses the relationships between slaves and their masters. After all, this letter was being accompanied by Onesimus, who had run away from his master Philemon (see the notes on Philemon and Onesimus below). The Bible never actually condemns slavery, but regulates it and requires that masters treat their slaves fairly. What can we learn about the duties of masters (employers) and slaves (employees) from this section?  

    在第22至4:1节中，使徒对奴隶与主人之间的关系的论述并不令人惊讶。毕竟，这封信的陪伴者是阿尼西姆，一个从他主人腓利门那里跑出来的奴隶 (见以下对腓利门和阿尼西姆的注释)。圣经并没有谴责奴隶制，而是规范奴隶制，要求奴隶主公平地对待他们的奴隶。我们能从这一部分了解到主人(雇主)和奴隶(雇员)的职责吗?



##### Read COLOSSIANS 4 读《歌罗西书》第4章

Then answer the following question: 

然后回答以下问题:

1. In these final instructions, Paul is encouraging the Colossians to share their faith with “outsiders” (those who are not part of the Christian community, v.5). He encourages the Colossian Christians to do two things toward the outsiders (unbelievers) in v.5-6. What are they?

    在这些最后的指示中，保罗鼓励歌罗西信徒与“外来者”(那些不是基督教团体的人，第五节)分享他们的信仰。在第5-6节中，他鼓励歌罗西基督徒向外来者(不信的人)做两件事。它们是什么？



2. Verse 6 is not easy to understand. It says: “Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.” That sentence raises a few questions such as: 

    第6节并不容易理解。它说：“你 们 的 言 语 要 常 常 带 着 和 气 ， 好 像 用 盐 调 和 ， 就 可 知 道 该 怎 样 回 答 各 人 。”这句话引出了一些问题，比如:

    a.What is meant by “conversation”? and how can it be “full of grace”? 

    a. “言语/对话”  是什么意思？以及怎样才能“常常带着和气/满有恩典”?

    b.What does it mean to have conversation seasoned with salt?

    b.   言语好像用盐调和是什么意思?

First, we notice that this verse is in the context of our speech and behavior around “outsiders” (unbelievers). We are told in verse 5 to be wise in the way we act toward them, making every opportunity to share our faith with them. In that context, our “conversation” with outsiders is not just talking about the weather and news, but it will include the sharing of the Gospel. So when our conversations with outsiders turn to the sharing of our faith, our words must be “full of grace”, which means that we are to focus on God’s grace toward us (more than God’s laws). In other words, instead of focusing on what we are supposed to be doing (the law), our witness will focus especially on what God has done for us (the Gospel). Then Paul mentions seasoning our conversation with salt. Salt makes food tasty and appealing. 

首先，我们注意到这节经文的上下文说的是我们在与周围的“外邦人”（不信主的人） 说话做事的方面。在第5节中，我们被告知，要以智慧与他们相处，利用一切机会与他们分享我们的信仰。在这种情况下，我们与外邦人的“对话”不仅仅是谈论天气和新闻，还包括传扬福音。因此，当我们与外邦人的谈话谈到与他们分享我们的信仰时，我们的话语必须充满恩典，这意味着我们将焦点放在神对我们的恩典上(超过他对我们的律法要求)。换句话说，我们的见证要特别将焦点放在神为我们做的事情（福音）上，而是将焦点放在我们应该做的事情(律法)上。然后保罗提到我们的言语要像被盐调和过。盐使食物美味可口。

A Christian’s talk is to be appealing and appropriate, not berating and brow-beating. Paul had already written: “You must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips” (Colossians 3:8). In the letter to the Ephesians Paul wrote: “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen” (Ephesians 4:29). 

一个基督徒说话要有吸引力，要说得合适，而不是斥责和殴打。保罗已经写过：“但 现 在 你 们 要 弃 绝 这 一 切 的 事 ， 以 及 恼 恨 、 忿 怒 、 恶 毒 （ 或 作 ： 阴 毒 ） 、 毁 谤 ， 并 口 中 污 秽 的 言 语 。” (歌罗西书3:8)。在给以弗所教会的信中，保罗写道：“污 秽 的 言 语 一 句 不 可 出 口 ， 只 要 随 事 说 造 就 人 的 好 话 ， 叫 听 见 的 人 得 益 处 。” (以弗所书4:29)。”

There was a time when the concept of “salty speech” referred to the terminology that was used by sailors who sailed the oceans (salt water). Eventually, “salty speech” came to refer to language that is sprinkled with crude, four-letter words. But here the concept means just the opposite. As salt is used to make food more appealing, let’s converse with others with sincerity, tact, and respectfulness, so that nothing we say (or do) may stand in the way of the Gospel. This rules out all profanity, gossip, arrogance, negativity, etc. 

曾经有一段时间，“带盐味的话”这个词被用来指航海(咸水海)的水手。最后，“带盐味的话”就开始指那种夹杂粗俗、低俗字眼的语言。但这里的概念却恰恰相反。当盐被用来使食物更美味时，让我们用真诚、机智和尊重来与人交谈，这样我们说的(或做的)就不会妨碍福音的传播。这也排除了所有的亵渎、八卦、傲慢、消极等话语。

When we talk about making the message of the gospel “more palatable,” the idea is not that we can improve on the Gospel, which already tastes sweeter than honey, but that we behave and speak in such a way that we do not detract from the message of Christ, as we pray in the 1st petition of the Lord’s Prayer, or as Paul wrote to Titus (2:10) – “[Teach slaves to] show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive” (Titus 2:10). 

当我们谈到要让福音的信息“更美味”时，意思并不是说我们可以改进福音，因为它的味道已经比蜜更甜，而是我们的行为和说话方式我们不偏离基督的信息,正如我们在主祷文所求的第一点，或者像保罗写给提多的话(2:10)—要[教导奴隶] “不 可 私 拿 东 西 ； 要 显 为 忠 诚 ， 以 致 凡 事 尊 荣 我 们 救 主 神 的 道 。” (提多书2:10)。

May our speech be as appealing as food properly seasoned. In an excellent Bible Class series (“They Like Jesus, But Not the Church”), author Dan Kimball relates how Christians sometimes close down potential conversations with unbelievers by arrogant, insensitive, crude and disrespectful comments about women, homosexuals, and other religions. How can we share the saving Gospel with these people, if we speak with ignorance, disrespect or disdain about them or their ideas? 

但愿我们的言语能像食物一样被调和得具有吸引力。在一本优秀的《圣经》系列课中(“他们喜欢耶稣，而不是教会”)，作者丹·金伯尔(Dan Kimball)讲述了基督徒在与不信主的人谈话时，有时在谈到女性、同性恋和其他宗教时，会因为使用傲慢、不敏感、粗鲁和不尊重的言词而使谈话搁浅。如果我们对他们或他们的想法使用无知、不尊重或蔑视的言辞，怎么能给他们分享福音救恩的信息呢?

And whenever we engage in conversation with a friend or with a stranger, we Christians want to be careful in our language, avoiding gossip, slander, negativity, mocking words, cursing, and bitterness. Epaphras had delivered the “full gospel” to the Colossians, but now neither he nor Paul could be there in person to help evangelize the neighborhood. Now that the Colossian Christians knew the Gospel, they must also know how to be good evangelists – to share the Message of Christ and respond to inquiries about it. So Paul writes: “… that you may know how to answer everyone.” 

每当我们与朋友或陌生人交谈时，我们基督徒都希望在我们的语言中小心谨慎，避免流言蜚语、诽谤、消极、嘲笑、诅咒和痛苦。以巴弗把“完整的福音”传给了歌罗西人，但现在他和保罗都不能亲自到那里帮忙传福音了。现在，歌罗西基督徒知道福音，他们也必须知道如何成为福音传道人，分享基督的讯息，并回应别人的询问。所以保罗写道:“使你们知道应该怎样回答每一个人。”

Whether we are responding to a question that someone might ask of us, or to an objection that someone might raise to the faith, we need to be ready share the message of Christ crucified with anyone who still does not know or believe.  The apostle Peter said something very similar in 1 Peter 3:15-16 – “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.” 


不管我们是在回答别人可能会问到的问题，还是有人可能会提出反对意见，我们都需要准备好与那些仍然不知道或不相信的人分享基督受难的信息。使徒彼得在彼得前书3:15-16中说了非常相似的话：“只 要 心 里 尊 主 基 督 为 圣 。 有 人 问 你 们 心 中 盼 望 的 缘 由 ， 就 要 常 作 准 备 ， 以 温 柔 、 敬 畏 的 心 回 答 各 人 ； 16存 着 无 亏 的 良 心 ， 叫 你 们 在 何 事 上 被 毁 谤 ， 就 在 何 事 上 可 以 叫 那 诬 赖 你 们 在 基 督 里 有 好 品 行 的 人 自 觉 羞 愧 。” 




#### PHILEMON 腓利门书

##### PHILEMON 腓利门

The epistle to Philemon is the shortest of Paul’s epistles (just a single chapter of 25 verses), and a bit different in that it was written about a somewhat private matter, the fate of a man named Onesimus, a runaway slave. 

《腓利门书》是保罗书信中最短的一卷(仅有一章，共25节内容)，与其它书信不同的一点是，它的内容更私人化，有关一个叫阿尼西姆的人的命运，一个脱逃的奴隶。

The man named Philemon is not mentioned anywhere else in the New Testament except in this epistle. Apparently he lived in Colosse. Paul must have known him well because he addresses him as “our dear friend and fellow worker.” From this we gather that he must have been a Christian (perhaps coming to faith through Paul’s ministry) who probably was a companion of Paul on one of the mission trips. 

这个名叫腓利门的人除了在这封书信中提到之外，新约没有其它地方提到。显然他住在歌罗西。保罗一定很了解他，因为他称呼他为我们亲爱的朋友和同工。从这里我们可以看出，他一定是一个基督徒(也许是通过保罗传福音信主的)，他可能是保罗一次布道旅行的同伴。

Philemon was also a slave owner. And that fact, in addition to the fact that the Colossian congregation met in his home (“to the church that meets in your home” – v.2) suggests that he may have been somewhat wealthy.

腓利门也是一个奴隶主。除了歌罗西教会在他的家中聚会(“ 在 你 家 的 教 会”—v2 )这一事实之外，他可能是已经有些富有的人。

##### ONESIMUS 阿尼西姆

Onesimus was a slave who belonged to Philemon. At some point Onesimus had run off, ending up in Rome, where Paul was under house arrest. In Rome he came into contact with Paul and was converted to Christianity. Paul writes that Onesimus “became my son while I was in chains” (v. 10). See also v. 16. 

阿尼西姆是腓利门的奴隶。在某个时候，阿尼西姆逃跑了，最后到了罗马，就是保罗被软禁的地方。在罗马，他与保罗接触并皈依基督教。保罗论到阿尼西姆时写道，“就 是 为 我 在 捆 锁 中 所 生 的 儿 子 阿 尼 西 母 （ 就 是 有 益 处 的 意 思 ） 求 你 。” (第10节)。也参第16节。

After converting to Christianity, Onesimus became a useful companion of Paul. In fact the name Onesimus means “useful, worthwhile.” 

归信基督之后，阿尼西姆成为了保罗的得力助手。事实上，阿尼西姆这个名字的意思就是：“有用，有价值”。

##### Read PHILEMON 读腓利门书

Then answer the following questions:

并回答以下问题：

1. What is the reason for Paul’s letter to Philemon? (see verses 10 and 17) 

    保罗给腓利门的写信的原因是什么? (见第10节和第17节) 



2. Paul is urging Philemon to forgive Onesimus for running away. What motivation does Paul offer Philemon for forgiving this runaway slave? 

    保罗正在敦促腓利门原谅阿尼西姆逃跑的行为。保罗在请求腓利门宽恕这个逃跑的奴隶时，带着怎样的动机? 

    v. 9 	

    v. 11	

    v. 18-19  


    The outcome of this story is never told in the Bible. However, there is an interesting historical document that may shed light on what happened. About 50 years after Paul wrote the letter to Philemon, a Christian named Ignatius was being taken to Rome to be executed. Along the way at Smyrna, Ignatius wrote a letter to the Christian church at Ephesus. In this letter he praised the wonderful bishop (older pastor) at Ephesus, whose name was Onesimus. Could this be the same Onesimus, now an old man, and a beloved pastor of the Ephesian church? If so, then his life is a testimony to the change that Christ can make.

    这个故事的结局在《圣经》中从未被提及。然而，有一份有趣的历史文献可能会揭示发生的事情。在保罗给腓利门写了信之后约50年的时间，一个名叫伊格内修斯的基督徒被带到罗马处死。在士麦那的路上，伊格内修斯写了一封信给以弗所的基督教会。在这封信中，他称赞了以弗所的一位了不起的主教(年长的牧者)，他的名字叫阿尼西姆。这会不会就是那同一个阿尼西姆呢？当时已经是一个老人，一个受以弗所教会爱戴的牧者?如果是这样，那么他的生命就是基督所做的改变见证。
