下面的课后作业需要在下节课上课之前完成。完成这个作业非常重要，它可以帮助你做好准备参加下一课的学习。这个作业包括两部分:

1.Read Acts 24-26 (and answer the questions below)

2.Read 2 Timothy & Titus and answer the questions indicated

1.读使徒行传24-26章，(并回答后面的问题)；

2.读提摩太后书与提多书，并回答指定的问题。

##### Introduction: 介绍

In our previous lesson we learned that when Paul reached Jerusalem at the end of the third journey, some of the Jews from the province of Asia began a riot that nearly resulted in Paul being killed. The Romans put him into custody, confused about the uproar. In the process, the Romans discovered that Paul was a Roman citizen, and the commander in Jerusalem, to protect Paul from a Jewish conspiracy to kill him, and in order that Paul might receive a fair trial, transferred him to Caesarea to the court of Felix, the Roman governor of Judea. There Paul was kept in custody as he awaited his hearing. 

在上节课中，我们得知，当保罗在第三次旅程结束到达耶路撒冷时，一些来自亚洲地区的犹太人发动了一场暴动，差点导致保罗被杀。罗马人对骚动感到困惑，于是把他拘留起来。在这个过程中，罗马人发现保罗是一个罗马公民；后来，耶路撒冷的指挥官为了保护保罗不被犹太人阴谋杀害，使他有可能得到公正的审判，于是把他转到了该撒利亚菲利斯的衙门，犹大地的罗马长官。保罗被拘留在那里等候听审。

##### READ ACTS 24 (PAUL TESTIFIES TO FELIX)  读使徒行传24章（保罗向 腓力斯作证）

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下列问题：

1. What were the charges against Paul? 

    对保罗的指控是什么？

2. What was the Christian faith called in v.5 and in v. 14? 

    基督信仰在第5节和第14节中被称为什么？

    v.5 – 


    v.14 – 

3. What did Paul say was the real issue that upset the Jews?

    保罗说让犹太人不安的真正问题是什么？



##### READ ACTS 25:1-22 (PAUL TESTIFIES TO FESTUS)  读使徒行传25:1-22 （保罗向 腓斯都作见证）

Even though more than 2 years had passed since the initial riot in Jerusalem, the Jewish leaders there were just as determined as ever to put Paul to death. Does their hatred know no limits? So a second trial is held in Caesarea. The goal of the Jewish leaders was to get Paul returned to Jerusalem so that he could be killed. 

尽管最初在耶路撒冷的暴乱已经过去两年多了，但犹太领袖还是一如既往地坚决要处死保罗。他们的仇恨没有节制吗?第二次审判在凯撒利亚举行。犹太领袖的目标是让保罗回到耶路撒冷，这样他们就可以杀了他。

1. Why did Paul appeal to Caesar, even though he was obviously innocent? 

    尽管保罗显然是无辜的，他为什么还要向凯撒上诉?




##### READ ACTS 25:23-26:32 (PAUL TESTIFIES TO AGRIPPA)  读使徒行传25:23-26:32 （保罗向亚基帕王作见证）

Then answer the following question:

然后回答下列问题：

The King Agrippa mentioned here is King Herod Agrippa II, the great-grandson of Herod the Great (who tried to kill Jesus) and the son of Herod Agrippa I (who killed the apostle James). Bernice was his sister. Felix was his brother-in-law. Herod Agrippa II was the last of the Herods to rule in Judea. 

这里提到的亚基帕王指的是希律王亚基帕二世，是大希律王的曾孙(曾试图杀害耶稣)希律·亚基帕一世的儿子(他杀了使徒雅各)。柏妮丝是他的妹妹，腓力斯是他的妹夫。希律·亚基帕二世是最后一个统治犹大地的人。

As Paul spoke his defense, Festus concluded that he must be insane to talk about someone rising from the dead. However, Paul kept on emphasizing that Agrippa himself was “well acquainted” (26:3) and “familiar” (26:26) with what had happened in Judea. (Recall that Agrippa’s father, Herod Agrippa I, was the one who had killed James, imprisoned Peter, and died a sudden and horrible death because he would not give glory to God - see 12:1-23). Why is it important that everything that Paul was talking about, and all the events in the life of Jesus, were public knowledge, and not “things done in a corner” (26:26)? 

当保罗为自己辩护时，非斯都得出结论说，他一定是疯了，才说有人会从死里复活。然而，保罗一再强调，亚基帕本人很了解(26:3)，而且熟悉(26:26)曾在犹大地发生的事情。(回忆亚基帕的父亲，希律亚基帕一世，就是那个曾杀害雅各、囚禁彼得，后来因为他不肯将荣耀归给神而突然死得极其可怕的那一位。见12:1-23)。保罗所说的一切，以及耶稣生活中的所有事件，都是众人皆知的事情，而不是“发生在角落里”的事情(26:26 )。 为什么这一点很重要？

#### 2 TIMOTHY 提摩太后书

2 Timothy is probably the last epistle written by Paul. The date is about AD 65 or 66. He is in a dark, cold dungeon somewhere in Rome. He is apart from his friends, facing a probable execution, and concerned about the future of the church, especially the  congregation at Ephesus. He wrote this epistle to Timothy for three reasons:

提摩太后书可能是保罗的最后书信。日期大约是公元65年或66年。那时他在罗马的某个黑暗冰冷的地牢里。这是他第二次入狱。在第一次监禁期间，他遭到软禁，并获得了一定程度的自由。但现在，他可能已经进入了罗马的监牢，面临死刑。他远离他的朋友们，独自面对将要临到的处决，但心里却关心着教会的未来，尤其是以弗所的会众。他给提摩太写这封信有三个原因：

1. to pass on to Timothy the ministry he would have to leave behind

    他要把将要留下来的事工任务转交给提摩太；

2. to urge Timothy to oppose false doctrines

    让提摩太反对错误的教义；

3. to ask Timothy to come to visit him as soon as possible

    让提摩太尽快来看望他。

##### TIMOTHY 提摩太

Timothy had been Paul’s trusted co-worker for the past 15 years. He had collaborated in the writing of six epistles (1 & 2 Thessalonians; 2 Corinthians; Philippians; Colossians; and Philemon), and he was Paul’s trusted representative on four missions (to Thessalonica, Philippi, Corinth, and Ephesus). 

在过去的15年里，提摩太一直是保罗信任的同工。他曾与保罗合作写过六封书信。帖撒罗尼迦前后书、哥林多后书、腓立比书、歌罗西书和腓利门书）。他是保罗四次旅行中所信任的代表（到帖撒罗尼迦，腓立比，哥林多，以弗所）。

Paul was concerned about the Christian church. Nero was bent on destroying it, and all Christians had been expelled from Rome. Many congregations needed guidance and instruction as they sought to work through the problems caused by sin. But Paul could not travel to any of them anymore. It was time to pass the torch to the best man he knew. 

保罗很关心基督教会。尼禄执意要摧毁它，把所有的基督徒都赶出罗马。许多教会在寻求解决由罪引起的问题方面，需要引导和指示。但保罗再也不能去任何地方旅行了，是时候把火炬传递给他所认识的最中意的人了。

There In verse 2, Paul calls Timothy “my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord.” This was probably because Paul had instructed him in the Gospel (see 1 Corinthians 4:15 – “Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.”) so that Timothy could eventually work beside him in the ministry of the Gospel. Now Paul is writing to him for the last time. 

在第2节中，保罗称提摩太为“我亲爱的儿子，在主里忠心的”。这可能是因为保罗教导过他有关福音的真理 (哥林多前书4:15“你 们 学 基 督 的 ， 师 傅 虽 有 一 万 ， 为 父 的 却 是 不 多 ， 因 我 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 用 福 音 生 了 你 们 。”)这样，提摩太就可以最终在福音事奉上与他同工。保罗现在是最后一次给他写信。

##### Read 2 TIMOTHY 1 读提摩太后书1章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下列问题：

1. In verse 6 Paul tells Timothy to “fan into flame the gift of God” and to be bold and fearless in sharing the Gospel and speaking the truth of God to others. Then in verses 7-8 Paul writes about two things that could keep Timothy (and us) from being bold in sharing the Gospel – “shame” (fear of embarrassment) and “timidity” (cowardice, fear of rejection). Are these still the two main things that keep us from boldly sharing our faith?  Let’s put the cards on the table. If these are two big fears we have, how can we overcome them? (see v.12 for ideas)  

    在第6节中，保罗告诉提摩太要把“神 的 恩 赐 再 如 火 挑 旺 起 来”，并要大胆无畏地分享福音，把神的真理告诉人。在第7-8节，保罗写了两件会让提摩太 (和我们)在分享福音时不敢放胆的事：一是为福音感到“耻辱”(害怕尴尬)；二是“胆怯”(胆怯，害怕被拒绝)。这两大点今天仍然是阻止我们勇敢分享信仰的主要因素吗?让我们摊开来说，如果今天这仍然是存在于我们内心的两大恐惧，我们应该怎样克服它们呢? (见第12节)






2. In verse 14 Paul tells us to “guard the good deposit that was entrusted” to us. The language he uses reminds us of depositing money in a bank account, trusting that it would be kept safe and gain interest. Jesus used this same concept in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). God has entrusted us with the gospel message (and its spread). How do we guard that message in such a way that it is kept safe and gains interest? (Read 1 Timothy 6:20 -- Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge” to start the discussion.) 

    在第14节中，保罗告诉我们要“保管好托付给我们的善款”。他所使用的语言让我们想到将钱存入银行的事，即我们相信它会安全地保存在那里，而且能获得利息。耶稣在有关恩赐的寓言中使用了同样的概念(马太福音25:14-30)。神把福音的信息(和传扬福音的使命)委托给我们。我们如何以一种安全的方式来保护信息并从中获益?
 (读提摩太前书6:20——“ 提 摩 太 啊 ， 你 要 保 守 所 托 付 你 的 ， 躲 避 世 俗 的 虚 谈 和 那 敌 真 道 、 似 是 而 非 的 学 问 。 21已 经 有 人 自 称 有 这 学 问 ， 就 偏 离 了 真 道 。 愿 恩 惠 常 与 你 们 同 在 ！”然后再讨论。) 





##### Read 2 TIMOTHY 2 读提摩太后书2章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下列问题：

1. In verse 8 Paul gives a brief summary of his gospel – the message that he was preaching and teaching. Compare this summary with Romans 1:3-4 – “Regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David, and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.”  What three things were at the heart of his gospel? 

    在第8节中，保罗对他的福音作了简短的总结——他正在传讲和教导的信息。对比保罗的总结与罗马书1:3-4的内容——“论 到 他 儿 子 ─ 我 主 耶 稣 基 督 。 按 肉 体 说 ， 是 从 大 卫 后 裔 生 的 ； 4按 圣 善 的 灵 说 ， 因 从 死 里 复 活 ， 以 大 能 显 明 是 神 的 儿 子” 。 哪三样东西是他所讲福音的核心？



2. If someone asked you to summarize the Christian faith (the gospel), what would you say? “This is my gospel …

    如果有人要你总结基督教信仰(福音)，你会怎么说? “我所讲的福音是这样------”


3. In this section the subject of false teaching comes up. In v. 17 two false teachers are mentioned by name – Hymenaeus and Philetus. (Hymenaeus is also mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:20 – “Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.” We know nothing more of Philetus.) Besides the false teaching Paul calls “blasphemy”, other things are mentioned such as “quarreling about words”  (v.14), “godless chatter” (v.16), and “foolish and stupid arguments” (v.23). Instead of such things, the apostle encourages all Christian pastors and teachers to “correctly handle the word of truth” (v.15) How does a Christian teacher do that? Can you give some examples? 

    在这部分中，假教导的主题出现了。在第17中，两个假教师的名字被提了出来：有 许 米 乃 和 腓 理 徒 。(提摩太前书1:20中也提到了许米乃，其中有许米乃和亚历山大，我已经将他们交给撒但，要教导他们不要说亵渎的话。我们对腓 理 徒一无所知。除了保罗所说的“渎神”之外，还提到其它事情，如为 言 语 争 辩 (v.14)、世 俗 的 虚 谈 (v.16)、无 学 问 的 辩 论 (v.23)。相反，使徒们鼓励所有基督徒牧师和老师“按 着 正 意 分 解 真 理 的 道” (15)。
一个基督教的教师怎样做到这一点?  你能举几个例子吗?





##### Read 2 TIMOTHY 3 读提摩太后书3章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下列问题：

1. Note on v. 8 = In this verse Paul mentions the traditional names given to the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses. (See Exodus 7:11,22; 8:7 for details.) Even though the Old Testament does not mention the names of the magicians, these were the names being used for those magicians at the time of Paul. 

    第8节经文注释：在这节经文中，保罗提到了那些反对摩西的埃及魔术师们常用的姓名。(见《出埃及记》7:11； 22；8:7可以看到细节) 。虽然旧约中没有提到那些术士的名字，但在保罗时期，这些名字就被用在那些术士身上。

2. In verses 1-9 Paul describes what people will be like in the last days.  Agree or disagree. Conditions in the world today are more horrible than they were in Paul’s day. 

    在第1-9节中，保罗描述了末后时代人表现出的情形。下面的说法你是否同意，当今世界的情形比保罗的时代更可怕？





3. In v. 16 Paul teaches the inspiration of the Scriptures, saying that they are “God-breathed.” In the Old Testament the Holy Spirit is called the “breath of the Almighty” (Job 33:4; see also John 20:22). This verse teaches us that all the Scriptures came to us through the Holy Spirit, and therefore we may know that they are the words of God. Then Paul writes that the Scriptures are useful for four things. Give a brief definition of each of the four purposes of the Bible: 

    在第16节，保罗教导了圣经的启示，说圣经是神所“默示的”。在旧约中，圣灵被称为“全能者的气息” (约伯33:4; 参见约翰20:22)。这节经文教导我们，所有的经文都是通过圣灵临到我们的，因此我们才可以知道他们是神的话语。然后保罗写到，圣经有四个方面的用处。对《圣经》的四个用途做简短解释：

Teaching =  教导 =

Rebuking =  督责 =

Correcting =  使人归正 =

Training in righteousness =  教导人学义 =

##### Read 2 TIMOTHY 4 读提摩太后书4章

Then answer the following question:

然后回答下列问题：

1. In verses 3-4 Paul writes that there will be pressure on Timothy (as a pastor) to tell people what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear. Write down a few things that people today WANT to hear, and then a few things that all people NEED to hear. 
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR

    在第3-4节中，保罗写到，提摩太(作为一个牧师)会感觉很想去告诉人们他们想听的东西，而不是他们需要听的东西。写出人们今天想听的事情，然后写出人们需要听的事情。
人们想听什么：







    WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR
    
    人们需要听什么：








#### TITUS 提多书

##### CRETE 克里特岛

The book of Acts ends with the apostle Paul under house arrest in Rome for two years. But apparently, Paul’s ministry did not end when the book of Acts ends. From hints in the New Testament epistles, and from the writings of some of the early Christians that came after Paul, it appears that Paul was released from house arrest in Rome about AD 63. Then, before being arrested and imprisoned a second time, Paul had another year or so to travel and preach the Gospel. 

《使徒行传》的结尾是使徒保罗在罗马被软禁的两年。但很显然，在使徒行传结束时，保罗的事工并没有结束。从新约书信的提示以及保罗之后的早期基督徒作品看，保罗似乎是在公元63年被从罗马的软禁中释放出来。然后，在又一次被逮捕和关押之前，保罗又有一年左右的时间去旅行布道。

One of the places that he traveled was the island of Crete, the fourth largest island of the Mediterranean. Crete lies directly south of the Aegean Sea (see note on 1Sa 30:14; cf. Paul’s experiences there in Ac 27:7–13). In NT times life in Crete had sunk to a deplorable moral level. The dishonesty, gluttony and laziness of its inhabitants were proverbial as we gather from Titus 1:12. 

他去过的其中一个地方是克里特岛，地中海的第四大岛屿。克里特位于爱琴海的南边(见注:撒上 30:14；对照徒27:7 —13中保罗在那里的经历)。在新约时代，克里特市的生活已经陷入了可悲的道德水平。我们从提多书1:12中看到，居民的不诚实、贪食和懒惰是众所周知的。

Apparently Paul introduced Christianity in Crete when he and Titus visited the island, after which he left Titus there to organize the converts. Paul sent the letter with Zenas and Apollos, who were on a journey that took them through Crete (3:13), to give Titus personal authorization and guidance in meeting opposition (1:5; 2:1, 7–8, 15; 3:9), instructions about faith and conduct, and warnings about false teachers. Paul also informed Titus of his future plans for him (3:12). The letter was written after his release from the first Roman imprisonment (Ac 28), probably between 63-65 AD. 


很显然，保罗在他和提多到达克里特岛时向他们介绍了基督教，之后他把提多留在那里牧养信徒。保罗让西纳和亚波罗送了这封信，因他们正要旅行经过克里特岛(多3:13)。他给提多个人授权，并教导他在遇到反对时该怎样应对， (多1:5；2:1,7— 8，15；3:9)，指示他有关信心和行为之间的关系，并警告他要防备假老师。保罗也将他对提多未来的期望告诉了他(多3:12)。这封信是在他第一次从罗马监狱(徒28)获释后写的，大概在公元63-65之间。

##### TITUS  提多

Titus is not mentioned in the book of Acts, but is mentioned 13 times in the rest of the NT. In Titus 1:4 Paul calls him “my true son in our common faith”, which typically would mean that Titus had come to faith through Paul’s ministry. From Galatians 2:1-3 we learn that Titus was a Greek (Gentile) who was not circumcised, but became a Christian and accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem after the first mission journey for a meeting with the leaders of the Jerusalem congregation. 

在《使徒行传》中没有提到提多的名字，但在《新约》的其余部分提到了13次。在提多书1:4，保罗称他为“照 着 我 们 共 信 之 道 作 我 真 儿 子 的”，这通常意味着提多是通过保罗的事奉信主的。从加拉太书2:1-3我们得知，提多是一个希腊人(非犹太人)，他没有受割礼，但后来成了基督徒，并在第一次布道旅行之后跟随保罗和巴拿巴前往耶路撒冷，与耶路撒冷教会的领袖会面。

From 2 Corinthians 8:23 we learn that Titus was Paul’s “partner and fellow worker.”
Titus must have become a part of the mission team on the second and/or third mission trips. Considering the assignments given him, he obviously was a capable and resourceful leader.

从哥林多后书8:23，我们知道提多是保罗的“我 的 同 伴 ， 一 同 为 你 们 劳 碌 的”。在第二和第三次旅行布道期间，提多一定已经成了布道团的成员。考虑到分派给他的任务，他显然是一个能干且足智多谋的领袖。

##### Read TITUS 1 读提多书1章

Then answer the following questions:

并回答下列问题：

1. What were the two reasons that Paul left Titus behind on Crete? (v.5)

    保罗把提多留在克里特岛的两个原因是什么?(第五节)


2. Paul acknowledges that Titus needs to be well-equipped to stand firm against opposition to the Gospel and his ministry on Crete. In verses 10-12 he characterizes the opponents of the Gospel. Then urges Titus to oppose them. How would Titus seek to win these people over and defend the truth?
   
    v. 13 	_________________________________
	
	v. 14	_________________________________

    保罗承认，提多需要装备精良，才能在抵挡福音的人面前坚定地站立，继续他在克里特的事奉。在第10-12节中，他描述了福音的敌对者，然后敦促提多对抗他们。提多是怎样得着赢得这些人的方法并捍卫真理的?
