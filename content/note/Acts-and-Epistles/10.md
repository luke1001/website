###### Introduction: 导言：

Although the apostle Paul is well-known for being the “apostle to the Gentiles”, the apostle Peter also was commissioned to proclaim Christ to the Gentiles. Last week we heard that Peter and John went to Samaria to share the Lord’s word in many towns and villages. Now, the Lord leads Peter to the home of a Gentile in the Roman town of Caesarea. 

虽然使徒保罗是著名的"外邦人的使徒"，使徒彼得也曾被差派向外邦人传讲耶稣。上星期我们听到彼得和约翰去撒马利亚的许多城镇和村庄分享主的话。现在，主带领彼得在该撒利亚一个罗马城的一个外邦人的家。
 
Caesarea was about 30 miles north of Joppa on the Mediterranean seacoast. The Roman occupation forces were headquartered there. At the end of Acts 8, we read that Philip (one of the seven deacons) “traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea” (Acts 8:40). Philip stayed in Caesarea for many years, raised a family, and eventually Paul stayed at his house at the end of the 3rd missionary journey (Acts 21:8 – “Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.”) 

该撒利亚在约帕北部大约 30 英里，在地中海沿岸。罗马占领军的中心设在这里。在使徒行传第八章的结束，我们读到腓利 （七执事之一）"走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到凯撒利亚"（使徒行传 8:40）。腓利住在凯撒利亚许多年，组建了家庭，最终保罗第 3 次宣教旅程末了住在他家里 (徒 21:8 — —"第二天，我们离开那里，来到凯撒利亚，就进了传福音的腓力家里，和他同住。他是那七个执事里的一个。")
 
At Caesarea the apostle Peter discovered that God’s saving grace was for all people, Jew and Gentile alike. God led Peter to the home of a Roman centurion, Cornelius. 

在凯撒利亚使徒彼得发现上帝拯救的恩典是给所有人的，对犹太人和外邦人是一样的。神带领彼得到罗马百夫长哥尼流的家。
 
###### READ ACTS 10:1-23 (CLEAN AND UNCLEAN) 请读使徒行传10：1-23， （洁净的和不洁净的）

Verse 15 contains the main lesson and Biblical principle God is teaching in this section. Put the truth of verse 15 in your own words below.

第十五节包含了神在这一部分所教导的主要功课和圣经原则。用你自己的话在下面写下第十五节的真理。
 
###### READ CHAPTER 10:24-48 (CONVERSION OF CORNELIUS) 读10:24-48 （哥尼流的皈依）

What did Peter do (Acts 10:23, 25) and say (Acts 10:28, 34-35) that showed that he understood the lesson that God was teaching with the sheet and unclean animals?

彼得作（徒 10:23，25）和说（使徒行传 10:28，34-35）了什么表明了他明白了神用一块布和不洁净动物所作的教导？

In v. 36 Peter began to proclaim the “good news of peace through Jesus Christ.” What were the main points of that good news (gospel) message?

##### The Epistle to the Romans 给罗马人的书信

​Cornelius was a Roman centurion and a Gentile, who heard the Gospel and came to faith with his entire household. His conversion to Christianity is a powerful illustration of the truth that God wants all people to be saved, and that God does not show favoritism to any race or nationality. Since Cornelius was a Roman who experienced the grace of God, it seems only natural for us to read the epistle to the Romans, which is a powerful declaration of God’s grace to all people.

哥尼流是罗马的百夫长，也是外邦人。他听到福音并和他的全家一起信了。他皈依基督教是一个强有力的例证 —上帝要让所有的人得救，神不偏待任何种族和国籍。因为哥尼流是一个经历了神恩典的罗马人，这样我们读这封给罗马人的书信是太自然不过了，因为它是神要把他的恩典给所有人的一个强有力的宣告。

​The epistles in the New Testament were not arranged chronologically, but by length and importance. For these reasons, Romans is the first epistle in our New Testament. Martin Luther said of Romans: “This epistle is really the chief book of the New Testament, and is truly the purest Gospel. It is worthy not only that every Christian should know it word for word, by heart, but also that he should occupy himself with it every day, as the daily bread of the soul.” (LW 35:365)

新约书信并不是按时间顺序安排的，而是按长度和重要性排列的。出于这些原因，罗马书是新约中的第一封书信。马丁 · 路德 在讲到罗马书时说:"这本书信真的是新约圣经最重要的一本书，并且确实是最纯粹的福音。它值得每个基督徒用心知道罗马书的每个词，而且每天读它，作为灵魂日用的饮食。"(LW 35:365)
 
  
###### THE AUTHOR 作者

​In the first verse of this epistle, Paul identifies himself as the writer. The entire epistle contains material that points to him as the writer, and no one has seriously questioned this fact.

在这封书信的第一节，保罗点明自己是作者。整个的书信包含的材料指明他是作者，无人质疑这一事实。

###### THE CITY OF ROME​ 罗马城

At the time of the New Testament, Rome was a huge city, with a population of over 1,000,000 people.  There were many slaves in this wealthy city.  There was also a Jewish quarter with an estimated population of 50,000.

在新约时代，罗马是一个大城，人口超过一百万。 在这个富裕的城市有很多的奴隶。也有一个约有五万人的犹太区。


###### THE CONGREGATION 教会

At the time of this epistle, the congregation consisted of both Jewish and Gentile converts. Paul had not yet been there himself, but he obviously knew some of the Christians there.

在写这封信的时候，教会包括犹太人和外邦人的皈依者。保罗尚未有到过那里，但他显然知道那里的一些基督徒。
 
Who founded the congregation and when? The Roman Catholic Church believes that Peter founded the congregation at Rome, and that he served as bishop of Rome for 25 years before his martyrdom there in about A.D. 65. There are many reasons why this cannot be so, including the fact that Claudius had expelled all of the Jews from Rome in A.D. 49 (Acts 18:2) and Paul never greeted Peter in his greetings at the end of Romans (which would be very odd if Peter was the bishop there).

谁建立了罗马教会？在什么时候？罗马天主教会认为彼得建立了罗马的教会，认为他担任罗马主教二十五年，然后他在公元 65 年左右在罗马殉难。但有很多原因使得这个说法不成立，其中包括革老丢在公元 49 （徒 18:2）驱逐所有在罗马的犹太人 和保罗没有在罗马书的末尾问候彼得 （，如果彼得是那里的主教，保罗不问候会是很奇怪的事）。

If Peter did not found the congregation at Rome, who did?  Probably the best answer is that converts to Christianity on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:10,11) had returned to Rome and formed a congregation there.

如果彼得不是罗马教会的创办人，谁是呢？可能最好的回答是那些在五旬节 改信基督教的人（使徒行传 2:10，11） 回到罗马，并在那里形成了教会。
 
 
###### OCCASION AND PURPOSE  场合及目的

For a long time Paul had wanted to visit the Christians in Rome, but was not able to for various reasons. Until he could get there himself, he decided to write a letter to them. He was probably at Corinth, and he knew that Phoebe, a Christian in that area, was planning to travel to Rome. She could deliver the epistle for him (refer to 16:1-2).
Paul had several purposes in writing the letter. They were:

保罗有很长的时间想去罗马，看望那里的基督徒，但由于各种原因没有能成行。他决定在自己到那里之前先给他们写一封书信。他当时可能是在哥林多，而且他知道一个当地的基督徒名叫菲比正打算去罗马。她可以帮他送达这封书信 （参考 16:1-2）。
保罗写这封书信中的几个目的：

A) To announce his coming to them (1:11-13; 15:24)

B) To give them a thorough course in Christian doctrine

C) To address the problem of a corrupt government (chapter 13)

D) To encourage unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians

A） 宣布他要来看望他们 （1:11-13; 15:24）

B) 给他们一个完整的基督教教义的课程

C） 论述一个腐败政府 的问题（第 13 章）

D） 鼓励犹太人和非犹太人基督徒之间的合一

Let’s read the epistle a chapter at a time, and answer these questions as we go along: 

让我们读这封书信，每一次读一章，并回答这些问题：
 
###### READ ROMANS 1  读罗马书第一章

Verses 16-17 of this chapter could be called the theme of the book of Romans. Here the apostle praises “the gospel”. (Note: This term occurs 96 times in the NIV Bible; 76 of those occurrences are in Paul’s epistles.) Give a brief summary definition of  “the gospel” which God proclaimed through His apostles.

第16- 17 节的这一章可以说是罗马书的主旨。在这里使徒称赞"福音"。(注： 这个词在 NIV 圣经中出现 96 次; 其中76次在保罗的书信中。) 简短阐述"福音"的定义，就是 神通过他的使徒传扬的。

###### READ ROMANS 2 读罗马书第2章

The congregation at Rome was made up of both Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians. Which group was Paul addressing in this chapter? Why do you think that? 

罗马的教会由犹太基督徒和外邦人基督徒组成。保罗这一章是写给谁的？为什么你这么认为？
 

###### READ ROMANS 3 读罗马书第3章

In chapter two the apostle made the case that Jewish people were no less sinful than Gentile people, and therefore under the same condemnation of the law (and therefore must be saved by grace). This chapter now begins to summarize that there is no difference between Jew and Gentile when it comes to sin. In 3:10-18, the apostle quotes Old Testament passages that proclaim that all people are sinful and that no one can be saved by keeping the commandments. 

第二章保罗讲明了犹太人并不比外邦人少犯罪，因此都被律法定同样的罪（因此也必须靠着恩典得救）。这一章在开始时概括犹太人和外邦人在罪的问题上没有区别。在 3:10-18，保罗引用旧约，宣布所有的人都有罪，没有人能靠遵守律法得救。

In v. 24 Paul uses the word “justified.” What does “justify” mean? Who does God justify? (v. 26) How does God justify? (v.24) 
 
在24节 保罗使用一个词"称义"。"称义"是什么意思？神使谁称义？神 ( 26节) 如何使人称义？(24节)
 
###### READ ROMANS 4 读罗马书4章

Paul cites Abraham as an example of how God saves people. Abraham was a “superstar” (a “works” hero) of the Jewish faith and tradition. If something was true for Abraham, it would certainly also be true for others. David is another superhero of the Jewish tradition and Old Testament Scriptures. Abraham was exhibit A, and David was exhibit B. Paul uses these two as examples of salvation by faith. 

保罗用亚伯拉罕作为神如何救人的一个例子。亚伯拉罕是犹太人在信仰和传统上的”超级巨星”（”好行为”英雄）。如果对亚伯拉罕是真的，那么对其他人肯定也会是真的。大卫是犹太传统和旧约圣经的另一个超级英雄。亚伯拉罕是例一，大卫是例二。保罗使用这两个人来做因信称义的例子。

Cite phrases in verses 18-21 that describe Abraham’s faith.

18-21的哪些地方描述了亚伯拉罕的信仰？
 
###### READ ROMANS 5 读罗马书5章

In this chapter Paul address the effects of justification on a believer. 

在这一章保罗讲述称义对信徒的影响。

Jot down the effects (results) of justification by faith that Paul lists in these verses:

写下保罗在这些经文里列出的因信称义的影响（后果）： 

v.1 第1节 

v.2 第2节 

v.3 第3节

v.9 第9节

v.11 第11节
 
###### READ ROMANS 6 读罗马书第6章

Up until now, the apostle has been assembling the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ, apart from works. With the end of chapter five, that discussion is concluded. The two main points that he made were: 

到目前为止，使徒已荟集了在行为之外的因信基督称义的教义。在第五部分的结尾，这方面的讨论已告一段落。他提出的两个要点是：

A) All people (Jews and Gentiles) have sinned and fallen short of righteousness

B) All people (Jews and Gentiles) are justified by faith in Christ

Now, beginning with chapter 6, the apostle takes up a new subject -- sanctification. What is sanctification? 
 
A) 所有的人（包括犹太人和外邦人） 都犯了罪，都不是义人。

B） 所有的人 （犹太人和外邦人） 都因信基督里称义

现在，在第 6 章的开始，使徒要开始一个新的题目 — — 成圣。成圣是什么？
 
###### READ ROMANS 7 读罗马7章

​Here Paul uses marriage as an illustration of living a life of faithfulness to Christ. What is your favorite verse in this chapter? 

在这里保罗用婚姻作为例证说明忠于基督的生活。在这一章中你最喜欢的经句是什么？
 
 
###### READ ROMANS 8 读罗马书8章

​In this chapter the apostle speaks about life under God’s grace, and how we can be confident that we are saved by grace. Trace and comment briefly on the five “steps” that God followed in extending His grace to us in verses 29-30: 

在这一章使徒讲叙在神的恩典下的生活和靠恩典得救的确信。在第 29-30 节中，  找出并简短讨论神赐给我们恩典时使用的五个"步骤"。
 
1)

2) 

3) 

4) 

​5) 
 
###### READ ROMANS 9 读罗马书9章

In this chapter Paul contemplates the fate of his own people, the Jews. In spite of the fact that they had every advantage, most of them rejected the saving grace of God by rejecting Jesus as their Savior. No questions. 

在这一章中保罗思想他自己的人民犹太人的命运。尽管他们有各种优势，但是其中绝大多数是因为拒绝耶稣是他们的救主而拒绝了神救赎的恩典。这一部分没有问题讨论。
 
###### READ ROMANS 10 读罗马书10章

In this chapter Paul shows that the prophets spoke of the Jews rejection of the Gospel message. We are urged not to reject it ourselves. 

In verses 3-4, the apostle talks about two kinds of righteousness. He says that one kind of righteousness comes from God. Where did the Israelites think righteousness comes from? (See verse 5).  Are there really TWO sources of righteousness, or only one?

在这一章中保罗指出先知们讲到犹太人对福音的拒绝。这敦促我们不能拒绝福音。
 
在第 3-4 节使徒讲到有两种义。他说： 有一种义来自神。以色列人认为义来自哪里？（见第 5 节）。 义真的来自于两个源头吗，还是只有一个？

###### READ ROMANS 11 读罗马书11章

Here Paul says that in spite of Jewish unbelief, a remnant (a smaller portion) of the Jews will be saved. He himself is an example of one such believer. Now he specifically addresses the Gentile believers in Rome, urging them to heed the warning that it is possible to have all of God’s favor poured out on you, and still perish through unbelief. 

What is the purpose of the warning in verse 21?

保罗在这里说，尽管犹太人的不信，犹太人中的余民 （一个更小的部分） 将会得救。他自己就是这样犹太人信徒的一个例子。现在他特别针对在罗马的外邦信徒讲话，敦促他们留心如下的警告：也就是即使有神所有的恩惠倾倒在你身上，你仍有可能因为不信而灭亡。

第 21 节警告的目的是什么？
 
###### ROMANS 12 罗马书12章

This chapter is full of encouragement to put our Christian faith into practice. We are encouraged to offer ourselves in service to God, use our spiritual gifts to serve others, love and forgive one another, and strive to overcome evil with good. No questions on this chapter.

这一章中充满了让我们把基督信仰付诸实践的鼓励。这一章鼓励我们把自己献给神，用我们的属灵恩赐服事他人、 爱人和饶恕别人，并努力以善胜恶。这一部分没有问题讨论。

This chapter covers two subjects. What are they? 

这一章涉及两个主题。它们是什么？

1.

2.
 
###### ROMANS 14 罗马书14章

In this chapter the apostle speaks about Christians in the congregation who may be “weak” or “strong.” No matter which we may be, we are encouraged to practice patient love and kindness with the other. 

在这一章使徒谈到基督徒会有"弱"有"强"。不管我们是强是弱，都鼓励我们对别人操练耐心，爱和善良。

Describe each kind of Christian:

The “weak” Christian = 

The “strong” Christian = 
 
描述两类基督徒：

"强"的基督徒 = 
 
###### ROMANS 15 罗马书15章

This chapter continues the instruction of chapter 14. Then, beginning at verse 14, Paul outlines his future goals and plans. What were Paul’s future goals and plans, God willing?

这一章继续第 14 章的教导。然后，从第 14 节开始，保罗概述了他未来的目标和计划。如果 神愿意，保罗的未来的目标和计划是什么？
 
###### ROMANS 16 罗马书16章
