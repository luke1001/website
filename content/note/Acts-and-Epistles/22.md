The following homework assignment is to be completed prior to the next class. It is critical that you complete this homework assignment so that you are prepared, and ready to participate in the next lesson. This homework assignment will consist of two parts:

下面的课后作业要在下节课上课之前完成。这个作业可以让你得到预备，并做好准备参加下一课的学习，所以完成作业对你很重要。这个作业包括两部分：

1.Read Acts 18:23-20:38 (and answer the questions below)

读使徒行传18:23-20:38 （并回答下面的问题）。

2.Read Ephesians (entire epistle) and answer the questions indicated

读以弗所书（整卷书）并回答指定的问题。

##### Introduction: 介绍：

Paul’s 2nd missionary journey ended with a brief visit to the city of Ephesus. He had traveled there from Corinth, together with Aquila and Priscilla. Paul had been gone nearly two years, and was anxious to return to the congregations at Jerusalem and Antioch in order to report to them about the success of the gospel in Europe. 

保罗的第2次宣道旅行快要结束时，他在以弗所城做了短暂的停留。他的上一站是哥林多，随行人员是亚居拉和百基拉。保罗离开了将近两年的时间，极其渴望回到耶路撒冷和安提阿的教会，使他能向他们汇报在欧洲传福音的成功和收获。

After a stay of unknown length in Antioch, Paul set out on his 3rd journey, revisiting some of the young congregations in Asia Minor (Turkey). Meanwhile, a new kingdom worker arrived in Ephesus, who would play an important role in the work of the Lord in Corinth. The date is about A.D. 52 or 53.

在安提阿待了一段时间（长度不确定）之后，保罗开始了他的第三次宣道旅行，并再次看望小亚细亚（今土耳其）的一些新生教会。同时，一位新的国度工人来到了以弗所，他在哥林多的福音事工上起了很重要的角色。时间大约在公元后52或53年。

##### READ ACTS 18:23-28 (APOLLOS) 读使徒行传18:23-28（亚波罗）

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下面的问题：

In Corinth, Paul met Aquila and Priscilla. They had come with him to Ephesus, and remained there Paul went on back to his home church in Antioch. While Priscilla and Aquila were in Ephesus, Apollos arrived from Alexandria (a large and important city in Egypt). 

在哥林多，保罗遇到了亚居拉和百基拉。他们与他一同来到以弗所，并留在那里。保罗接下来又返回到他在安提阿的家庭教会。当百基拉与亚居拉在以弗所期间，亚波罗从亚历山大过来（埃及的一个重要的大城市）。

1\. Why was Apollos especially suited for the gospel work in Corinth?  

1.为什么说亚波罗特别适合做哥林多的福音工作？






##### READ ACTS 19:1-22 (PAUL RETURNS TO EPHESUS)   读使徒行传19:1-22 （保罗回到以弗所）

This section confronts us with the situation of 12 men who had been exposed to the baptism of John the Baptist, but had not received the Holy Spirit. These men had obviously not yet been converted to faith in Christ. So their faith was inaccurate, and probably not even Christian. They were still rooted in an Old Testament faith. Unlike Apollos they had been misled. Not all disciples of John had entered into discipleship of Christ. Their continuation of the baptism of John was no real baptism but a mere dead ceremony. Had they been true followers of John they would have known Christ and heard of the Spirit, (John 3:34, Mark 1:8) they would have had remission of sin and the working of the Holy Spirit. There seems to have been no proclamation of Christ nor his baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Apollos was not re-baptized, but the Ephesians were. Why? In one case, Apollos, there was true and saving faith in the true God and Savior. John’s baptism had been valid. But these 12 Ephesians had a mixed up faith in an incomplete Savior. So Paul baptized them in the name of the Triune God, and they received the Holy Spirit. 

我们在这部分中看到了12个人，他们接受了施洗约翰的洗礼，但还没有领受圣灵。很明显，这些人还没有真正相信基督，所以他们的信心不确定，甚至可以说他们还不是基督徒，因为他们的根基还在旧约里。跟亚波罗不一样，这些人已经被误导了。所以，并不是约翰的所有门徒都有基督门徒的身份。因为他们仍然在使用约翰的洗礼，而那根本就不是真正的洗礼，而只是僵死的仪式。如果他们是约翰的真实跟随者，他们就会已经认识了基督，也已经听过圣灵（约3:34，可1:8），他们的罪也就已经被赦免，也就已经有圣灵在他们身上做工了。他们似乎没有基督的宣告，也没有圣灵与火的洗礼。亚波罗没有再重新接受洗礼，但那些以弗所人重新接受了。为什么？以亚波罗为例，他里面有对真神和救主的真实而得救的信心，所以约翰的洗礼在他身上已经有效了。但这12个以弗所人对救主的信心不清楚，不完整。所以，保罗奉三位一体之神的名给他们施洗，于是他们便领受到了圣灵。

Paul’s gospel preaching was met with great success in Ephesus. The fact that he was allowed to preach Christ in the local synagogue for 3 months was remarkable, because he was rarely given such an opportunity in the other synagogues of his mission trips. 

保罗的福音布道在以弗所获得了极大的成功。他被允许在当地的圣殿里长达3个月传讲基督的事实令人惊讶，因为在他的几次宣道旅行中，在其它圣殿很少得到这样的机会。

2\. How did the Lord provide evidence that the gospel which Paul was preaching was the word of God? 

2.神怎样提供证据，证明保罗所传的福音就是神的话语？


##### READ ACTS 19:23-41 (THE RIOT IN EPHESUS)  读使徒行传19:23-41 （以弗所的暴乱）

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答下列问题：

The temple of the goddess Artemis in Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. People came from all over the Roman empire to visit this temple and participate in the fertility rites conducted by the temple prostitutes. Small silver statues of the goddess were sold as souvenirs to all the pilgrims, and men like Demetrius made a good profit from the sales. The gospel which Paul preached threatened to hinder the whole tourist/souvenir trade, and so the local entrepreneurs caused trouble. 

以弗所的阿蒂米斯女神庙是古代世界的七大奇观之一。人们从罗马帝国的各处来到这里参观这个神庙，并加入到由庙妓主持的生育仪式。女神的小银像作为纪念品向所有朝圣旅游的人出售，而且像底米丢这样的男人们，从这些买卖中获得了极大的利益。保罗所传的福音给他们带来了威胁，阻碍了整个旅游/纪念品的贸易。于是，当地的企业家们便起来制造麻烦。

3\. How did this riot in Ephesus serve to advance the cause of the gospel? 

3.以弗所的这场暴乱怎样帮助推进了福音的事工？


##### READ ACTS 20:1-16 (THE 3RD JOURNEY CONCLUDES)  读使徒行传20:1-16 （第3次宣道旅行结束）

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答下列问题：

From 2 Corinthians we can piece together Paul’s journey in Greece. First Paul sailed north to Troas, where he hoped to meet up with Titus and do missionary work (2 Corinthians 2:12-13). But Titus never arrived in Troas, so Paul continued on to Macedonia, finally contacting Titus there (2 Corinthians 7:6). He probably re-visited as many Christians in Philippi, Berea, and Thessalonica as he could, continuing on until he came back to Corinth, where he wrote the epistle to the Romans. When the weather was favorable for sailing, Paul left from Corinth to head home, via ports in Macedonia and Ephesus. Now, there were seven companions, representatives of the Gentile missions around Greece, and together they would accompany the offerings that had been gathered to the needy Christians in Judea (suffering from famine).   

我们从哥林多后书中可以把保罗在希腊的旅行结合起来。保罗首先向北航行到特罗亚。他在那里希望能与提多会面，并一起开展福音工作（林后2:12-13）。但提多一直没有到特罗亚，所以保罗继续走到马其顿，最终在那里与提多取得了联系（林后7:6）。他尽可能多地再次探望了腓立比、庇哩亚和帖撒罗尼迦的信徒，并一直继续，直到他回到哥林多，并在那里给在罗马的信徒写了罗马书。当天气适合航海旅行时，保罗又从哥林多起行开始回家的旅程，途中经过了马其顿和以弗所的港口。现在，他们共有七个同伴，都是希腊周边地区外邦传教士的代表，一起带着为犹大地（遭遇饥荒）有需要的基督徒募捐的奉献。

In Acts 20:12, it says that the people were comforted by the raising of Eutychus from the dead. Of course they were comforted to have this young man back alive. What else was comforting about this miracle? 

使徒行传20:12节说，人们从犹推古死而复活的事上得了安慰。他们当然会从这个死了又活过来的年轻人身上得到安慰。

4\. What else was comforting about this miracle? 

4.这一神迹还有哪些让人受安慰的地方？


##### READ ACTS 20:17-38 (FAREWELL TO THE EPHESIAN ELDERS)  读使徒行传20:17-38 （告别以弗所的长老）

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答下列问题：

At Miletus, just before sailing for Judea, Paul had the opportunity to meet with the elders of the church in Ephesus. These elders were “overseers” and “shepherds” (20:28), the equivalent of pastors. In his speech to them, he summarized his gospel preaching. Pick out some phrases from his speech that summarize the content of Paul’s preaching. 

在米利都，正当保罗要起航往犹大地出发时，他得到机会与以弗所教会的长老们见面。这些长老是“监督”和“牧者”（20:28），相当于牧师。在与他们的对话中，保罗总结了他的福音工作。

5\. Pick out some phrases from his speech that summarize the content of Paul’s preaching. 

5.从保罗的讲话中挑出一些能总结他福音工作的词句。

#### EPHESIANS 以弗所书

Ephesus was one of the leading cities of the province of Asia. Paul visited Ephesus at the end of the 2nd mission trip, left Aquila and Priscilla there, and returned to Ephesus on the 3rd mission journey where he spent about three years.

以弗所是亚细亚省的主要城市。保罗在他第2次布道旅行结束时访问了以弗所，在那里离开了亚居拉和百基拉，后来又在第三次布道旅行时回到以弗所，并在那里待了三年时间。

At the end of the 3rd mission journey, Paul met with the Ephesian elders (Acts 20), giving them final encouragement. 

在第3次布道旅行结束时，保罗遇到了以弗所的长老（徒20），对他们作了最后的鼓励。

In addition to the letter which Jesus addressed to the Ephesus church (Revelation 2:1-7), the apostle Paul also wrote a letter, the Ephesian epistle. This letter was written while Paul was imprisoned in Rome, several years after his meeting with the Ephesian elders. 

除了耶稣向以弗所教会发出的书信外（启2:1-7），使徒保罗也写了一封信，即以弗所书。这封信是保罗在罗马的监狱中写的，写于他与以弗所的长老见面的几年之后。

Ephesians was one of the “prison epistles” We read in Ephesians 3:1 – “I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles…” We have additional references to Paul’s imprisonment in 4:1 - “as a prisoner for the Lord” and 6:20 - “I am an ambassador in chains”. Paul wrote three other epistles at the same time: Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon. These four are the “prison epistles.” 

以弗所书是“监狱书信”的其中一卷。我们在以弗所书3:1“因 此 ， 我 ─ 保 罗 为 你 们 外 邦 人 作 了 基 督 耶 稣 被 囚 的 ， 替 你 们 祈 祷 （ 此 句 乃 照 对 十 四 节 所 加 ） 。”有关保罗被囚的经文还有4:1—“我 为 主 被 囚 的 劝 你 们 ： 既 然 蒙 召 ， 行 事 为 人 就 当 与 蒙 召 的 恩 相 称 。”，以及6:20 –“我 为 这 福 音 的 奥 秘 作 了 带 锁 炼 的 使 者 ， 并 使 我 照 着 当 尽 的 本 分 放 胆 讲 论 。”

It can readily be seen that the four prison epistles were written about the same time. They are closely connected. Ephesians and Colossians have 55 identical verses, and were both delivered by Tychicus (Colossians 4:7 and Ephesians 6:21). Colossians and Philemon have Onesimus in common: “He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you” (Colossians 4:9) and “I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains” (Philemon 10). These epistles were written from Rome sometime in the early AD 60’s. 

可以很容易看到，这四卷监狱书信是在同一时间写的，它们之间的联系很紧密。以弗所书和歌罗西书有55句完全相同的经文，而且二者都是由推基古递送的（西4:7和弗6:21）。歌罗西和腓利门里面都有阿 尼 西 母：“9我 又 打 发 一 位 亲 爱 忠 心 的 兄 弟 阿 尼 西 母 同 去 ； 他 也 是 你 们 那 里 的 人 。 他 们 要 把 这 里 一 切 的 事 都 告 诉 你 们 。”（西4:9）以及“就 是 为 我 在 捆 锁 中 所 生 的 儿 子 阿 尼 西 母 （ 就 是 有 益 处 的 意 思 ） 求 你 。”（门10）这些书信都是在公元60年早期的某个时候从罗马写出来的。

The letter to the Ephesians has two sections: 

这封给以弗所教会的信包括两个部分：

- Chapters 1-3 = Christian doctrine

    第1-3章= 基督教教义（信条）

- Chapters 4-6 = Christian ethics

    第4-6章= 基督教伦理（道德标准）

2. The phase “in Christ” is very important in all of Paul’s epistles. In Paul’s mind, everything depends on Christ and Christ is all in all. In this section Paul mentions many blessings that are ours only “in Christ”. Name them. 

    “在基督里”一词在保罗的所有书信里都非常重要。在保罗的思想中，一切都仰赖基督，而且基督是最最重要的。在这部分中，保罗提到很多只有“在基督里”才能得到的祝福。请指出来。
