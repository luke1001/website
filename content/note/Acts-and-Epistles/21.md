##### WHAT IS “CHURCH DISCIPLINE”? 教会纪律指的是什么？

Read Luke 17:3  

读路加福音17:3

If a fellow Christian sins, we are to ___________________________________.

如果某个基督徒犯了罪，我们要___________________________________.

If a sinner repents, we are to ____________________________________.

如果一个罪人悔改了，我们要___________________________________.

Read Proverbs 13:24 and Revelation 3:19 

读箴言书13:24和启示录3:19

God wants us to associate discipline with ________________ 

神要我们把纪律与______________________连起来。

##### Notes: 注意：

- “Discipline” = “to educate, to teach” (The word “discipline” comes from the same word as “disciple” = someone who follows and learns)

    “纪律/管教”= “教育，教导”（“纪律/管教”与“门徒”(一个跟随并学习的人)都来自同一个词。）

- The terminology “church discipline” may be used in a broad or narrow sense. 

    “教会纪律”一词可用于它的广义或者狭义。

- Broad sense: The entire process of admonition, from private admonition to the final stages of public admonition of the entire church, as outlined in Matthew 18:15-18.

    从广义上讲：指整个劝诫过程，包括私人劝诫到整个教会最后公开的劝诫过程，就像马太福音18:15-18所列出的。

- Narrow sense: The final stages of admonition when the process of personal and private brotherly admonition moves to the stages where the entire congregation is involved. 

    狭义上讲：指劝诫的最后阶段，有个人私下所做的兄弟般的劝诫到整个教会参与进来的阶段。

##### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OR GOAL OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE? 教会纪律管教的目的或目标是什么？

Read Galatians 6:1-2

读加拉太书6:1-2

The purpose and goal of all church discipline is to ________________.

所有教会纪律的目的和目标是要___________________。

Read Romans 12:17-19 

读罗马书12:17-19 

The purpose or goal of discipline is never to: __________________.
纪律和管教的目标和目的永远不是  _________________。

##### Notes: 注释：

- The purpose of church discipline is to teach a person in a loving way the grave consequences of unrepentant sin. Impenitence, since it leads to loss of faith and eternal damnation, is something that a concerned group of Christians will care about. Thus, church discipline is not about punishment, but Christian love.

    教会纪律和管教的目的是以一种慈爱的方式把罪不悔改的严重后果教导给人。因为顽固不悔改的后果是失去信心，然后招致永远的咒诅，所以每一个有爱心的基督徒群组都会去关爱。因此，教会的纪律管教不是要惩罚，而是出于基督的爱。

- Embarrassing or humiliating the sinner have no place in proper church discipline, nor do revenge or punishment.

    让罪人难堪或受羞辱不是合适的教会纪律管教，报复和惩罚也不合适。

- Proper church discipline is not done to “clean up the membership role” but to help the sinner. 

    合适的教会纪律管教不是为了“清理会员的角色”，而是为了帮助罪人。

- Rumor and hear-say is not sufficient evidence to pursue church discipline. We must rebuke sin only when there is clear evidence of it. 

    流言蜚语和道听途说不是足够的证据，不足以施行教会的纪律管教。我们只有在证据确凿的情况下才必须要去谴责罪。

- Mass excommunications of groups or large numbers of people, even if the sin is the same (such as neglect of the means of grace) is never proper. Each individual case is special and unique.

    把成群或大量的人大批逐出教会，即使罪责是一样的（如忽略恩典的通道），都永远不是合适的做法。每一个个体的情况都是特别和独特的。

##### WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CHURCH DISCIPLINE? 谁负责教会的纪律管教？

Read Colossians 3:16  What are Christians to do for each other? 

读歌罗西书3:16 基督徒要为彼此做什么事情？

Read James 5:19-20  What are Christians to do for each other?

读雅各书5:19-20 基督徒要为彼此做什么事情？

Read Leviticus 19:17  What are Christians to do for each other? 

读利未记19:17 基督徒要为彼此做什么事情？

##### Notes:  注释：

- Brotherly admonition is a duty which all Christians owe one another. 

    兄弟般的劝诫是所有基督徒当为彼此承担的责任。

- It consists of speaking to a fellow Christian about his sin, urging him to repent of it and forsake it.

    它包括向另一个基督徒指出他的罪，催促他悔改并离弃那个罪。

- This is not the duty of the pastor alone, or of the church council alone. 

    这不只是牧师一个人的责任，也不只是教会理事会的责任。

##### HOW IS CHURCH DISCIPLINE CARRIED OUT? 教会的纪律管教如何实施？ 

Read Matthew 18:15-17 

读马太福音18:15-17 

What are the four steps or stages of church discipline as outlined by Jesus in these verses?

在以下经文中，耶稣列出的教会管教的四个步骤或阶段是什么？

v.15  ___________________________

v. 16  ___________________________

v. 17a  ___________________________ 

v. 17b  ___________________________ 

#####  Notes on the first three stages of church discipline. 注释：教会管教的前三个步骤：

Stage One: Private Admonition

步骤一：私下劝诫

- This stage may be carried out by any and every Christian, including the pastor.

    这一步骤任何一个基督徒都可以做，包括牧师。

- The private admonition should rarely be limited to a single contact.

    私下劝诫不应该在只接触一次之后就进行。

- Patient and humble instruction, with a careful use of the Word of God, is used during private admonition. The facts need to be carefully substantiated during this stage. 

    在私下劝诫期间，要耐心、谦卑地教导，并要小心使用神的话语。在这一阶段中，需要很小心地来证实事实。

Stage Two: Discipline with One or Two Witnesses
步骤二：带一两个见证人去规劝

- When a Christian needs to involve one or two witnesses, the concerned Christian will invite one or two others to accompany him or her on the visit, but will not tell the witnesses about the situation ahead of time. The witnesses need to be neutral and unprejudiced so that they can testify to the truth with integrity.

    当一个基督徒需要一两个见证人参与时，相关的基督徒会邀请一两个人来陪同他一起去探访，但不要提前把具体情况告诉他们。见证人需要站在中立而不带偏见的角度，使他们能诚实、正直地见证实情。

- As in stage one, a number of contacts are usually made in making every attempt to avoid taking the case beyond this stage.
跟步骤一一样，需要尽一切努力来避免案情继续往下发展， 所以通常需要多次接触。

Stage Three: Taking It To The Church
步骤三：带到教会

- As in stage two, when the discipline matter comes to this stage, the church should only be told in the presence of the one who is under discipline so that he or she can defend him/herself and answer to the charges of sin and impenitence. Every effort needs to be made to have the person who is under discipline present in person at the meeting at which the case is brought forward.

    正如在步骤二中，当管教的事情到达这一步时，要把这件事告诉教会，必须要在被管教的人在场才可以这样做，使他可以为自己辩护，也能够为自己的罪和不悔改的指责做出回应。在处理这一案件的每一次努力中，都需要被管教的人亲自在场出席会议。

- Once again, repeated contacts are often appropriate during this stage of discipline as every effort is made to regain the sinner.

    同样，在管教的这一阶段中，做出每一份努力来挽回罪人时，都需要有多次的接触。

- “The Church” is understood to mean the local congregation. This stage can take place in a properly called meeting of the congregation, or its representatives (such as a voters assembly).

    “教会”指的是当地的教会。这一阶段可以在一个能够称为教会会议，或它的代表会议（如选民大会）的场合中进行。
