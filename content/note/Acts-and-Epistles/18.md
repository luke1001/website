#### Act 17 and 1 & 2 Thessalonians  使徒行传 17章 与 帖撒罗尼迦前后书


The following homework assignment is to be completed prior to the next class. It is critical that you complete this homework assignment so that you are prepared, and ready to participate in the next lesson. This homework assignment will consist of two parts:

1. Read Acts 17 (and answer the questions below)

2. Read 1 and 2 Thessalonians and answer the questions indicated

以下作业请在下一节课之前完成。完成本作业很重要，因为这样你就做好准备参加下一课。本作业由两部分组成：

1. 读使徒行传第十七章 （并回答下面的问题）

2. 读帖撒罗尼迦前后书 并回答指定的问题

##### Introduction: 引言
Last week our Acts reading was the account of the beginning of Paul’s 2nd mission journey. We followed the mission team of Paul, Silas, Timothy (and Luke sometimes) from Antioch, through what is now southern Turkey, and on into the northern Greece city of Philippi. 

上周，我们的所读的使徒行传是关于保罗的第二次宣教旅程中的开始部分。我们跟随保罗，西拉，提摩太(有时还有路加)的宣教小组，从安提阿，穿过现在的土耳其南部，并进入希腊北部的腓立比。

Now, in Acts 17, we continue the account of the 2nd journey, as Paul and his companions travel southwest to Thessalonica. 

现在，在使徒行传第十七节中，我们继续第二次旅程的叙述，随着保罗和他的同伴们往西南向帖撒罗尼迦前行。

Thessalonica was a large city, the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. It was strategically located on the Egnatian Way, a Roman military highway, and also had a nice harbor on the Aegean Sea. It was a hub of commerce and east/west travel in the Roman empire, and one of the most important cities in the region.

帖撒罗尼是一个大城市，是罗马马其顿省的首都。它很战略性地位于罗马的军事公路—爱格纳大道，它还有一个位于爱琴海的很好的港口。它是罗马帝国的商业和东/西旅行的中心，是该地区最重要的城市之一。

Unlike Philippi, which was too small to have a Jewish synagogue, Thessalonica had a large Jewish population with a synagogue. It was about A.D. 50 when Paul’s mission team arrived in this lively city. 

与腓立比城市不一样，腓立比城市太小，没有犹太人的犹太教堂。帖撒罗尼却是有一个庞大的犹太人群体和一个犹太教堂。保罗的宣教小组来到这个充满活力的城市是在差不多公元后五十年的时候。

###### READ ACTS 17:1-9 (MISSION WORK IN THESSALONICA)  读使徒行传17:1-9（在帖撒罗尼迦的宣教事工）

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

Once again, Paul and Silas chose to begin their Gospel proclamation in the local synagogue, a logical starting place to proclaim Christ. In vs. 3-4 it says that Paul “reasoned, explained, and proved” that Christ had to suffer and rise again. This probably involved using Old Testament prophesies about the Messiah’s suffering and death and explaining how those prophecies were fulfilled in the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Can you cite (by giving the Scripture reference) just one Old Testament Messianic prophecy that Paul might have used in his teaching?  

保罗和西拉又一次选择在当地会堂里开始他们的福音宣讲，这是一个很合乎逻辑的宣扬基督的开始地点。3-4节叙说保罗“辨论，讲解，证明”基督必须受苦和复活。这可能包括使用旧约圣经中关于弥赛亚的受苦和死亡的预言，并解释这些预言是如何在耶稣的受苦，死亡和复活中得已应验。你能说出一个保罗可能在他的教导中使用过的旧约中的弥赛亚的预言吗？请把经文章节指出来。

In 1 Thessalonians 2:1-9, Paul recalls his brief (about a month) but stormy ministry in Thessalonica. Take a moment to …

在帖撒罗尼迦前书 2:1-9节中，保罗回忆他在帖撒罗尼迦的简短（大概只有一个月）但疾风暴雨式的宣教。花点时间来…

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 2:1-9  读帖撒罗尼迦前书 2:1-9

In these verses Paul hints at some of the accusations that the Jews were making about his ministry in Thessalonica. Write down what some of those accusations may have been. The first one is filled in for you as an example. 

在这些经文中，保罗暗示了犹太人在帖撒罗尼迦对他的事工所做的一些指控。写下一些可能的指控。第一个己填充作为例子。

2:3 = Paul had impure motives (such as greed) and was only trying to trick the people

2:3 = 保罗有不纯的动机(如贪婪)，他只是想欺骗人。

2:4 = 

2:5 = 

2:6 = 

###### READ ACTS 17:10-15 (MISSION WORK IN BEREA)  读使徒行传17:10-15（在庇哩亚的宣传事工）

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

​Having experienced persecution in Thessalonica (since his conversion to Christianity in Acts 9, this was the 6th time Paul had to leave an area because of persecution), the mission team traveled about 45 miles (72 km) southwest to the small town of Berea. 

​In Berea, the mission work was met with great success. However, some of the Jewish opposition from Thessalonica came down to Berea and made accusations against Paul, making it necessary for him to leave. The rest of the team was able to continue sharing the gospel in Berea, while Paul went ahead to Athens.  

​The Bible says that the Bereans were of “more noble character.” How did the Bereans show their noble character when the mission team brought the Gospel to them?

在帖撒罗尼经历了迫害后(自从他皈依基督教以来，见使徒行传9，这是保罗第六次因迫害而不得不离开一个地区)，宣教小组往西南方向旅行大约45英里(72公里)到达庇哩亚的一個小镇。

​在庇哩亚，宣教事工取得了巨大成功。然而，一些来自帖撒罗尼的犹太反对势力来到庇哩亚，控告保罗，使他不得不离开。其余的队员在庇哩亚继续分享福音，但保罗前往雅典。

圣经说，庇哩亚人有更高尚的品格。当宣教小组把福音带给他们时，庇哩亚人是如何表现出他们高尚的品格的？

###### READ ACTS 17:16-34 (MISSION WORK IN ATHENS)  读使徒行传17:16-34（在雅典的宣传事工）

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

Forced to leave Berea, Paul traveled alone to the large Geek city of Athens, where he would wait for Silas and Timothy to rejoin him. Athens was past its prime, but still a magnificent city filled with art, culture, beauty and knowledge. The great Greek philosophers Plato, Aristotle and Socrates had once lived there. The Greeks had constructed magnificent shrines to the goddess Athena there. And on the acropolis, a rocky hill around which the city was built, there were several magnificent heathen temples to the guardian deities of Athens, including the world famous Parthenon. The people were the most cultivated and refined of Greece, and yet the most thoroughly given to idolatry.

Paul was confronted by two groups of Greek philosophers – the Stoics and the Epicureans. The Stoics were basically pantheist, believing that all things in nature were gods. They taught that true wisdom was living in harmony with nature. The Epicureans taught that the only reality was that which could be experienced with the senses (such as touch, sight, etc.). Therefore, they were essentially atheist in their religious views. They focused on pleasure as the highest goal in life. 

Verses 22-31 record one of Paul’s “sermons” for the second time. (The first recorded sermon of Paul was preached in Pisidian Antioch and recorded in Acts 13:16:41.) Compare the two sermons. How are they different and why? How are they similar and why? 

保罗被迫离开庇哩亚，独自前往雅典的大城市，在那里，他等待着西拉和提摩太来与他汇合。雅典已经过了它最辉煌的时刻，但仍然是一个充满艺术、文化、美丽和知识的宏伟城市。伟大的希腊哲学家柏拉图、亚里士多德和苏格拉底都曾在此居住过。希腊人在那里为雅典娜女神建造了宏伟的神殿。这个城市的卫城是环绕一个岩石山而建立，在这山上有几座为雅典的守护神而建的宏伟异教寺庙，其中包括举世闻名的帕台农神庙。雅典人是希腊最有教养、最优雅的人，但又是最沉迷于偶像崇拜的。

保罗面对着两群希腊哲学家-斯多亚学派与伊比鳩鲁派。斯多亚学派基本上是泛神论者，相信自然界中的一切都是神。他们教导真正的智慧是与自然和睦相处。伊比鳩鲁派教导唯一的真实是可以用感官(如触摸、视觉等)体验的，因此，他们的宗教观本质上是无神论的。他们把快乐当做人生最高的目标。

第22至31节是第二次记录保罗的“讲道”。(第一次记录保罗的讲道是他在安提阿的彼西底布道，见使徒行传13：16：41)。比较这两篇讲道。他们有什么不同，为什么？它们有什么相似，为什么？

##### 1 THESSALONIANS 帖撒罗尼迦前书
Because of the Jewish persecution, Paul was forced to leave Thessalonica sooner than he had planned. While he was in Thessalonica, his friends at Philippi had been sending him gifts so that he could focus on preaching the gospel in that important Roman city (see Philippians 4:16). After just three weeks, the Gospel was already bearing fruit and a congregation was forming. 

But Jewish persecution was especially fierce in Thessalonica. The Jews were so enraged that they even caused trouble for Jason, who was practicing genuine Jewish hospitality, and then even traveling all the way to Berea to cause trouble there. Paul had gone ahead down to Athens, and was waiting for Silas and Timothy to rejoin him there, but he was concerned about those new Christians back in Thessalonica. How were they holding up in the face of all this persecution and opposition? 

Soon Timothy and Silas came from Berea and rejoined Paul in Athens. Paul wanted the new Thessalonian church to know about his love for them, and he wanted to give them words of encouragement, but it was too dangerous for him to go himself. So he immediately sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to strengthen and encourage the new Christians. When Timothy rejoined the mission team down in Corinth, he brought an encouraging report about the Thessalonian congregation. Not only had they remained faithful to Christ in the face of pressure from persecution, but they were spreading the gospel all over Macedonia! 

That report brought great joy to Paul, so he wrote the epistle of 1 Thessalonians to them. He wanted them to know how thankful he was for their faithfulness and for the fruits of faith worked in them by the Gospel. This epistle was one of first epistles Paul penned. It was written in about A.D. 51 or 52 from Corinth. Perhaps only Galatians was written earlier. 

由于犹太人的迫害，保罗被迫提前离开帖撒罗尼迦。他在帖撒罗尼迦的时候，他在腓立比的朋友们送给他礼物，使他能专注于在那个重要的罗马城市宣讲福音(见腓立比书4：16)。短短三周后，福音已经结出果子，一个教会也在形成。

但从帖撒罗尼迦犹太人来的迫害尤为激烈。犹太人非常愤怒，甚至为耶孙带来了麻烦，耶孙不过是在奉行真正的犹太待客之道。他们甚至一路去到庇哩亚，在那里制造麻烦。保罗去到雅典，等待西拉和提摩太在那里与他汇合，但他为那些在帖撒罗尼迦的新基督徒担忧。他们是如何面对这些迫害和反对呢？

很快提摩太和西拉从庇哩亚来，在雅典与保罗汇合。保罗想让帖撒罗尼迦的新教会知道他对他们的爱，并给他们鼓励的话语，但他自己亲自去是太危险。于是，他立即把提摩太送回帖撒罗尼迦去加强和鼓励新的基督徒们。当提摩太回到哥林多的宣教小组时，他带了一份关于帖撒罗尼迦教会的令人鼓舞的报告。他们不仅在迫害的压力下保持对基督忠心，而且还在马其顿各地传播福音！

那份报告给保罗带来了极大的喜悦，于是他写帖撒罗尼迦前书这书信给他们。他想让他们知道他是多么因他们的信心以及福音在他们那里结出的信心的果子而感恩。这封书信是保罗写的第一封书信。它写在哥林多大约公元后51年到 52年。有可能只有加拉太书写得比它早一点。 

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 1  读帖撒罗尼迦前书第一章

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 2  读帖撒罗尼迦前书第二章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

Earlier in this study we were assigned to read 2:1-9 and analyze. In verses 10-16 Paul says that the word which had been proclaimed to them was not just the “word of men” but actually “the word of God.” This is a critical truth, for the word of mere men is subject to error. In contrast the word of God is truth, with no possibility of error. How do we know that the gospel which Paul and Silas had been sharing was not just the word of men, but actually the true word of God? 

在前面的学习中，我们被要求阅读与分析2:1至9节。在第10至16节中，保罗说，向他们宣讲的话不仅仅是“人的话”，而实际上是“上帝的话”。这是一个关键的真理，因为人的话总会有错。与其相反的是，神的话是真理，没有犯错的可能性。我们怎样知道保罗和西拉所分享的福音，不单是人的话，实际上是神的话？


###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 3  读帖撒罗尼迦前书第三章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答以下问题：

In this chapter Paul states again and again how encouraged he was to hear about the faith of the Thessalonians (see 3:7). In what ways does the faith of other Christians encourage us? 

在这一章中，保罗一再强调他是如何因帖撒罗尼迦人的信心受鼓舞(见3：7)。其他基督徒的信仰是怎样鼓励我们的？

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 4:1-12  读帖撒罗尼迦前书4:1-12

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

Now, having been encouraged by the Thessalonians, Paul seeks to encourage them in return. What three things does he encourage them to practice more and more? And how would those three areas affect the Christian’s witness and ministry? 

现在，受了帖撒罗尼迦人的鼓舞，保罗回过头来努力鼓励他们。他鼓励他们多多操练哪三件事？这三个领域如何影响基督徒的见证与事工？

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 4:13-5:11  读帖撒罗尼迦前书4:13-5:11

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

In this section Paul addresses some subjects related to the second coming of Christ on the last day. Perhaps the Thessalonians had been wondering about some of the things which Paul teaches in these verses. What two truths do these verses teach about the return of Christ? 

在本段中，保罗谈到了有关基督第二次降临的一些议题。也许保罗在这些经文中教导的一些东西，帖撒罗尼迦人也一直在猜想。这些经文中教导了关于基督再来的哪两个真理？

###### READ 1 THESSALONIANS 5:12-28  读帖撒罗尼迦前书5:12-28

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

These verses contain more than a dozen encouragements regarding different aspects of the Christian life. Which one do you most need right now and why? 

这些经文包含了对基督教生活不同方面的很多鼓励。你现在最需要的是哪一个，为什么？


##### 2 THESSALONIANS  帖撒罗尼迦后书

This second letter to the Thessalonians was written within a few months of the first while Paul, Timothy, and Silas were still in Corinth. Why did Paul write this follow-up letter so soon after the first? Perhaps he had received a reaction to the first epistle and learned that there was some confusion about something he said in it. Perhaps he simply wanted to take the time to expand on some of the things about which he had quickly written in the first epistle. In any case, the second epistle covers much of the same material as the first, namely:

- Thanksgiving for the faith and love of the Thessalonians

- Encouragement to practice their faith in the midst of persecution

- Teaching about the second coming of Christ

There seems to be a special emphasis on the second coming of Christ in this letter. It seems that this was an area which needed some clarification because some people were saying that Jesus had already returned. In fact, there was a rumor in Thessalonica that Paul had been teaching that Jesus had already returned. There was an immediate need to once again address the  second coming of Christ. 

写给帖撒罗尼迦人的第二封信是在写了第一封信后的几个月内写的。保罗、提摩太和西拉当时仍在哥林多。为什么保罗写第一封信之后不久又写了这封更进的信呢？也许他收到了他们对第一封信的反应，知道他们对他信里的一些话有些困惑。也许他只是想花点时间来拓展一些他在第一封书信中很快写下的一些内容。不过第二封书信的内容与第一封内容很相似，即：

- 为帖撒罗尼迦人的信仰和爱感恩

- 鼓励他们在迫害中操练他们的信仰

- 关于基督第二次降临的教导

在这封信中似乎特别强调基督的第二次降临。看来这是一个需要澄清的领域，因为有些人说耶稣已经回来了。事实上，在帖撒罗尼迦有谣言说保罗在教导耶稣已经回来了。确实有必要再次论述基督的第二次降临。
 
###### READ 2 THESSALONIANS 1  读帖撒罗尼迦后书第一章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

By this point in our study, we are well aware of the persecution and trouble that the Christians in Thessalonica were enduring. What does Paul write about that in this chapter which he has not written previously? 

学到现在，我们清楚地认识到帖撒罗尼迦的基督徒所遭受的迫害和麻烦。保罗在这章里写的什么是他以前没有写过的？ 

###### READ 2 THESSALONIANS 2 读帖撒罗尼迦后书第二章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

In this chapter Paul mentions that Jesus will not return until a “man of lawlessness” (“man of sin”) is revealed. This person is not named, but he is described. Look at the following verses and write down descriptive phrases about this “man of lawlessness”. 

在这章中保罗提到，在一个大罪人被揭露出来之前，耶稣不会回来。没有提这个人的名字，但他被描述。看看下面的经文，并写下描述这位大罪人的句子。

2:3 = 

2:4a = 

2:4b = 

2:4c = 

2:6 = 

2:7 = 

2:8 = 

2:9 = 


This “man of lawlessness” is not named. His identity is kept secret. However, because of his opposition to Christ, he is sometimes referred to as “the antichrist.” 

这位“大罪人”的名字没有给出。他的身份是隐秘的，由于他敌对基督，有时他被称为“敌基督”。

###### READ 2 THESSALONIANS 3  读帖撒罗尼迦后书第三章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

In 1 Thessalonians, Paul had warned the people about idleness. Some have suggested that perhaps the Thessalonians figured that since Jesus was coming back immediately, they should just retire from work and wait for Him. Paul had encouraged the Christians in Thessalonica to keep working and not stop. But the problem was more than just a misunderstanding about the return of Christ. The true problem was laziness. It was a refusal or conscious decision not to work. This was a sin that called for repentance. 

Paul tried to set a very positive example for the Thessalonians. In verses 7-9 he mentions that he worked day and night to take care of his own needs, without relying on any help or gifts from others. In Acts 18:3 we learned that Paul worked as a tentmaker. But Paul also wrote that he even though he worked to support himself, he had the “right to such help”? -- what kind of help did he have the right to? (Read also Galatians 6:6). Do pastors today have the right to such help?

在帖撒罗尼迦前书中，保罗曾因懒惰这事警告过他们。有些人猜想可能是帖撒罗尼迦人会认为，既然耶稣会马上回来，他们就应该不再工作而应来等候他。保罗鼓励帖撒罗尼迦的基督徒继续工作而不是停止工作。但问题不仅仅是对基督再来的误解。真正的问题是懒惰。是一种对工作的拒绝或有意识的决定不去工作。这是一种罪，必须悔改。

保罗试图为帖撒罗尼迦人树立一个非常积极的榜样。在第7至9节中，他提到他夜以继日地工作来供应自己的需要，而不是依赖别人的帮助或礼物。在使徒行传18：3中，我们得知保罗是一位织帐篷的人。但保罗也写道，尽管他作工供应自己，但他有“得这样帮助的权柄“？-他有权柄得到什么样的帮助？（也读加拉太书6：6)。牧师今天有这样的权柄吗？
