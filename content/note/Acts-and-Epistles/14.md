###### Introduction: 导言：

Our reading this week will cover the apostle Paul’s first mission journey. At the end of Acts 12, we heard that Paul (Saul) and Barnabas had delivered a relief offering for the Christians in Jerusalem who were suffering from famine. Now they have returned to Antioch in Syria, a congregation known for including both Jewish and Gentile converts. An exciting new venture begins as the mission-minded Christians at Antioch send Paul and Barnabas on a trip into the Gentile world. 

我们本周的阅读将涵盖使徒保罗的第一次布道旅程。使徒行传第十二章结束时，我们听说保罗(扫罗)和巴拿巴为耶路撒冷的基督徒发了一份救济的捐献，因为他们正遭受饥荒。现在，他们回到了叙利亚的安提阿，一个以包括犹太人和外邦人而著称的教会。有传道精神的安提阿基督徒开始了一个激动人心的新事工，他们把保罗和巴拿巴送进了向外邦人传道的旅程。


###### READ ACTS 13:1-12 (A NEW MISSION TEAM VISITS CYPRUS)  读使徒行传13：1-12日(一个新的传道小组访问塞浦路斯)

Cyprus was an island about 150 miles from Antioch. Stephen had once shared the gospel in Cyprus, and Barnabas was from Cyprus, so it made sense to go there first. Paul and Barnabas had a helper with them named John (also called Mark – Acts 12:12) who was a cousin of Barnabas (Colossians 4:10). 

塞浦路斯是离安提阿约150英里的岛屿。斯蒂芬曾经在塞浦路斯分享过福音，巴拿巴是塞浦路斯人，所以先去那里是有道理的。保罗和巴拿巴有一个帮手，叫约翰(又叫马可-使徒行传12：12)，他是巴拿巴的表兄弟(歌罗西书4：10)。

The first place that Paul and Barnabas went to share the Gospel was a Jewish synagogue. In fact, we will see that they often began mission work in a city by visiting a synagogue. Why was this a good mission strategy? 

保罗和巴拿巴去分享福音的第一个地方是犹太会堂。事实上，我们会看到，他们常常以访问犹太教堂开始在一个城市里工作。为什么这是一个好的宣道策略？



###### READ ACTS 13:13-52 (THE MISSION TEAM VISITS ASIA MINOR)  读使徒行传13：13-52(宣道小组访问亚洲小亚细亚)

From Cyprus, the mission team sailed north to the Roman province of Asia Minor (which is modern Turkey). They soon came to Pisidian Antioch where they preached the Gospel of Christ. Here we see the beginning of a pattern of persecution, as Satan stirs up opposition to the Gospel.

Summarize Paul’s message in Pisidian Antioch in a couple of sentences: 

从塞浦路斯开始，传道小组向北航行到了罗马的小亚细亚(这是现代土耳其)。他们很快来到了彼西底的安提阿，在那里宣讲基督福音。在这里，我们看到了一种迫害模式的开始，因为撒旦激起了对福音的反对。

用几句话总结保罗在彼西底的安提阿的讯息：

###### READ ACTS 14:1-28 (THE FIRST MISSION TRIP IS COMPLETED)  读使徒行传14：1-28（完成第一次宣道）

The first mission trip was the shortest in both distance covered and in time spent. When the mission team returned back home to Antioch, they gave a report on the trip to the entire congregation. As a result of reading chapters 13 and 14, give a brief summary report of that first mission trip and its results. 

第一次宣道之旅在距离和时间上是最短的。当宣道团返回安提阿时，他们就向整个会众汇报了他们的旅程。请读第13章和第14章，简要介绍第一次宣道行程及其结果。


###### READ ACTS 15:1-35 (THE COUNCIL AT JERUSALEM)  读使徒行传15：1-35（耶路撒冷的会议）
This is the account of the first meeting between representatives of the two large Christian congregations in Jerusalem and Antioch. What was the disagreement that the meeting was meant to resolve? 


这是耶路撒冷和安提阿两大基督教会代表之间第一次会议的讲话。会议意在解决的不同意见是什么？

Who were the representatives on each side? 

谁是每一方的代表？ 

Both Peter and James spoke against requiring Gentiles to be circumcised before they could be saved. What reasons did they give for their judgment? 

彼得和雅各都反对要求外邦人受割礼才能得救。他们有什么理由作出他们的判断？

What was the conclusion of the conference? 

会议的结论是什么？

##### GALATIANS  加拉太书

Paul’s letter to the Galatians is not very long (just a few pages), but it is one of the most important epistles because it so powerfully defends the gospel of salvation by faith in Christ. Dr. Martin Luther said of this epistle: “The Epistle to the Galatians is my own little epistle I have betrothed myself to it; it is my Catherine von Bora.” 

保罗写给加拉太书的信不是很长(只有几页)，但它是最重要的书信之一，因为它有力地捍卫了基督信仰救赎的福音。马丁路德博士谈到这封书信时说：“对加拉太人的书信是我自己的小书信。我已经把它当作自己未婚妻了，这是我的凯瑟琳·冯·博拉。

Galatians is regarded as of great value at our seminary. Students at our seminary spend a year carefully studying this epistle, verse by verse in the original language. It is a little Bible book that all Christians should read, understand, and treasure. 

加拉太书在我们神学院被认为有极大价值。我们神学院的学生要花一年时间，用原文一句一句仔细研究这封书信。这是一本小小的圣经书，所有基督徒都应该阅读、理解和珍惜。



###### THE GALATIAN PEOPLE  加拉太人

Galatia was a province of the Roman empire located in present day Turkey or Asia Minor. It was named after the Gallic tribes of presentday France (called Gauls or Celts), who had migrated to this area about 280 years before Christ was born. (see map)

加拉太是罗马帝国的一个省，位于今天的土耳其或亚洲小亚细亚。它是以法国现今的高卢部落命名的(名为高卢人或凯尔特人)，在基督出生前大约280年移居到这个地区。(见地图)


###### THE FOUNDING OF THE CONGREGATIONS  教会的成立

Paul and Barnabas came to several cities of southern Galatia (Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe) on the first missionary journey. Paul, Silas, and Timothy visited Galatia near the beginning of the second missionary journey in about AD 50. (see Acts 16:6 also 15:40 and 16:1). Paul’s preaching was warmly received by the Galatians at first (4:14), but later it was challenged by a group of visitors which we shall call “Judaizers” (see below). 

在第一次宣教之旅中，保罗和巴拿巴来到了加拉太南部的几个城市(安提阿，以哥念，路司得，特庇)，。保罗，西拉和提摩太在公元50年代第二次宣教之旅开始时访问了加拉太。(见使徒行传16：6、15：40和16：1) 保罗的布道之初(04：14)在加拉太书受到热烈欢迎，但后来，被一群访问者挑战，我们将称之为“犹太教派”(见下面)。

###### THE AUTHOR OF THE EPISTLE  书信的作者

As we can see from several references in this epistle (1:1; 5:2), Paul was the author of it. He probably had someone (like a secretary) actually put his words down on paper (papyrus?) for him, but he added some closing remarks in his own distinctive handwriting (using large letters -- see 6:11) so that would know that the epistle was genuine. 

我们可以从这封书信中的几个地方中看到(1：1和5：2)，保罗是这封书信的作者。他可能有一个人(像秘书)把他的话写在纸上(纸莎草纸)，但是，他用自己独特的笔迹(用大号字母-见06：11) 加上了一些结束语，这样收信人知道书信是真的从他而来。

###### THE DATE AND PLACE OF COMPOSITION OF THE LETTER  写信的日期和地点
The date and place of origin of the letter are uncertain. It may have been written while Paul was in Corinth on the second missionary journey. If so, then Galatians was the first inspired epistle which was written by Paul (about 50 AD). Others think that the letter was written from Ephesus during Paul’s third mission journey (about 55 AD). 

写信的日期和地点是不确定的。这可能是在保罗在哥林多第二次宣教旅程中写的。如果是这样，加拉太书是保罗写的第一封有鼓励人的书信(约公元年50)。其他人认为这封信是在保罗第三次访问以弗所期间写的(约 公元55 年)。



###### PURPOSE OF THE LETTER 信的目的

After Paul left Galatia to continue the 2nd missionary journey, some visitors came there and began proclaiming that all Christians must be circumcised and keep all of the ceremonial laws of the Old Testament in order to be saved (see 1:6; 6:12; 4:10). This threw the Galatian Christians into confusion (1:7), causing the Christians there to wonder, “Are we saved by faith in Jesus alone, as Paul proclaimed, or are we saved by faith and keeping of the laws of Moses?” We sometimes call these Jewish Christians who were preaching this different gospel of workrighteousness “Judaizers.” But Paul had some harsher terms for them. What did Paul call these people?

在保罗离开加拉太继续第二宣教旅程之后，一些旅行者来到那里加拉太，宣称所有的基督徒都必须受割礼，并保留旧约中所有的礼仪法，这样才可以得救(见1：6； 6：12；和4：10)。这使加拉太的基督徒陷入混乱(1：7)，那里的基督徒产生怀疑：“我们是如保罗所说的因着信耶稣而得救的，还是我们是因着信和遵守摩西律法得救？“我们有时把这些宣讲这个不同的公义的犹太基督徒，叫做“犹太教派“。但保罗对他们有一个更严厉的称呼。保罗是怎么称呼这些人的？


a)(2:4) __________________________________________________________

b)(2:12) _________________________________________________________



Paul accused them of perverting the Gospel of Christ (1:7).  It seems that these Judaizers were also teaching the same ideas back in Jerusalem and Antioch. They were attacking Paul’s credibility, insisting that Paul did not have the authority of an apostle, and that Paul's teachings were his own, not God's. They were hoping to alienate the Gentile Christians against Paul (4:17) and impress the new Gentile converts with their own goodness (6:12). 

保罗谴责他们更改基督福音(1：7)。似乎这些犹太教派也在耶路撒冷和安提阿教同样的思想。他们在攻击保罗的可信度，坚持说保罗没有使徒的权威，保罗的教导是他自己的，不是 神的。他们希望将外邦基督徒与保罗(4：17)疏远，并以他们自己的善良打动新改教的外邦人(6：12)。

Therefore the letter to the Galatians had a twofold purpose. First it was written to defend salvation by faith alone, without the works of the law. Second, it was written to defend Paul’s apostolic authority. 

因此，给加拉太书的书信有两种意思。首先，它是为了捍卫因信得救，不靠律法的工作。第二，它是为了保卫保罗作为使徒的权威而写的。

在第6至10节中，保罗反复使用“福音”一词，并谴责犹太教派更改“基督福音”。保罗所宣讲的基督福音是什么？？(写下保罗在这封书信中所用的短句)

- 3:13 = ____________________

- 3:26 = ____________________
- 4:4-5 = ____________________




In 1:11-12, Paul mentions the three possible sources of the “new gospel” which he was preaching. What are they? 

在1：11-12，保罗提到了他教导的“新福音”的三个可能来源。他们是什么？

1.  ____________________

2. ____________________

3. ____________________

###### READ GALATIANS CHAPTER 2  读加拉太章第2章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

In 2:1-10, Paul summarizes the council held at Jerusalem which was recorded in Acts 15. He writes that the entire matter arose because some false brothers had been “spying on the freedom we have in Christ” (2:4). What is the freedom that we have in Christ?

在2：1-10，保罗总结了耶路撒冷举行的议会，记录在使徒行传15章。他写道，整个事件都是因为一些假兄弟“私下窥探探我们在基督耶稣里的自由”(2：4)。我们在基督耶稣里的自由是什么？



In 2:11-21 we read that Peter had hypocritically withdrawn from table fellowship with the Gentiles out of fear for what those in Jerusalem would think. This sinful behavior led other Jews to withdraw from table fellowship with the Gentiles. Of course, this must have hurt the Christians at Antioch, who might have been led to wonder, “Did Jesus not cleanse us? Are we still unclean?” So Paul publicly rebuked him for doing that. How can the sinful behavior of one Christian affect the other Christians in a congregation? 

在2：11至21日，我们读到，因为害怕耶路撒冷里的人会想到什么，彼得假冒为善地从与外邦人同吃的餐桌上离开。这种罪的行为使其他犹太人也离开了与外邦人的同桌的团契。当然，这一定伤害了安提阿的基督徒们，他们可能会问：“耶稣没有洁净我们吗？“我们仍然是不洁净吗？”于是保罗公开斥责他做的事。一位基督徒的罪的行为会如何影响教会里的其他基督徒？
 




###### READ GALATIANS CHAPTER 3  读加拉太书第3章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答以下问题：

How does the Holy Spirit come: Through faith or through circumcision? (see Acts 10:4448)
