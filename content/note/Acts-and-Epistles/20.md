#### Acts 18:1-22 and 1 Corinthians  使徒行传18：1-22和哥林多前书

The following homework assignment is to be completed prior to the next class. It is critical that you complete this homework assignment so that you are prepared, and ready to participate in the next lesson. This homework assignment will consist of two parts:

1. Read Acts 18:1-22 (and answer the questions below)

2. Read 1 Corinthians and answer the questions indicated

以下作业需要在下次上课之前完成。完成作业很重要，因为这样你就预备好参加下次上课。本次作业包括两个部分：

1. 读使徒行传18：1-22（并回答下面的问题）

2. 读哥林多前书并回答问题

##### Introduction:  导言：
As we continue to read through the book of Acts, we are following Paul’s mission team on the 2nd mission journey into the Gentile world. The mission team generally included Paul, Silas, and Timothy, but other helpers (such as Luke) sometimes joined them. 

当我们继续使徒行传的阅读时，我们就跟着保罗的宣教小组进行第二次宣传旅行，进入了外邦人的世界。宣教小组通常包括保罗、西拉和提摩太，其他帮手(如路加)有时也加入他们。

In our last lesson (Acts 17), we learned that Paul had come by himself to the large Greek city of Athens in the Roman province of Achaia (southern Greece), while Timothy and Silas continued to work up in the province of Macedonia (in the city of Thessalonica). 

在上一课(使徒行传17)中，我们得知保罗亲自来到亚该亚的罗马省(希腊南部)的希腊大城市雅典，提摩太和西拉则在马其顿省(在帖撒罗尼迦城)继续工作。

Now, in Acts 18, Paul continues to travel on by himself and comes to the important city of Corinth in southern Greece. Corinth was a harbor town, which meant shipping, trade, many travelers; and a strategic location for spreading the message of the Gospel. It was the 4th largest city of the Roman Empire. The population was a mix of Romans, Greeks, Jews, Egyptians, sailors, ex-soldiers, ex-slaves, wealthy, and poor. 

现在，在第18章中，保罗继续自己旅行，来到了位于希腊南部的哥林多这个重要城市。哥林多是一个港口城市，它意味着它有航运、贸易、许多旅行者；是一个传播福音的战略性地点。它是罗马帝国第四最大的城市。它的人口包括罗马人、希腊人、犹太人、埃及人、水手、曾经当过士兵的、曾经做过奴隶的、富人和穷人。

​Corinth was a city of loose morals. The Temple of Aphrodite (Venus, goddess of love) had 1,000 prostitutes; and there was gambling. Such things inevitably bring with them a variety of social problems and crime..  Corinth was a tough city, a “sin city” in its day. 

哥林多是一个道德松散的城市。阿佛洛狄忒神庙(维纳斯，爱的女神)有1000名妓女；还有赌博。这些事情不可避免地会带来各种各样的社会问题和犯罪。哥林多是一个恶棍城市，一个“罪恶之城”。
​
​Though Corinth was not a university town like Athens, the people of Corinth were admirers of Greek culture, science, philosophy, spectacles, and games. And they had adopted the Greek religions, erecting many temples including large ones to Apollo and Aphrodite. It was a ripe mission field, and Paul spent about 18 months there in about A.D. 51-52..  

虽然哥林多不是像雅典那样的大学城，但哥林多人却崇拜希腊文化、科学、哲学、表演和体育。他们采用了希腊宗教，建造了许多寺庙，其中包括献给阿波罗和阿佛洛狄忒的大的神庙。这是一个庄稼已熟的宣教之地，保罗在那里大约呆了18个月，大约在公元51-52年。

###### READ ACTS 18:1-17 (MISSION WORK IN CORINTH)  读使徒行传18：1-17日(在哥林多的宣教工作)

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

In Corinth, Paul met Aquila and Priscilla, who would prove to be valuable helpers in the spread of the Gospel. Aquila was from Pontus, a Roman province in northeastern Turkey. On the day of Pentecost, some Jewish people from Pontus were in Jerusalem and were among those who heard the Gospel and became Christians (see Acts 2:9). It is very possible that Aquila became a Christian on the day of Pentecost, for in this chapter we are not told that they were converted through Paul. 

Give a description of this couple from the verses below: 

在哥林多，保罗遇见了亚居拉和百基拉，他们会在福音的传播中成为有很有用的帮手。亚居拉来自土耳其东北部的本都，一个罗马的省。五旬节的那天，从本都来的一些犹太人在耶路撒冷，他们在那群听到福音并成为基督徒的人当中(见使徒行传2：9)。很有可能在五旬节那天，亚居拉成为基督徒。因为在本章中，我们没有看到他们是通过保罗归主的。

从下面的经文描述这对夫妇：

18:2 =

18:2 = 

18:3 =

1 Corinthians 16:19 = 

哥林多前书16:19 = 

Acts 18:18 = 

使徒行传18:18 = 

Acts 18:26 = 

使徒行传18:26 = 

Obviously, there was a Jewish synagogue in Corinth. First we are told that the “ruler” (leader) of the synagogue, Crispus, was converted and baptized. Then his successor, Sosthenes, was also converted and became a Christian. This must have had a great impact on the gospel ministry in Corinth. 

显然，在哥林多有一个犹太教堂。首先我们知道犹太教堂的“管理人”(首领)基利司布归主并受洗。然后他的继任者，所提尼也归主成为了基督徒。这对的哥林多的宣教事工一定有很大的影响。

Paul stayed there for about a year and a half. Why did he stay so long in Corinth compared to the time spent in other Greek cities?

保罗在那里呆了大约一年半。为什么他在哥林多呆的时间要比他在其他希腊城市要呆得更久？

###### READ ACTS 18:18-22 (THE 2ND MISSION JOURNEY ENDS)  读使徒行传18：18-22日(第二次宣教旅程结束)

The second mission trip was completed with a stop at Ephesus, before returning to his home church in Antioch with the joyful news of the successful trip. Next week we will hear more about the work in Ephesus.  

第二次宣教完成了, 在其中他也在以弗所停留过。带着成功之旅的喜悦消息，他回到在安提阿的母会。下周我们将听到更多关于以弗所的工作。
 
##### 1 CORINTHIANS 哥林多前书

On the 3rd mission trip, Paul returned to Ephesus where he spent about three years. While there, some members of the Corinthian congregation visited him (1 Corinthians 16:17-18). They told Paul about some of the issues and problems which the Corinthians were having. In addition to the verbal report, there must have been a written letter from the Corinthians that contained some questions they had for Paul (see 1 Corinthians 7:1). Paul wrote this letter to address some of the questions and problems in the church in Corinth. 

在第三次宣教之旅中，保罗回到以弗所，在那大约花了三年时间。在那里，哥林多的一些教友拜访了他(哥林多前书16：17-18日)。他们告诉保罗哥林多存在的一些问题。除了口头报告外，哥林多人还一定写了一封书信请教保罗一些问题(见哥林多前书7：1)。保罗写这封信是针对哥林多教会里的一些疑问和问题。

###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapters 1-4  读哥林多前书，第1至4章

Then answer the following questions: 

然后回答以下问题：

1. What was the problem reported to Paul which is being addressed in these chapters?

    向保罗报告的和在这些章节讲到的问题是哪些？

2. What are some common causes for factions in Christian congregations today? And what is the root cause of these factions.

    什么是今天基督教教会里的分党结派的一些常见的原因？这些分党结派的根源是什么。

    1. Factions choosing favorite pastors. 各派选择他们喜爱的牧师

    2. _____________________________
    
    3. _____________________________

    4. Root Cause: 根源原因:__________
 
3. Why did God choose something that the world considers to be weakness and foolishness as the basis for salvation? (1:18-25)

    为什么神选择世界认为是软弱和愚蠢的作为救赎的基础呢？(1:18-25)
_______________________________________________________________

###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapters 5-6  读哥林多前书第5-6章  

Then answer the following questions: 
          
然后回答下列问题：            

These two chapters deal with matters of human sexuality.  In chapter 5, Paul gives his counsel on the matter of a case of incest in the congregation. The Corinthian Christians allowed the man to continue living in this sinful relationship, and they were even proud of their tolerant spirit. However, Paul rebukes them for failing to properly discipline the sinful man. He advises them to expel the man from their fellowship (excommunication) and “hand  him over to Satan” (v. 2 and 5). 

这两章讲的是人的性方面的问题。在第5章中，保罗就教会中发生的乱伦提出他的观点与建议。哥林多的基督徒允许那人继续生活在这种罪恶的关系中，甚至为他们的宽容精神而自豪。然而，保罗责备他们没有适当地处罚犯罪的人。他建议他们把那个人从他们的团契赶出去并“交给撒旦”（第2和5节）。            

1. What are the two purposes for excommunication? 

    ​赶出教会的两个目的是什么？

    a) v. 3-5  3-5节 __________________________________________________
    
    b) v. 6-8  6-8 节 __________________________________________________

    The Lord has clearly made the congregation responsible for judging and maintaining Christian conduct in its midst (5:12). In chapter 6 the Lord’s apostle supplies an additional example of the kind of judging a Christian congregation is to do. In the second half of the chapter he takes up the background of the case of incest in chapter 5 and corrects the Corinthians’ faulty attitudes toward sex.

    主很清楚要教会对在其中的基督徒负审判和保持基督徒的行为的责任(5：12)。在第6章，主的使徒提供了一个额外的关于基督徒教会应做的审判的例子。在第六章的后半段，他用第5章中讨论的乱伦案件为背景，纠正了哥林多对性的错误态度。

2. In the laws of Moses, sexual purity was simply commanded (“You shall not commit adultery.”) In 6:19-20 Paul approaches the subject of sexual purity in the light of the cross. What is the Christian’s motivation for striving for sexual purity? 

    在摩西律法中，性的纯洁是借着简单的诫命(“不奸淫”)来命令的。 在6：19-20中，保罗从十字架这一角度来论述性纯洁的主题。基督徒追求性纯洁的动机是什么？
 
###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapters 7- 9:23 and 10:23-11:1  读哥林多前书1章7-9:23 和 10:23-11:1

###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapters 9:24-11:34 and 14:26-40  读哥林多前书9:24-11:34 和14:26-40

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答下列问题：  

In these chapters Paul addresses some questions and concerns about the worship services of the Corinthians. At this time, the Christians did not yet have church buildings, so worship took place in the homes of members. And without church bells or clocks, there were no specific starting times for worship.. The Christians would sit around a table, and they would combine a shared meal, prayer, Bible teaching, and the celebration of the Lord’s Supper into a day-long celebration. These celebrations often took place on “the Lord’s day” (Sunday, the day that the Lord rose from the dead), and came to be known as “love (the Greek word for love is aga’pe) feasts.” 

在这些章节中，保罗谈到了哥林多人的礼拜仪式。此时，基督徒还没有教堂的建筑，所以敬拜是在成员的家中进行。没有教堂的钟和表，就没有固定的敬拜起始时间。基督徒们会围坐在一张桌子旁，他们把一起进歺、祈祷、圣经的教导和庆祝主的晚餐结合在一起，成为一整天的庆祝。这些庆祝活动常常发生在“主日”（星期日、主从死里复活之日），又被称为“爱宴（爱的希腊词是aga'pe”）。   

Paul was concerned about a lack of order in these gatherings. The principle that he repeated twice was “everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way” (14:40). He specifically addressed two main concerns:

保罗担心这些聚会缺乏秩序。他重复了两次的原则是“凡事都要规规矩矩地按着次序行”（14:40）。他具体谈到了两个主要问题： 

1) Order in celebrating the Lord’s Supper

2) Order in the teaching of Christian truth 

1）庆祝圣餐的次序             

2）教导基督教真理的秩序

11:20 = 

11:26 = 

11:27 = 

11:28 = 




The second principle of good order involved the role of men and women in Christian worship. What is the main principle that we want to observe in our worship?

良好次序的第二个原则是男人和女人在基督徒敬拜中的角色。我们在敬拜中要遵守的主要原则是什么？

11:3 = 

###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapters 12:1- 14:25  读哥林多前书12：1-14：25

然后回答下面的问题：

These chapters address the subject of spiritual gifts, with a special focus on using our gifts to serve each other in Christian love.

这些章节讲的是属灵恩赐，特别强调用我们的属灵恩赐在基督的爱里服事其他人。

Through Paul, the Lord teaches us that all Christians have been given special gifts or abilities by the Holy Spirit. What is the most important gift of the Holy Spirit, according to 12:3?

神借着保罗教导我们所有的基督徒都有从圣灵来的特别的恩赐或能力。根据12：3，什么是圣灵的最重要的恩赐，？

The Spirit distributes different gifts among the Christians in the congregation. Why have we been given these different gifts, according to 12:7? 

圣灵在教会里给基督徒不同的恩赐。根据12：7，为什么我们有不同的恩赐？

In chapter 14, Paul speaks about the gifts of prophecy and tongues in Christian gatherings. What are the two main principles that must be followed in using these amazing gifts? 

在14章，保罗谈到在基督徒聚会中先知和方言的恩赐。在使用这两个奇妙的恩赐时，该遵循的两个主要的原则是什么？

14:26 =   


14:40 = 


###### READ 1 CORINTHIANS, chapter 15  读哥林多前书，第15章

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

This is the amazing chapter on the resurrection – Christ’s resurrection and our own. It is one of the most important chapters in the Bible.

What are the two central truths of the Gospel which Paul preached? 

保罗传讲的福音的两个中心真理是什么？

v. 3 =  


v. 4 =  

The resurrection of Christ is so important to our faith. In 15:12-19 Paul writes what the consequences would be if Jesus had not really risen from the dead. Write down some of those consequences:  

基督的复活对我们的信仰是如此重要。在15：12-19中，保罗写道，如果耶稣没有真的从死里复活，后果将是什么。写下这些后果中的其中一些：

Then answer the following questions:

然后回答以下问题：

This final chapter addresses one more matter that the Corinthians had asked about, the collection for the needy saints in Judea. There was a famine in Judea at this time, and the Christians there were suffering because of it. The new Christians in Greece were eager to help their Christian brothers and sisters back in Judea, and were contributing toward a relief offering for them. Paul encouraged the Corinthian Christians to participate also. 

最后一章论述了哥林多人所问的另一个问题，即为在犹太的贫困圣徒的捐献。当时犹大有饥荒，那里的基督徒因它而受苦。希腊的新基督徒渴望帮助他们在犹大的基督徒兄弟姐妹，并为他们的救济提供捐助。保罗鼓励哥林多信徒也参与其中。

What principle of Christian giving does Paul teach us in 16:2? 

保罗在16：2教导我们的是什么原则？
