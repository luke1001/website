###### 2 Corinthians 哥林多后书

Before you begin reading this epistle, take time to read this introduction. Some commentaries call this epistle “the most difficult book in the New Testament.” I hope these introductory comments will help us understand it better. 

在你开始读这卷书信之前，请花时间阅读这份介绍。有人说这封书信是“新约最难的书卷”。我盼望这份介绍材料能帮助大家对它有更好的理解。

###### PURPOSE OF THE LETTER  这封书信的写作目的

As we look at the contents of the letter, there seems to have been two main reasons for the apostle to write it.  

当我们阅读这封书信的内容时，会发现使徒写这封书信似乎已经有两个主要原因：

- The collection of an offering for the Judean Christians (who were suffering from famine)

    给犹太信徒收集奉献（因他们正经历饥荒）；

- A defense of Paul’s ministry, which was under attack at Corinth

    对保罗所传福音的防护，因福音当时正被攻击；

The subject of the collection for the needy saints in Judea is covered in chapter 8-9. The remainder of the letter is devoted to a defense of Paul’s ministry. 

给犹太有需要的信徒收集奉献的内容记载在第8-9章。书信的其余部分主要记述对保罗所传福音的防护。

The apostle Paul was probably in Macedonia (northern Greece) when he wrote this letter to the church in Corinth (southern Greece). Titus, one of Paul’s co-workers, had just arrived from Corinth, and given Paul an encouraging report about the church. Paul was greatly relieved by this report, because he had recently made a personal visit (a “painful visit” referred to in 2:1) to Corinth that had not gone very well. 

使徒保罗在给哥林多（希腊南部）教会写这封信时可能在马其顿（希腊北部）。提多，保罗的一位同工，刚从哥林多来，给保罗汇报了教会里令人鼓舞的消息。保罗对这些消息深感欣慰，因为他近期刚刚亲自看望过哥林多教会，那是他们的情形并不好（2：1节中提到了那次“令人痛心的探望”）。

During that visit, referred to in 2:1, Paul had discovered that some men (whom he referred to as “super-apostles” in 11:5) had attacked his integrity and his ministry. Whoever those so-called false apostles were, they had challenged Paul’s apostolic credentials, charging him with being insincere, unreliable, and unloving. Clearly, these troublemakers were enemies of Paul, who had come to undermine his ministry to the Gentiles. What made the visit so painful was that the Corinthians had not come to Paul’s defense, and failed to support him in this conflict. After all that he had done to bring them the Gospel, and after all the joy that his message had brought to them, how could they doubt his sincerity or love? How could they doubt that he was an ambassador of Christ? 

在那次探望中（2：1节提到），保罗发现，有些人（他在11：5节中提到的“最大的使徒”）已经在攻击他的正直和他所传的福音；无论那些所谓的假使徒是谁，他们都是在挑战保罗作为使徒的凭证。他们指控他无诚意、不可靠而且没有爱心。很明显，这些制造麻烦的人是保罗的仇敌，他们的目的就是要拆毁保罗向外邦人所传的福音。这次探望令保罗心痛的原因是哥林多信徒并没有为保罗辩护，也没有在这次冲突中支持他。在他历尽艰辛把福音带给他们之后，在他们从他带给他们的信息中经历了所有那些喜乐之后，他们怎么能再怀疑他的真诚和爱呢？他们怎么能怀疑他是基督的使者呢？

After that painful visit, Paul had gone on to Macedonia, and his heart ached for his dear brothers and sisters in Corinth. He had originally hoped to return to Corinth from Macedonia, but he cancelled that plan for various reasons, instead writing this letter to the Corinthians in response to the report of Titus. 

那次令人痛心的探望之后，保罗继续到了马其顿。他为那些在哥林多的亲爱弟兄姐妹们心痛。他原本希望从马其顿回到哥林多，但后来因各种原因取消了那次行程，只给哥林多的教会写了这封信，作为对提多所报信息的回应。

Later, Paul visited Corinth for the third time, and spent the winter of 57-58 AD there (Acts 20:3). Paul and his companions then took the offering with them and began to retrace their steps into Macedonia, and from there on to Asia and Jerusalem (the end of the 3rd mission journey).

后来，保罗又第三次探望了哥林多，还在那里（公元后57-58年）过了冬（徒20：3）。保罗和他的同伴后来带着捐献开始折回到马其顿，又从那里继续去了亚细亚（亚洲）和耶路撒冷（第三次布道旅行结束时）。

###### AN OUTLINE OF 2 CORINTHIANS 哥林多后书大纲

2nd Corinthians falls into three obvious sections: 

哥林多后书可分成较明显的三个部分：

- Chapters 1-7 = Paul’s explanation of his conduct and apostolic ministry 

    第1-7章=保罗对自己的行为和使徒的侍奉做出解释

- Chapters 8- 9 = The collection for the saints at Jerusalem

    第8-9章=为耶路撒冷圣徒募捐

- Chapters 10–13 = Paul’s vindication of his apostolic authority

    第10-13章=保罗为自己的使徒权柄辩护

###### READ 2 CORINTHIANS, CHAPTERS 1-7 读哥林多后书第1-7章，然后回答下面的问题：

Then answer the following questions

Write down the things that Paul writes in defense of his character and ministry:

写出保罗在以下经文中为自己的品格和福音辩护的话：

- 1:12 = 
- 1: 18 = 
- 1:24 = 
- 2:17 = 
- 3:5 = 
- 4:2 = 
- 4:13 = 
- 5:14 = 
- 5:18 = 
- 6:12 = 

###### READ 2 CORINTHIANS, CHAPTERS 8-9 读林后第8-9章，然后回答下列问题：

Then answer the following questions.

In these chapters Paul focused on the need to complete the offering for the needy saints at Jerusalem. As Paul encouraged the completion of this offering, he placed before the Corinthians and us some key principles of stewardship, principles that guide our giving yet today.

在这些章节中，保罗主要讲述需要完成为耶路撒冷圣徒募捐的事。当保罗鼓励要完成这次募捐时，他在哥林多信徒和我们面前摆出了一些重要的事工原则，这些原则甚至在今天指导我们的奉献。

Write down as many principles of financial stewardship as you can find in these chapters:

从以下经文中尽可能找出处理经济方面的原则：

- 8:5 
- 8:12 = 
- 8:20-21 = 
- 9:5-7 = 
- 9:8-10 = 

In 8:9 Paul says that “though he (Jesus) was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.” How did Jesus become poor?, and what are the riches we receive through his poverty?

在林后8：9节中，保罗说“他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足”。耶稣怎样成了贫穷？我们透过他的贫穷接受到什么富足？




###### READ 2 CORINTHIANS, CHAPTERS 10-13 读林后第10-13章，然后回答下列问题：

Then answer the following questions. 

This section has a strong and emotional tone, as Paul writes this defense of his apostolic ministry. In this section Paul gives a description of these detractors, whom he calls “super-apostles.” Look at these verses again and jot down phrases that describe these false teachers.

保罗在写这部分内容时语气严厉，内心激动。他在为他的使徒职份辩护。保罗在这部分中描述了那些诋毁者，他称他们是“最伟大的使徒”。查看以下经文，写出保罗描述假教师的话语。

- 10:12 = 
- 11:3 = 
- 11:4 = 
- 11:13-15 = 
- 11:22-23 = 
- 12:14 =
