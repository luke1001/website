10. Read 1 Timothy 2:6. For whom did Christ give himself as a ransom?

    读提摩太前书 2:6. 基督为谁把自己献上作为赎价？

11. Read Romans 8:32. For whom did God deliver up his own Son?

    读罗马书8:32 上帝为谁送上自己的儿子？

12. Read 2 Corinthians 5:11-19. For whom did Jesus die? (v.14-15)

    读哥林多后书 5:11-19. 耶稣的死是为了谁？（14-15节）

13. What does it mean when v.19 says that God “reconciled” the world to Himself? (v.19 gives the answer)

    19节里说上帝使世人与他自己“和好”是什么意思？（19节里给出了答案）

14. To “reconcile” means “to not count men’s sins against them.” This is exactly the same as “to justify.” Who has God reconciled (justified) according to v.19?

    “和好”意思是“不再追究他们的过犯” 。这和称义是完全一样的。19节里谁被基督称义了呢?

15. Read Romans 3:3. Does man’s reaction to the Gospel change what God has done?

    读罗马书3:3. 人们对上帝福音的反应会改变上帝所成就的吗？

###### SUMMARY 总结

- Objective justification is universal, for all people of all times and places.

- It was accomplished at one historical point in time, namely when Christ was crucified and rose again from the dead.

- It is independent of man’s reaction to it.

- It is totally complete and requires no additions ever.

- 客观上的称义是普遍的，对所有人，任何时间和地点都适用。

- 它是在一个具体的历史时间点完成的，即基督被钉十字架后又从死者中复活的时候。

- 它不依靠人对它的反应。

- 它是完全的，不需要任何的加添。
 
###### SUBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION 主观上的称义

1. Read Mark 16:15-16. What is the “good news?” To whom is it to be preached? Who will be saved?

    读马可福音 16:15-16。“好消息”是什么？宣讲的对象是谁？谁会被救赎？

2. Read Hebrews 4:2. Who heard the Gospel but did not benefit from it?

    读希伯来书4:2. 谁听了福音而没有受益呢？

3. Read John 1:12. What part does faith play in justification according to this verse?

    读约翰福音1:12. 按照这节，信心在称义中起什么作用？

4. Read Galatians 2:16. How is a person justified?

    读加拉太书 2:16. 一个人是怎样称义的？

5. Read Romans 5:1 and Romans 3:28. How is a person justified?

    读罗马书 5:1 和 3:28. 一个人是怎样称义的？

###### SUMMARY 总结

- Faith is not a cause of justification, nor a condition which must be fulfilled for justification. Faith is that which receives the reconciliation proclaimed in the Gospel.

- Subjective justification is also referred to as “personal justification.”

- Subjective justification is an on-going act, taking place whenever a sinner comes to faith.

- 信心不是称义的原因，也不是称义的必要条件。信心是指接受在福音中宣传的与 神和好。

- 主观上的称义也指“个人的称义”。

- 主观上的称义是正在发生的行为，发生在一个罪人信主的时候。
 
 

“FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.”

因为神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不至灭亡，反得永生。
