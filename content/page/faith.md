What We Believe

We believe that there is only one true God, consisting of three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (John 17:3, Matt. 28:19)

We believe that God gave us the Bible through men whom He chose, and that in a miraculous way the Holy Spirit inspired these men to write His Word. Thus the Bible is the very Word of God. (2 Pet. 1:21)

We believe that God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen 1)

We believe that by nature man is separated from God by sin, and, without a Savior, will be judged by God and be eternally punished in hell. (Rom.6:23)

We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, who made full payment for our sins by His sacrifice on the cross (John 3:16)

We believe that man must receive this payment for himself by faith in Jesus Christ. Justifying faith is trust in Christ and His redemptive work. (John 1:12 and Eph. 2:8-9)

We believe that baptism is a God-ordained holy act through which God himself works or strengthens faith in the individual. It also is a time of full commitment to Christ for adults. (Acts 2:38-39)

We believe that Communion is a God ordained holy act in which the true body and blood of Jesus Christ is present with the bread and wine in a supernatural way for the assurance of forgiveness. (Matt. 26:26, 28)

We believe that on the Last Day Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. (Matt. 25:31-46)

CHRISTIANITY AND GOVERNMENT

We believe that Christians must submit themselves to governing authorities. (Romans 13:1-5)

We believe that Christians must pay their taxes and give respect and honor where each is due. (Romans 13:6-7)

We believe that government is not obligated to subsidize the church. Churches are to be self-supporting, or aided by the generosity of other churches. (2 Cor. 8)

CHRISTIAN LIVING

We believe that the Ten Commandments provide a summary of how a Christian is to live. This involves the highest standards of life toward God, country, and our fellow man. This life includes honesty, morality, contentment, love, and helpful concern for others. This life excludes immorality, lying, stealing, gossip, or any other action harmful to others. (Exodus 20:1-17 et al)
